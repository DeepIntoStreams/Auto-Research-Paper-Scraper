A Bit of Freedom Goes a Long Way: Classical and Quantum Algorithms for Reinforcement Learning under a Generative Model,30/07/2025,"Andris Ambainis, Joao F. Doriguello, Debbie Lim","We propose novel classical and quantum online algorithms for learning
finite-horizon and infinite-horizon average-reward Markov Decision Processes
(MDPs). Our algorithms are based on a hybrid exploration-generative
reinforcement learning (RL) model wherein the agent can, from time to time,
freely interact with the environment in a generative sampling fashion, i.e., by
having access to a ""simulator"". By employing known classical and new quantum
algorithms for approximating optimal policies under a generative model within
our learning algorithms, we show that it is possible to avoid several paradigms
from RL like ""optimism in the face of uncertainty"" and ""posterior sampling"" and
instead compute and use optimal policies directly, which yields better regret
bounds compared to previous works. For finite-horizon MDPs, our quantum
algorithms obtain regret bounds which only depend logarithmically on the number
of time steps $T$, thus breaking the $O(\sqrt{T})$ classical barrier. This
matches the time dependence of the prior quantum works of Ganguly et al.
(arXiv'23) and Zhong et al. (ICML'24), but with improved dependence on other
parameters like state space size $S$ and action space size $A$. For
infinite-horizon MDPs, our classical and quantum bounds still maintain the
$O(\sqrt{T})$ dependence but with better $S$ and $A$ factors. Nonetheless, we
propose a novel measure of regret for infinite-horizon MDPs with respect to
which our quantum algorithms have $\operatorname{poly}\log{T}$ regret,
exponentially better compared to classical algorithms. Finally, we generalise
all of our results to compact state spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22854v1,,False
Order Book Filtration and Directional Signal Extraction at High Frequency,30/07/2025,"Aditya Nittur Anantha, Shashi Jain, Prithwish Maiti","With the advent of electronic capital markets and algorithmic trading agents,
the number of events in tick-by-tick market data has exploded. A large fraction
of these orders is transient. Their ephemeral character degrades the
informativeness of directional alphas derived from the limit order book (LOB)
state. We investigate whether directional signals such as order book imbalance
(OBI) can be improved by structurally filtering high-frequency LOB data. Three
real-time, observable filtration schemes: based on order lifetime, update
count, and inter-update delay. These are used to recompute OBI on structurally
filtered event streams. To assess the effect of filtration, we implement a
three-layer diagnostic framework: contemporaneous correlation with returns,
explanatory power under discretized regime counts, and causal coherence via
Hawkes excitation norms. Empirical results show that structural filtration
improves directional signal clarity in correlation and regime-based metrics,
but leads to only limited gains in causal excitation strength. In contrast, OBI
computed using trade events exhibits stronger causal alignment with future
price movements. These findings highlight the importance of differentiating
between associative and causal diagnostics when designing high-frequency
directional signals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22712v1,,False
Safe Deployment of Offline Reinforcement Learning via Input Convex Action Correction,30/07/2025,"Alex Durkin, Jasper Stolte, Matthew Jones, Raghuraman Pitchumani, Bei Li, Christian Michler, Mehmet Mercangöz","Offline reinforcement learning (offline RL) offers a promising framework for
developing control strategies in chemical process systems using historical
data, without the risks or costs of online experimentation. This work
investigates the application of offline RL to the safe and efficient control of
an exothermic polymerisation continuous stirred-tank reactor. We introduce a
Gymnasium-compatible simulation environment that captures the reactor's
nonlinear dynamics, including reaction kinetics, energy balances, and
operational constraints. The environment supports three industrially relevant
scenarios: startup, grade change down, and grade change up. It also includes
reproducible offline datasets generated from proportional-integral controllers
with randomised tunings, providing a benchmark for evaluating offline RL
algorithms in realistic process control tasks.
  We assess behaviour cloning and implicit Q-learning as baseline algorithms,
highlighting the challenges offline agents face, including steady-state offsets
and degraded performance near setpoints. To address these issues, we propose a
novel deployment-time safety layer that performs gradient-based action
correction using input convex neural networks (PICNNs) as learned cost models.
The PICNN enables real-time, differentiable correction of policy actions by
descending a convex, state-conditioned cost surface, without requiring
retraining or environment interaction.
  Experimental results show that offline RL, particularly when combined with
convex action correction, can outperform traditional control approaches and
maintain stability across all scenarios. These findings demonstrate the
feasibility of integrating offline RL with interpretable and safety-aware
corrections for high-stakes chemical process control, and lay the groundwork
for more reliable data-driven automation in industrial systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22640v1,,False
Pre-trained Models Perform the Best When Token Distributions Follow Zipf's Law,30/07/2025,"Yanjin He, Qingkai Zeng, Meng Jiang","Tokenization is a fundamental step in natural language processing (NLP) and
other sequence modeling domains, where the choice of vocabulary size
significantly impacts model performance. Despite its importance, selecting an
optimal vocabulary size remains underexplored, typically relying on heuristics
or dataset-specific choices. In this work, we propose a principled method for
determining the vocabulary size by analyzing token frequency distributions
through Zipf's law. We show that downstream task performance correlates with
how closely token distributions follow power-law behavior, and that aligning
with Zipfian scaling improves both model efficiency and effectiveness.
Extensive experiments across NLP, genomics, and chemistry demonstrate that
models consistently achieve peak performance when the token distribution
closely adheres to Zipf's law, establishing Zipfian alignment as a robust and
generalizable criterion for vocabulary size selection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22543v1,,False
Physics-constrained generative machine learning-based high-resolution downscaling of Greenland's surface mass balance and surface temperature,30/07/2025,"Nils Bochow, Philipp Hess, Alexander Robinson","Accurate, high-resolution projections of the Greenland ice sheet's surface
mass balance (SMB) and surface temperature are essential for understanding
future sea-level rise, yet current approaches are either computationally
demanding or limited to coarse spatial scales. Here, we introduce a novel
physics-constrained generative modeling framework based on a consistency model
(CM) to downscale low-resolution SMB and surface temperature fields by a factor
of up to 32 (from 160 km to 5 km grid spacing) in a few sampling steps. The CM
is trained on monthly outputs of the regional climate model MARv3.12 and
conditioned on ice-sheet topography and insolation. By enforcing a hard
conservation constraint during inference, we ensure approximate preservation of
SMB and temperature sums on the coarse spatial scale as well as robust
generalization to extreme climate states without retraining. On the test set,
our constrained CM achieves a continued ranked probability score of 6.31 mmWE
for the SMB and 0.1 K for the surface temperature, outperforming
interpolation-based downscaling. Together with spatial power-spectral analysis,
we demonstrate that the CM faithfully reproduces variability across spatial
scales. We further apply bias-corrected outputs of the NorESM2 Earth System
Model as inputs to our CM, to demonstrate the potential of our model to
directly downscale ESM fields. Our approach delivers realistic, high-resolution
climate forcing for ice-sheet simulations with fast inference and can be
readily integrated into Earth-system and ice-sheet model workflows to improve
projections of the future contribution to sea-level rise from Greenland and
potentially other ice sheets and glaciers too.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22485v1,,False
Comparing Normalizing Flows with Kernel Density Estimation in Estimating Risk of Automated Driving Systems,30/07/2025,"Erwin de Gelder, Maren Buermann, Olaf Op den Camp","The development of safety validation methods is essential for the safe
deployment and operation of Automated Driving Systems (ADSs). One of the goals
of safety validation is to prospectively evaluate the risk of an ADS dealing
with real-world traffic. Scenario-based assessment is a widely-used approach,
where test cases are derived from real-world driving data. To allow for a
quantitative analysis of the system performance, the exposure of the scenarios
must be accurately estimated. The exposure of scenarios at parameter level is
expressed using a Probability Density Function (PDF). However, assumptions
about the PDF, such as parameter independence, can introduce errors, while
avoiding assumptions often leads to oversimplified models with limited
parameters to mitigate the curse of dimensionality.
  This paper considers the use of Normalizing Flows (NF) for estimating the PDF
of the parameters. NF are a class of generative models that transform a simple
base distribution into a complex one using a sequence of invertible and
differentiable mappings, enabling flexible, high-dimensional density estimation
without restrictive assumptions on the PDF's shape. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of NF in quantifying risk and risk uncertainty of an ADS,
comparing its performance with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), a traditional
method for non-parametric PDF estimation. While NF require more computational
resources compared to KDE, NF is less sensitive to the curse of dimensionality.
As a result, NF can improve risk uncertainty estimation, offering a more
precise assessment of an ADS's safety.
  This work illustrates the potential of NF in scenario-based safety. Future
work involves experimenting more with using NF for scenario generation and
optimizing the NF architecture, transformation types, and training
hyperparameters to further enhance their applicability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22429v1,,False
Efficient Spatial-Temporal Modeling for Real-Time Video Analysis: A Unified Framework for Action Recognition and Object Tracking,30/07/2025,Shahla John,"Real-time video analysis remains a challenging problem in computer vision,
requiring efficient processing of both spatial and temporal information while
maintaining computational efficiency. Existing approaches often struggle to
balance accuracy and speed, particularly in resource-constrained environments.
In this work, we present a unified framework that leverages advanced
spatial-temporal modeling techniques for simultaneous action recognition and
object tracking. Our approach builds upon recent advances in parallel sequence
modeling and introduces a novel hierarchical attention mechanism that
adaptively focuses on relevant spatial regions across temporal sequences. We
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard
benchmarks while maintaining real-time inference speeds. Extensive experiments
on UCF-101, HMDB-51, and MOT17 datasets show improvements of 3.2% in action
recognition accuracy and 2.8% in tracking precision compared to existing
methods, with 40% faster inference time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22421v1,,False
Aleatoric Uncertainty Medical Image Segmentation Estimation via Flow Matching,30/07/2025,"Phi Van Nguyen, Ngoc Huynh Trinh, Duy Minh Lam Nguyen, Phu Loc Nguyen, Quoc Long Tran","Quantifying aleatoric uncertainty in medical image segmentation is critical
since it is a reflection of the natural variability observed among expert
annotators. A conventional approach is to model the segmentation distribution
using the generative model, but current methods limit the expression ability of
generative models. While current diffusion-based approaches have demonstrated
impressive performance in approximating the data distribution, their inherent
stochastic sampling process and inability to model exact densities limit their
effectiveness in accurately capturing uncertainty. In contrast, our proposed
method leverages conditional flow matching, a simulation-free flow-based
generative model that learns an exact density, to produce highly accurate
segmentation results. By guiding the flow model on the input image and sampling
multiple data points, our approach synthesizes segmentation samples whose
pixel-wise variance reliably reflects the underlying data distribution. This
sampling strategy captures uncertainties in regions with ambiguous boundaries,
offering robust quantification that mirrors inter-annotator differences.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only achieves competitive
segmentation accuracy but also generates uncertainty maps that provide deeper
insights into the reliability of the segmentation outcomes. The code for this

Improving Generalization Ability of Robotic Imitation Learning by Resolving Causal Confusion in Observations,30/07/2025,"Yifei Chen, Yuzhe Zhang, Giovanni D'urso, Nicholas Lawrance, Brendan Tidd","Recent developments in imitation learning have considerably advanced robotic
manipulation. However, current techniques in imitation learning can suffer from
poor generalization, limiting performance even under relatively minor domain
shifts. In this work, we aim to enhance the generalization capabilities of
complex imitation learning algorithms to handle unpredictable changes from the
training environments to deployment environments. To avoid confusion caused by
observations that are not relevant to the target task, we propose to explicitly
learn the causal relationship between observation components and expert
actions, employing a framework similar to [6], where a causal structural
function is learned by intervention on the imitation learning policy.
Disentangling the feature representation from image input as in [6] is hard to
satisfy in complex imitation learning process in robotic manipulation, we
theoretically clarify that this requirement is not necessary in causal
relationship learning. Therefore, we propose a simple causal structure learning
framework that can be easily embedded in recent imitation learning
architectures, such as the Action Chunking Transformer [31]. We demonstrate our
approach using a simulation of the ALOHA [31] bimanual robot arms in Mujoco,
and show that the method can considerably mitigate the generalization problem
of existing complex imitation learning algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22380v1,,False
CS-SHRED: Enhancing SHRED for Robust Recovery of Spatiotemporal Dynamics,30/07/2025,"Romulo B. da Silva, Cássio M. Oishi, Diego Passos, J. Nathan Kutz","We present $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$, a novel deep learning architecture that
integrates Compressed Sensing (CS) into a Shallow Recurrent Decoder
($\textbf{SHRED}$) to reconstruct spatiotemporal dynamics from incomplete,
compressed, or corrupted data. Our approach introduces two key innovations.
First, by incorporating CS techniques into the $\textbf{SHRED}$ architecture,
our method leverages a batch-based forward framework with $\ell_1$
regularization to robustly recover signals even in scenarios with sparse sensor
placements, noisy measurements, and incomplete sensor acquisitions. Second, an
adaptive loss function dynamically combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean
Absolute Error (MAE) terms with a piecewise Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR)
regularization, which suppresses noise and outliers in low-SNR regions while
preserving fine-scale features in high-SNR regions.
  We validate $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ on challenging problems including
viscoelastic fluid flows, maximum specific humidity fields, sea surface
temperature distributions, and rotating turbulent flows. Compared to the
traditional $\textbf{SHRED}$ approach, $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ achieves
significantly higher reconstruction fidelity - as demonstrated by improved SSIM
and PSNR values, lower normalized errors, and enhanced LPIPS scores-thereby
providing superior preservation of small-scale structures and increased
robustness against noise and outliers.
  Our results underscore the advantages of the jointly trained CS and SHRED
design architecture which includes an LSTM sequence model for characterizing
the temporal evolution with a shallow decoder network (SDN) for modeling the
high-dimensional state space. The SNR-guided adaptive loss function for the
spatiotemporal data recovery establishes $\textbf{CS-SHRED}$ as a promising
tool for a wide range of applications in environmental, climatic, and
scientific data analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.22303v1,,False
