DICE: Discrete Inversion Enabling Controllable Editing for Multinomial Diffusion and Masked Generative Models,10/10/2024,"Xiaoxiao He, Ligong Han, Quan Dao, Song Wen, Minhao Bai, Di Liu, Han Zhang, Martin Renqiang Min, Felix Juefei-Xu, Chaowei Tan, Bo Liu, Kang Li, Hongdong Li, Junzhou Huang, Faez Ahmed, Akash Srivastava, Dimitris Metaxas","Discrete diffusion models have achieved success in tasks like image
generation and masked language modeling but face limitations in controlled
content editing. We introduce DICE (Discrete Inversion for Controllable
Editing), the first approach to enable precise inversion for discrete diffusion
models, including multinomial diffusion and masked generative models. By
recording noise sequences and masking patterns during the reverse diffusion
process, DICE enables accurate reconstruction and flexible editing of discrete
data without the need for predefined masks or attention manipulation. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of DICE across both image and text domains,
evaluating it on models such as VQ-Diffusion, Paella, and RoBERTa. Our results
show that DICE preserves high data fidelity while enhancing editing
capabilities, offering new opportunities for fine-grained content manipulation

DifFRelight: Diffusion-Based Facial Performance Relighting,10/10/2024,"Mingming He, Pascal Clausen, Ahmet Levent Taşel, Li Ma, Oliver Pilarski, Wenqi Xian, Laszlo Rikker, Xueming Yu, Ryan Burgert, Ning Yu, Paul Debevec","We present a novel framework for free-viewpoint facial performance relighting
using diffusion-based image-to-image translation. Leveraging a subject-specific
dataset containing diverse facial expressions captured under various lighting
conditions, including flat-lit and one-light-at-a-time (OLAT) scenarios, we
train a diffusion model for precise lighting control, enabling high-fidelity
relit facial images from flat-lit inputs. Our framework includes
spatially-aligned conditioning of flat-lit captures and random noise, along
with integrated lighting information for global control, utilizing prior
knowledge from the pre-trained Stable Diffusion model. This model is then
applied to dynamic facial performances captured in a consistent flat-lit
environment and reconstructed for novel-view synthesis using a scalable dynamic
3D Gaussian Splatting method to maintain quality and consistency in the relit
results. In addition, we introduce unified lighting control by integrating a
novel area lighting representation with directional lighting, allowing for
joint adjustments in light size and direction. We also enable high dynamic
range imaging (HDRI) composition using multiple directional lights to produce
dynamic sequences under complex lighting conditions. Our evaluations
demonstrate the models efficiency in achieving precise lighting control and
generalizing across various facial expressions while preserving detailed
features such as skintexture andhair. The model accurately reproduces complex
lighting effects like eye reflections, subsurface scattering, self-shadowing,

On the Evaluation of Generative Robotic Simulations,10/10/2024,"Feng Chen, Botian Xu, Pu Hua, Peiqi Duan, Yanchao Yang, Yi Ma, Huazhe Xu","Due to the difficulty of acquiring extensive real-world data, robot
simulation has become crucial for parallel training and sim-to-real transfer,
highlighting the importance of scalable simulated robotic tasks. Foundation
models have demonstrated impressive capacities in autonomously generating
feasible robotic tasks. However, this new paradigm underscores the challenge of
adequately evaluating these autonomously generated tasks. To address this, we
propose a comprehensive evaluation framework tailored to generative
simulations. Our framework segments evaluation into three core aspects:
quality, diversity, and generalization. For single-task quality, we evaluate
the realism of the generated task and the completeness of the generated
trajectories using large language models and vision-language models. In terms
of diversity, we measure both task and data diversity through text similarity
of task descriptions and world model loss trained on collected task
trajectories. For task-level generalization, we assess the zero-shot
generalization ability on unseen tasks of a policy trained with multiple
generated tasks. Experiments conducted on three representative task generation
pipelines demonstrate that the results from our framework are highly consistent
with human evaluations, confirming the feasibility and validity of our
approach. The findings reveal that while metrics of quality and diversity can
be achieved through certain methods, no single approach excels across all
metrics, suggesting a need for greater focus on balancing these different
metrics. Additionally, our analysis further highlights the common challenge of
low generalization capability faced by current works. Our anonymous website:

Steering Masked Discrete Diffusion Models via Discrete Denoising Posterior Prediction,10/10/2024,"Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Mohsin Hasan, Zhangzhi Peng, Zachary Quinn, Chenghao Liu, Sarthak Mittal, Nouha Dziri, Michael Bronstein, Yoshua Bengio, Pranam Chatterjee, Alexander Tong, Avishek Joey Bose","Generative modeling of discrete data underlies important applications
spanning text-based agents like ChatGPT to the design of the very building
blocks of life in protein sequences. However, application domains need to exert
control over the generated data by steering the generative process - typically
via RLHF - to satisfy a specified property, reward, or affinity metric. In this
paper, we study the problem of steering Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs), a
recent class of discrete diffusion models that offer a compelling alternative
to traditional autoregressive models. We introduce Discrete Denoising Posterior
Prediction (DDPP), a novel framework that casts the task of steering
pre-trained MDMs as a problem of probabilistic inference by learning to sample
from a target Bayesian posterior. Our DDPP framework leads to a family of three
novel objectives that are all simulation-free, and thus scalable while applying
to general non-differentiable reward functions. Empirically, we instantiate
DDPP by steering MDMs to perform class-conditional pixel-level image modeling,
RLHF-based alignment of MDMs using text-based rewards, and finetuning protein
language models to generate more diverse secondary structures and shorter
proteins. We substantiate our designs via wet-lab validation, where we observe
transient expression of reward-optimized protein sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08134v1,,False
Assessing Episodic Memory in LLMs with Sequence Order Recall Tasks,10/10/2024,"Mathis Pink, Vy A. Vo, Qinyuan Wu, Jianing Mu, Javier S. Turek, Uri Hasson, Kenneth A. Norman, Sebastian Michelmann, Alexander Huth, Mariya Toneva","Current LLM benchmarks focus on evaluating models' memory of facts and
semantic relations, primarily assessing semantic aspects of long-term memory.
However, in humans, long-term memory also includes episodic memory, which links
memories to their contexts, such as the time and place they occurred. The
ability to contextualize memories is crucial for many cognitive tasks and
everyday functions. This form of memory has not been evaluated in LLMs with
existing benchmarks. To address the gap in evaluating memory in LLMs, we
introduce Sequence Order Recall Tasks (SORT), which we adapt from tasks used to
study episodic memory in cognitive psychology. SORT requires LLMs to recall the
correct order of text segments, and provides a general framework that is both
easily extendable and does not require any additional annotations. We present
an initial evaluation dataset, Book-SORT, comprising 36k pairs of segments
extracted from 9 books recently added to the public domain. Based on a human
experiment with 155 participants, we show that humans can recall sequence order
based on long-term memory of a book. We find that models can perform the task
with high accuracy when relevant text is given in-context during the SORT
evaluation. However, when presented with the book text only during training,
LLMs' performance on SORT falls short. By allowing to evaluate more aspects of
memory, we believe that SORT will aid in the emerging development of
memory-augmented models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08133v1,,False
Deconstructing equivariant representations in molecular systems,10/10/2024,"Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret","Recent equivariant models have shown significant progress in not just
chemical property prediction, but as surrogates for dynamical simulations of
molecules and materials. Many of the top performing models in this category are
built within the framework of tensor products, which preserves equivariance by
restricting interactions and transformations to those that are allowed by
symmetry selection rules. Despite being a core part of the modeling process,
there has not yet been much attention into understanding what information
persists in these equivariant representations, and their general behavior
outside of benchmark metrics. In this work, we report on a set of experiments
using a simple equivariant graph convolution model on the QM9 dataset, focusing
on correlating quantitative performance with the resulting molecular graph
embeddings. Our key finding is that, for a scalar prediction task, many of the
irreducible representations are simply ignored during training -- specifically
those pertaining to vector ($l=1$) and tensor quantities ($l=2$) -- an issue
that does not necessarily make itself evident in the test metric. We
empirically show that removing some unused orders of spherical harmonics
improves model performance, correlating with improved latent space structure.
We provide a number of recommendations for future experiments to try and
improve efficiency and utilization of equivariant features based on these
observations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08131v1,,False
Generalizing Stochastic Smoothing for Differentiation and Gradient Estimation,10/10/2024,"Felix Petersen, Christian Borgelt, Aashwin Mishra, Stefano Ermon","We deal with the problem of gradient estimation for stochastic differentiable
relaxations of algorithms, operators, simulators, and other non-differentiable
functions. Stochastic smoothing conventionally perturbs the input of a
non-differentiable function with a differentiable density distribution with
full support, smoothing it and enabling gradient estimation. Our theory starts
at first principles to derive stochastic smoothing with reduced assumptions,
without requiring a differentiable density nor full support, and we present a
general framework for relaxation and gradient estimation of non-differentiable
black-box functions $f:\mathbb{R}^n\to\mathbb{R}^m$. We develop variance

Closing the Loop: Learning to Generate Writing Feedback via Language Model Simulated Student Revisions,10/10/2024,"Inderjeet Nair, Jiaye Tan, Xiaotian Su, Anne Gere, Xu Wang, Lu Wang","Providing feedback is widely recognized as crucial for refining students'
writing skills. Recent advances in language models (LMs) have made it possible
to automatically generate feedback that is actionable and well-aligned with
human-specified attributes. However, it remains unclear whether the feedback
generated by these models is truly effective in enhancing the quality of
student revisions. Moreover, prompting LMs with a precise set of instructions
to generate feedback is nontrivial due to the lack of consensus regarding the
specific attributes that can lead to improved revising performance. To address
these challenges, we propose PROF that PROduces Feedback via learning from LM
simulated student revisions. PROF aims to iteratively optimize the feedback
generator by directly maximizing the effectiveness of students' overall
revising performance as simulated by LMs. Focusing on an economic essay
assignment, we empirically test the efficacy of PROF and observe that our
approach not only surpasses a variety of baseline methods in effectiveness of
improving students' writing but also demonstrates enhanced pedagogical values,

Generalization Bounds and Model Complexity for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks,10/10/2024,"Xianyang Zhang, Huijuan Zhou","Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) is a network structure recently proposed by
Liu et al. (2024) that offers improved interpretability and a more parsimonious
design in many science-oriented tasks compared to multi-layer perceptrons. This
work provides a rigorous theoretical analysis of KAN by establishing
generalization bounds for KAN equipped with activation functions that are
either represented by linear combinations of basis functions or lying in a
low-rank Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). In the first case, the
generalization bound accommodates various choices of basis functions in forming
the activation functions in each layer of KAN and is adapted to different
operator norms at each layer. For a particular choice of operator norms, the
bound scales with the $l_1$ norm of the coefficient matrices and the Lipschitz
constants for the activation functions, and it has no dependence on
combinatorial parameters (e.g., number of nodes) outside of logarithmic
factors. Moreover, our result does not require the boundedness assumption on
the loss function and, hence, is applicable to a general class of
regression-type loss functions. In the low-rank case, the generalization bound
scales polynomially with the underlying ranks as well as the Lipschitz
constants of the activation functions in each layer. These bounds are
empirically investigated for KANs trained with stochastic gradient descent on
simulated and real data sets. The numerical results demonstrate the practical
relevance of these bounds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08026v1,,False
Doob's Lagrangian: A Sample-Efficient Variational Approach to Transition Path Sampling,10/10/2024,"Yuanqi Du, Michael Plainer, Rob Brekelmans, Chenru Duan, Frank Noé, Carla P. Gomes, Alan Apsuru-Guzik, Kirill Neklyudov","Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in
the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to
an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical
system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of
conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is
definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of
this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many
forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we
propose a variational formulation of Doob's $h$-transform as an optimization
problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending
point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training
objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary
conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over
trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient
importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We
demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on
real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07974v1,,False
Benchmarking Agentic Workflow Generation,10/10/2024,"Shuofei Qiao, Runnan Fang, Zhisong Qiu, Xiaobin Wang, Ningyu Zhang, Yong Jiang, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Huajun Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs), with their exceptional ability to handle a wide
range of tasks, have driven significant advancements in tackling reasoning and

System-2 Reasoning via Generality and Adaptation,10/10/2024,"Sejin Kim, Sundong Kim","While significant progress has been made in task-specific applications,
current models struggle with deep reasoning, generality, and adaptation -- key
components of System-2 reasoning that are crucial for achieving Artificial
General Intelligence (AGI). Despite the promise of approaches such as program

generalize beyond their training data and to adapt to novel tasks, limiting
their ability to perform human-like reasoning. This paper explores the
limitations of existing approaches in achieving advanced System-2 reasoning and
highlights the importance of generality and adaptation for AGI. Moreover, we
propose four key research directions to address these gaps: (1) learning human
intentions from action sequences, (2) combining symbolic and neural models, (3)
meta-learning for unfamiliar environments, and (4) reinforcement learning to

Masked Generative Priors Improve World Models Sequence Modelling Capabilities,10/10/2024,"Cristian Meo, Mircea Lica, Zarif Ikram, Akihiro Nakano, Vedant Shah, Aniket Rajiv Didolkar, Dianbo Liu, Anirudh Goyal, Justin Dauwels","Deep Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become the leading approach for creating
artificial agents in complex environments. Model-based approaches, which are RL
methods with world models that predict environment dynamics, are among the most
promising directions for improving data efficiency, forming a critical step
toward bridging the gap between research and real-world deployment. In
particular, world models enhance sample efficiency by learning in imagination,
which involves training a generative sequence model of the environment in a
self-supervised manner. Recently, Masked Generative Modelling has emerged as a
more efficient and superior inductive bias for modelling and generating token
sequences. Building on the Efficient Stochastic Transformer-based World Models
(STORM) architecture, we replace the traditional MLP prior with a Masked
Generative Prior (e.g., MaskGIT Prior) and introduce GIT-STORM. We evaluate our
model on two downstream tasks: reinforcement learning and video prediction.
GIT-STORM demonstrates substantial performance gains in RL tasks on the Atari
100k benchmark. Moreover, we apply Transformer-based World Models to continuous
action environments for the first time, addressing a significant gap in prior
research. To achieve this, we employ a state mixer function that integrates
latent state representations with actions, enabling our model to handle
continuous control tasks. We validate this approach through qualitative and

Deep and Probabilistic Solar Irradiance Forecast at the Arctic Circle,10/10/2024,"Niklas Erdmann, Lars Ø. Bentsen, Roy Stenbro, Heine N. Riise, Narada Warakagoda, Paal Engelstad","Solar irradiance forecasts can be dynamic and unreliable due to changing
weather conditions. Near the Arctic circle, this also translates into a
distinct set of further challenges. This work is forecasting solar irradiance
with Norwegian data using variations of Long-Short-Term Memory units (LSTMs).
In order to gain more trustworthiness of results, the probabilistic approaches
Quantile Regression (QR) and Maximum Likelihood (MLE) are optimized on top of
the LSTMs, providing measures of uncertainty for the results. MLE is further
extended by using a Johnson's SU distribution, a Johnson's SB distribution, and
a Weibull distribution in addition to a normal Gaussian to model parameters.
Contrary to a Gaussian, Weibull, Johnson's SU and Johnson's SB can return
skewed distributions, enabling it to fit the non-normal solar irradiance
distribution more optimally. The LSTMs are compared against each other, a
simple Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP), and a smart-persistence estimator. The
proposed LSTMs are found to be more accurate than smart persistence and the MLP
for a multi-horizon, day-ahead (36 hours) forecast. The deterministic LSTM
showed better root mean squared error (RMSE), but worse mean absolute error
(MAE) than a MLE with Johnson's SB distribution. Probabilistic uncertainty
estimation is shown to fit relatively well across the distribution of observed
irradiance. While QR shows better uncertainty estimation calibration, MLE with
Johnson's SB, Johnson's SU, or Gaussian show better performance in the other

estimation calibration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.07806v1,,False
Synthesizing Multi-Class Surgical Datasets with Anatomy-Aware Diffusion Models,10/10/2024,"Danush Kumar Venkatesh, Dominik Rivoir, Micha Pfeiffer, Fiona Kolbinger, Stefanie Speidel","In computer-assisted surgery, automatically recognizing anatomical organs is
crucial for understanding the surgical scene and providing intraoperative

Theoretical limits of descending $\ell_0$ sparse-regression ML algorithms,10/10/2024,Mihailo Stojnic,"We study the theoretical limits of the $\ell_0$ (quasi) norm based

Conditional Lagrangian Wasserstein Flow for Time Series Imputation,10/10/2024,"Weizhu Qian, Dalin Zhang, Yan Zhao","Time series imputation is important for numerous real-world applications. To
overcome the limitations of diffusion model-based imputation methods, e.g.,
slow convergence in inference, we propose a novel method for time series

proposed method leverages the (conditional) optimal transport theory to learn
the probability flow in a simulation-free manner, in which the initial noise,
missing data, and observations are treated as the source distribution, target

principle of least action in Lagrangian mechanics, we learn the velocity by
minimizing the corresponding kinetic energy. Moreover, to incorporate more
prior information into the model, we parameterize the derivative of a
task-specific potential function via a variational autoencoder, and combine it
with the base estimator to formulate a Rao-Blackwellized sampler. The propose
model allows us to take less intermediate steps to produce high-quality samples
