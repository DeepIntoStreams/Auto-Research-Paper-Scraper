Navigation World Models,04/12/2024,"Amir Bar, Gaoyue Zhou, Danny Tran, Trevor Darrell, Yann LeCun","Navigation is a fundamental skill of agents with visual-motor capabilities.
We introduce a Navigation World Model (NWM), a controllable video generation
model that predicts future visual observations based on past observations and
navigation actions. To capture complex environment dynamics, NWM employs a
Conditional Diffusion Transformer (CDiT), trained on a diverse collection of
egocentric videos of both human and robotic agents, and scaled up to 1 billion
parameters. In familiar environments, NWM can plan navigation trajectories by
simulating them and evaluating whether they achieve the desired goal. Unlike
supervised navigation policies with fixed behavior, NWM can dynamically
incorporate constraints during planning. Experiments demonstrate its
effectiveness in planning trajectories from scratch or by ranking trajectories
sampled from an external policy. Furthermore, NWM leverages its learned visual
priors to imagine trajectories in unfamiliar environments from a single input
image, making it a flexible and powerful tool for next-generation navigation
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03572v1,,False
The Matrix: Infinite-Horizon World Generation with Real-Time Moving Control,04/12/2024,"Ruili Feng, Han Zhang, Zhantao Yang, Jie Xiao, Zhilei Shu, Zhiheng Liu, Andy Zheng, Yukun Huang, Yu Liu, Hongyang Zhang","We present The Matrix, the first foundational realistic world simulator
capable of generating continuous 720p high-fidelity real-scene video streams
with real-time, responsive control in both first- and third-person
perspectives, enabling immersive exploration of richly dynamic environments.
Trained on limited supervised data from AAA games like Forza Horizon 5 and
Cyberpunk 2077, complemented by large-scale unsupervised footage from
real-world settings like Tokyo streets, The Matrix allows users to traverse
diverse terrains -- deserts, grasslands, water bodies, and urban landscapes --
in continuous, uncut hour-long sequences. Operating at 16 FPS, the system
supports real-time interactivity and demonstrates zero-shot generalization,
translating virtual game environments to real-world contexts where collecting
continuous movement data is often infeasible. For example, The Matrix can
simulate a BMW X3 driving through an office setting--an environment present in
neither gaming data nor real-world sources. This approach showcases the
potential of AAA game data to advance robust world models, bridging the gap
between simulations and real-world applications in scenarios with limited data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03568v1,,False
NODE-AdvGAN: Improving the transferability and perceptual similarity of adversarial examples by dynamic-system-driven adversarial generative model,04/12/2024,"Xinheng Xie, Yue Wu, Cuiyu He","Understanding adversarial examples is crucial for improving the model's
robustness, as they introduce imperceptible perturbations that deceive models.
Effective adversarial examples, therefore, offer the potential to train more
robust models by removing their singularities. We propose NODE-AdvGAN, a novel
approach that treats adversarial generation as a continuous process and employs
a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (NODE) for simulating the dynamics of
the generator. By mimicking the iterative nature of traditional gradient-based
methods, NODE-AdvGAN generates smoother and more precise perturbations that
preserve high perceptual similarity when added to benign images. We also
propose a new training strategy, NODE-AdvGAN-T, which enhances transferability
in black-box attacks by effectively tuning noise parameters during training.
Experiments demonstrate that NODE-AdvGAN and NODE-AdvGAN-T generate more
effective adversarial examples that achieve higher attack success rates while
preserving better perceptual quality than traditional GAN-based methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03539v1,,False
Soft Checksums to Flag Untrustworthy Machine Learning Surrogate Predictions and Application to Atomic Physics Simulations,04/12/2024,"Casey Lauer, Robert C. Blake, Jonathan B. Freund","Trained neural networks (NN) are attractive as surrogate models to replace
costly calculations in physical simulations, but are often unknowingly applied
to states not adequately represented in the training dataset. We present the
novel technique of soft checksums for scientific machine learning, a
general-purpose method to differentiate between trustworthy predictions with
small errors on in-distribution (ID) data points, and untrustworthy predictions
with large errors on out-of-distribution (OOD) data points. By adding a check
node to the existing output layer, we train the model to learn the chosen
checksum function encoded within the NN predictions and show that violations of
this function correlate with high prediction errors. As the checksum function
depends only on the NN predictions, we can calculate the checksum error for any
prediction with a single forward pass, incurring negligible time and memory
costs. Additionally, we find that incorporating the checksum function into the
loss function and exposing the NN to OOD data points during the training
process improves separation between ID and OOD predictions. By applying soft
checksums to a physically complex and high-dimensional non-local thermodynamic
equilibrium atomic physics dataset, we show that a well-chosen threshold
checksum error can effectively separate ID and OOD predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03497v1,,False
From Words to Workflows: Automating Business Processes,04/12/2024,"Laura Minkova, Jessica López Espejel, Taki Eddine Toufik Djaidja, Walid Dahhane, El Hassane Ettifouri","As businesses increasingly rely on automation to streamline operations, the
limitations of Robotic Process Automation (RPA) have become apparent,
particularly its dependence on expert knowledge and inability to handle complex
decision-making tasks. Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI),
particularly Generative AI (GenAI) and Large Language Models (LLMs), have paved
the way for Intelligent Automation (IA), which integrates cognitive
capabilities to overcome the shortcomings of RPA. This paper introduces
Text2Workflow, a novel method that automatically generates workflows from
natural language user requests. Unlike traditional automation approaches,
Text2Workflow offers a generalized solution for automating any business
process, translating user inputs into a sequence of executable steps
represented in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format. Leveraging the
decision-making and instruction-following capabilities of LLMs, this method
provides a scalable, adaptable framework that enables users to visualize and
execute workflows with minimal manual intervention. This research outlines the
Text2Workflow methodology and its broader implications for automating complex
business processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03446v1,,False
Assessing Foundation Models' Transferability to Physiological Signals in Precision Medicine,04/12/2024,"Matthias Christenson, Cove Geary, Brian Locke, Pranav Koirala, Warren Woodrich Pettine","The success of precision medicine requires computational models that can
effectively process and interpret diverse physiological signals across
heterogeneous patient populations. While foundation models have demonstrated
remarkable transfer capabilities across various domains, their effectiveness in
handling individual-specific physiological signals - crucial for precision
medicine - remains largely unexplored. This work introduces a systematic
pipeline for rapidly and efficiently evaluating foundation models' transfer
capabilities in medical contexts. Our pipeline employs a three-stage approach.
First, it leverages physiological simulation software to generate diverse,
clinically relevant scenarios, particularly focusing on data-scarce medical
conditions. This simulation-based approach enables both targeted capability
assessment and subsequent model fine-tuning. Second, the pipeline projects
these simulated signals through the foundation model to obtain embeddings,
which are then evaluated using linear methods. This evaluation quantifies the
model's ability to capture three critical aspects: physiological feature
independence, temporal dynamics preservation, and medical scenario
differentiation. Finally, the pipeline validates these representations through
specific downstream medical tasks. Initial testing of our pipeline on the
Moirai time series foundation model revealed significant limitations in
physiological signal processing, including feature entanglement, temporal
dynamics distortion, and reduced scenario discrimination. These findings
suggest that current foundation models may require substantial architectural
modifications or targeted fine-tuning before deployment in clinical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03427v1,,False
Automated Test-Case Generation for REST APIs Using Model Inference Search Heuristic,04/12/2024,"Clinton Cao, Annibale Panichella, Sicco Verwer","The rising popularity of the microservice architectural style has led to a
growing demand for automated testing approaches tailored to these systems.
EvoMaster is a state-of-the-art tool that uses Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) to
automatically generate test cases for microservices' REST APIs. One limitation
of these EAs is the use of unit-level search heuristics, such as branch
distances, which focus on fine-grained code coverage and may not effectively
capture the complex, interconnected behaviors characteristic of system-level
testing. To address this limitation, we propose a new search heuristic (MISH)
that uses real-time automaton learning to guide the test case generation
process. We capture the sequential call patterns exhibited by a test case by
learning an automaton from the stream of log events outputted by different
microservices within the same system. Therefore, MISH learns a representation
of the systemwide behavior, allowing us to define the fitness of a test case
based on the path it traverses within the inferred automaton. We empirically
evaluate MISH's effectiveness on six real-world benchmark microservice
applications and compare it against a state-of-the-art technique, MOSA, for
testing REST APIs. Our evaluation shows promising results for using MISH to
guide the automated test case generation within EvoMaster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03420v1,,False
Can neural operators always be continuously discretized?,04/12/2024,"Takashi Furuya, Michael Puthawala, Maarten V. de Hoop, Matti Lassas","We consider the problem of discretization of neural operators between Hilbert
spaces in a general framework including skip connections. We focus on bijective
neural operators through the lens of diffeomorphisms in infinite dimensions.
Framed using category theory, we give a no-go theorem that shows that
diffeomorphisms between Hilbert spaces or Hilbert manifolds may not admit any
continuous approximations by diffeomorphisms on finite-dimensional spaces, even
if the approximations are nonlinear. The natural way out is the introduction of
strongly monotone diffeomorphisms and layerwise strongly monotone neural
operators which have continuous approximations by strongly monotone
diffeomorphisms on finite-dimensional spaces. For these, one can guarantee
discretization invariance, while ensuring that finite-dimensional
approximations converge not only as sequences of functions, but that their
representations converge in a suitable sense as well. Finally, we show that
bilipschitz neural operators may always be written in the form of an
alternating composition of strongly monotone neural operators, plus a simple
isometry. Thus we realize a rigorous platform for discretization of a
generalization of a neural operator. We also show that neural operators of this
type may be approximated through the composition of finite-rank residual neural
operators, where each block is strongly monotone, and may be inverted locally
via iteration. We conclude by providing a quantitative approximation result for
the discretization of general bilipschitz neural operators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03393v1,,False
Intuitive Axial Augmentation Using Polar-Sine-Based Piecewise Distortion for Medical Slice-Wise Segmentation,04/12/2024,"Yiqin Zhang, Qingkui Chen, Chen Huang, Zhengjie Zhang, Meiling Chen, Zhibing Fu","Most data-driven models for medical image analysis rely on universal
augmentations to improve performance. Experimental evidence has confirmed their
effectiveness, but the unclear mechanism underlying them poses a barrier to the
widespread acceptance and trust in such methods within the medical community.
We revisit and acknowledge the unique characteristics of medical images apart
from traditional digital images, and consequently, proposed a medical-specific
augmentation algorithm that is more elastic and aligns well with radiology scan
procedure. The method performs piecewise affine with sinusoidal distorted ray
according to radius on polar coordinates, thus simulating uncertain postures of
human lying flat on the scanning table. Our method could generate human
visceral distribution without affecting the fundamental relative position on
axial plane. Two non-adaptive algorithms, namely Meta-based Scan Table Removal
and Similarity-Guided Parameter Search, are introduced to bolster robustness of
our augmentation method. Experiments show our method improves accuracy across
multiple famous segmentation frameworks without requiring more data samples.

Scalable Bayesian Tensor Ring Factorization for Multiway Data Analysis,04/12/2024,"Zerui Tao, Toshihisa Tanaka, Qibin Zhao","Tensor decompositions play a crucial role in numerous applications related to
multi-way data analysis. By employing a Bayesian framework with
sparsity-inducing priors, Bayesian Tensor Ring (BTR) factorization offers
probabilistic estimates and an effective approach for automatically adapting
the tensor ring rank during the learning process. However, previous BTR method
employs an Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) prior, which can lead to
sub-optimal solutions. Besides, it solely focuses on continuous data, whereas
many applications involve discrete data. More importantly, it relies on the
Coordinate-Ascent Variational Inference (CAVI) algorithm, which is inadequate
for handling large tensors with extensive observations. These limitations
greatly limit its application scales and scopes, making it suitable only for
small-scale problems, such as image/video completion. To address these issues,
we propose a novel BTR model that incorporates a nonparametric Multiplicative
Gamma Process (MGP) prior, known for its superior accuracy in identifying
latent structures. To handle discrete data, we introduce the P\'olya-Gamma
augmentation for closed-form updates. Furthermore, we develop an efficient
Gibbs sampler for consistent posterior simulation, which reduces the
computational complexity of previous VI algorithm by two orders, and an online
EM algorithm that is scalable to extremely large tensors. To showcase the
advantages of our model, we conduct extensive experiments on both simulation
data and real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03321v1,,False
Semi-decentralized Training of Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Networks for Traffic Prediction,04/12/2024,"Ivan Kralj, Lodovico Giaretta, Gordan Ježić, Ivana Podnar Žarko, Šarūnas Girdzijauskas","In smart mobility, large networks of geographically distributed sensors
produce vast amounts of high-frequency spatio-temporal data that must be
processed in real time to avoid major disruptions. Traditional centralized
approaches are increasingly unsuitable to this task, as they struggle to scale
with expanding sensor networks, and reliability issues in central components
can easily affect the whole deployment. To address these challenges, we explore
and adapt semi-decentralized training techniques for Spatio-Temporal Graph
Neural Networks (ST-GNNs) in smart mobility domain. We implement a simulation
framework where sensors are grouped by proximity into multiple cloudlets, each
handling a subgraph of the traffic graph, fetching node features from other
cloudlets to train its own local ST-GNN model, and exchanging model updates
with other cloudlets to ensure consistency, enhancing scalability and removing
reliance on a centralized aggregator. We perform extensive comparative
evaluation of four different ST-GNN training setups -- centralized, traditional
FL, server-free FL, and Gossip Learning -- on large-scale traffic datasets, the
METR-LA and PeMS-BAY datasets, for short-, mid-, and long-term vehicle speed
predictions. Experimental results show that semi-decentralized setups are
comparable to centralized approaches in performance metrics, while offering
advantages in terms of scalability and fault tolerance. In addition, we
highlight often overlooked issues in existing literature for distributed
ST-GNNs, such as the variation in model performance across different
geographical areas due to region-specific traffic patterns, and the significant
communication overhead and computational costs that arise from the large
receptive field of GNNs, leading to substantial data transfers and increased
computation of partial embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03188v1,,False
ChatTS: Aligning Time Series with LLMs via Synthetic Data for Enhanced Understanding and Reasoning,04/12/2024,"Zhe Xie, Zeyan Li, Xiao He, Longlong Xu, Xidao Wen, Tieying Zhang, Jianjun Chen, Rui Shi, Dan Pei","Understanding time series is crucial for its application in real-world
scenarios. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been increasingly
applied to time series tasks, leveraging their strong language capabilities to
enhance various applications. However, research on multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for
time series understanding and reasoning remains limited, primarily due to the
scarcity of high-quality datasets that align time series with textual
information. This paper introduces ChatTS, a novel MLLM designed for time
series analysis. ChatTS treats time series as a modality, similar to how vision
MLLMs process images, enabling it to perform both understanding and reasoning
with time series. To address the scarcity of training data, we propose an
attribute-based method for generating synthetic time series with detailed
attribute descriptions. We further introduce Time Series Evol-Instruct, a novel
approach that generates diverse time series Q&As, enhancing the model's
reasoning capabilities. To the best of our knowledge, ChatTS is the first MLLM
that takes multivariate time series as input, which is fine-tuned exclusively
on synthetic datasets. We evaluate its performance using benchmark datasets
with real-world data, including six alignment tasks and four reasoning tasks.
Our results show that ChatTS significantly outperforms existing vision-based
MLLMs (e.g., GPT-4o) and text/agent-based LLMs, achieving a 46.0% improvement
in alignment tasks and a 25.8% improvement in reasoning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03104v1,,False
UTSD: Unified Time Series Diffusion Model,04/12/2024,"Xiangkai Ma, Xiaobin Hong, Wenzhong Li, Sanglu Lu","Transformer-based architectures have achieved unprecedented success in time
series analysis. However, facing the challenge of across-domain modeling,
existing studies utilize statistical prior as prompt engineering fails under
the huge distribution shift among various domains. In this paper, a Unified
Time Series Diffusion (UTSD) model is established for the first time to model
the multi-domain probability distribution, utilizing the powerful probability
distribution modeling ability of Diffusion. Unlike the autoregressive models
that capture the conditional probabilities of the prediction horizon to the
historical sequence, we use a diffusion denoising process to model the mixture
distribution of the cross-domain data and generate the prediction sequence for
the target domain directly utilizing conditional sampling. The proposed UTSD
contains three pivotal designs: (1) The condition network captures the
multi-scale fluctuation patterns from the observation sequence, which are
utilized as context representations to guide the denoising network to generate
the prediction sequence; (2) Adapter-based fine-tuning strategy, the
multi-domain universal representation learned in the pretraining stage is
utilized for downstream tasks in target domains; (3) The diffusion and
denoising process on the actual sequence space, combined with the improved
classifier free guidance as the conditional generation strategy, greatly
improves the stability and accuracy of the downstream task. We conduct
extensive experiments on mainstream benchmarks, and the pre-trained UTSD
outperforms existing foundation models on all data domains, exhibiting superior
zero-shot generalization ability. After training from scratch, UTSD achieves
comparable performance against domain-specific proprietary models. The
empirical results validate the potential of UTSD as a time series foundational
model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.03068v1,,False
Panoptic Diffusion Models: co-generation of images and segmentation maps,04/12/2024,"Yinghan Long, Kaushik Roy","Recently, diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
text-guided and image-conditioned image generation. However, existing diffusion
models cannot simultaneously generate a segmentation map of objects and a
corresponding image from the prompt. Previous attempts either generate
segmentation maps based on the images or provide maps as input conditions to
control image generation, limiting their functionality to given inputs.
Incorporating an inherent understanding of the scene layouts can improve the
creativity and realism of diffusion models. To address this limitation, we
present Panoptic Diffusion Model (PDM), the first model designed to generate
both images and panoptic segmentation maps concurrently. PDM bridges the gap
between image and text by constructing segmentation layouts that provide
detailed, built-in guidance throughout the generation process. This ensures the
inclusion of categories mentioned in text prompts and enriches the diversity of
segments within the background. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PDM across
two architectures: a unified diffusion transformer and a two-stream transformer
with a pretrained backbone. To facilitate co-generation with fewer sampling
steps, we incorporate a fast diffusion solver into PDM. Additionally, when
ground-truth maps are available, PDM can function as a text-guided
image-to-image generation model. Finally, we propose a novel metric for
evaluating the quality of generated maps and show that PDM achieves
state-of-the-art results in image generation with implicit scene control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02929v1,,False
Higher Order Transformers: Efficient Attention Mechanism for Tensor Structured Data,04/12/2024,"Soroush Omranpour, Guillaume Rabusseau, Reihaneh Rabbany","Transformers are now ubiquitous for sequence modeling tasks, but their
extension to multi-dimensional data remains a challenge due to the quadratic
cost of the attention mechanism. In this paper, we propose Higher-Order
Transformers (HOT), a novel architecture designed to efficiently process data
with more than two axes, i.e. higher-order tensors. To address the
computational challenges associated with high-order tensor attention, we
introduce a novel Kronecker factorized attention mechanism that reduces the
attention cost to quadratic in each axis' dimension, rather than quadratic in
the total size of the input tensor. To further enhance efficiency, HOT
leverages kernelized attention, reducing the complexity to linear. This
strategy maintains the model's expressiveness while enabling scalable attention
computation. We validate the effectiveness of HOT on two high-dimensional
tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting, and 3D medical image
classification. Experimental results demonstrate that HOT achieves competitive
performance while significantly improving computational efficiency, showcasing
its potential for tackling a wide range of complex, multi-dimensional data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.02919v1,,False
