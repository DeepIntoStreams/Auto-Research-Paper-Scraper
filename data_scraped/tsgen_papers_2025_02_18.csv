Personality Structured Interview for Large Language Model Simulation in Personality Research,17/02/2025,"Pengda Wang, Huiqi Zou, Hanjie Chen, Tianjun Sun, Ziang Xiao, Frederick L. Oswald","Although psychometrics researchers have recently explored the use of large
language models (LLMs) as proxies for human participants, LLMs often fail to
generate heterogeneous data with human-like diversity, which diminishes their
value in advancing social science research. To address these challenges, we
explored the potential of the theory-informed Personality Structured Interview
(PSI) as a tool for simulating human responses in personality research. In this
approach, the simulation is grounded in nuanced real-human interview
transcripts that target the personality construct of interest. We have provided
a growing set of 357 structured interview transcripts from a representative
sample, each containing an individual's response to 32 open-ended questions
carefully designed to gather theory-based personality evidence. Additionally,
grounded in psychometric research, we have summarized an evaluation framework
to systematically validate LLM-generated psychometric data. Results from three
experiments demonstrate that well-designed structured interviews could improve
human-like heterogeneity in LLM-simulated personality data and predict
personality-related behavioral outcomes (i.e., organizational citizenship
behaviors and counterproductive work behavior). We further discuss the role of
theory-informed structured interviews in LLM-based simulation and outline a
general framework for designing structured interviews to simulate human-like
data for psychometric research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.12109v1,,False
Deep Spatio-Temporal Neural Network for Air Quality Reanalysis,17/02/2025,"Ammar Kheder, Benjamin Foreback, Lili Wang, Zhi-Song Liu, Michael Boy","Air quality prediction is key to mitigating health impacts and guiding
decisions, yet existing models tend to focus on temporal trends while
overlooking spatial generalization. We propose AQ-Net, a spatiotemporal
reanalysis model for both observed and unobserved stations in the near future.
AQ-Net utilizes the LSTM and multi-head attention for the temporal regression.
We also propose a cyclic encoding technique to ensure continuous time
representation. To learn fine-grained spatial air quality estimation, we
incorporate AQ-Net with the neural kNN to explore feature-based interpolation,
such that we can fill the spatial gaps given coarse observation stations. To
demonstrate the efficiency of our model for spatiotemporal reanalysis, we use
data from 2013-2017 collected in northern China for PM2.5 analysis. Extensive
experiments show that AQ-Net excels in air quality reanalysis, highlighting the
potential of hybrid spatio-temporal models to better capture environmental
dynamics, especially in urban areas where both spatial and temporal variability
are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11941v1,,False
VLP: Vision-Language Preference Learning for Embodied Manipulation,17/02/2025,"Runze Liu, Chenjia Bai, Jiafei Lyu, Shengjie Sun, Yali Du, Xiu Li","Reward engineering is one of the key challenges in Reinforcement Learning
(RL). Preference-based RL effectively addresses this issue by learning from
human feedback. However, it is both time-consuming and expensive to collect
human preference labels. In this paper, we propose a novel
\textbf{V}ision-\textbf{L}anguage \textbf{P}reference learning framework, named
\textbf{VLP}, which learns a vision-language preference model to provide
preference feedback for embodied manipulation tasks. To achieve this, we define
three types of language-conditioned preferences and construct a vision-language
preference dataset, which contains versatile implicit preference orders without
human annotations. The preference model learns to extract language-related
features, and then serves as a preference annotator in various downstream
tasks. The policy can be learned according to the annotated preferences via
reward learning or direct policy optimization. Extensive empirical results on
simulated embodied manipulation tasks demonstrate that our method provides
accurate preferences and generalizes to unseen tasks and unseen language
instructions, outperforming the baselines by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11918v1,,False
PreAdaptFWI: Pretrained-Based Adaptive Residual Learning for Full-Waveform Inversion Without Dataset Dependency,17/02/2025,"Xintong Dong, Zhengyi Yuan, Jun Lin, Shiqi Dong, Xunqian Tong, Yue Li","Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is a method that utilizes seismic data to
invert the physical parameters of subsurface media by minimizing the difference
between simulated and observed waveforms. Due to its ill-posed nature, FWI is
susceptible to getting trapped in local minima. Consequently, various research
efforts have attempted to combine neural networks with FWI to stabilize the
inversion process. This study presents a simple yet effective training
framework that is independent of dataset reliance and requires only moderate
pre-training on a simple initial model to stabilize network outputs. During the
transfer learning phase, the conventional FWI gradients will simultaneously
update both the neural network and the proposed adaptive residual learning
module, which learns the residual mapping of large-scale distribution features
in the network's output, rather than directly fitting the target mapping.
Through this synergistic training paradigm, the proposed algorithm effectively
infers the physically-informed prior knowledge into a global representation of
stratigraphic distribution, as well as capturing subtle variations in
inter-layer velocities within local details, thereby escaping local optima.
Evaluating the method on two benchmark models under various conditions,
including absent low-frequency data, noise interference, and differing initial
models, along with corresponding ablation experiments, consistently
demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11913v1,,False
Neural Guided Diffusion Bridges,17/02/2025,"Gefan Yang, Frank van der Meulen, Stefan Sommer","We propose a novel method for simulating conditioned diffusion processes
(diffusion bridges) in Euclidean spaces. By training a neural network to
approximate bridge dynamics, our approach eliminates the need for
computationally intensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods or
reverse-process modeling. Compared to existing methods, it offers greater
robustness across various diffusion specifications and conditioning scenarios.
This applies in particular to rare events and multimodal distributions, which
pose challenges for score-learning- and MCMC-based approaches. We propose a
flexible variational family for approximating the diffusion bridge path measure
which is partially specified by a neural network. Once trained, it enables
efficient independent sampling at a cost comparable to sampling the
unconditioned (forward) process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11909v1,,False
Enhanced Anomaly Detection in IoMT Networks using Ensemble AI Models on the CICIoMT2024 Dataset,17/02/2025,"Prathamesh Chandekar, Mansi Mehta, Swet Chandan","The rapid proliferation of Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) devices in
healthcare has introduced unique cybersecurity challenges, primarily due to the
diverse communication protocols and critical nature of these devices This
research aims to develop an advanced, real-time anomaly detection framework
tailored for IoMT network traffic, leveraging AI/ML models and the CICIoMT2024
dataset By integrating multi-protocol (MQTT, WiFi), attack-specific (DoS,
DDoS), time-series (active/idle states), and device-specific (Bluetooth) data,
our study captures a comprehensive range of IoMT interactions As part of our
data analysis, various machine learning techniques are employed which include
an ensemble model using XGBoost for improved performance against specific
attack types, sequential models comprised of LSTM and CNN-LSTM that leverage
time dependencies, and unsupervised models such as Autoencoders and Isolation

AAKT: Enhancing Knowledge Tracing with Alternate Autoregressive Modeling,17/02/2025,"Hao Zhou, Wenge Rong, Jianfei Zhang, Qing Sun, Yuanxin Ouyang, Zhang Xiong","Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict students' future performances based on
their former exercises and additional information in educational settings. KT
has received significant attention since it facilitates personalized
experiences in educational situations. Simultaneously, the autoregressive
modeling on the sequence of former exercises has been proven effective for this
task. One of the primary challenges in autoregressive modeling for Knowledge
Tracing is effectively representing the anterior (pre-response) and posterior
(post-response) states of learners across exercises. Existing methods often
employ complex model architectures to update learner states using question and
response records. In this study, we propose a novel perspective on knowledge
tracing task by treating it as a generative process, consistent with the
principles of autoregressive models. We demonstrate that knowledge states can
be directly represented through autoregressive encodings on a question-response
alternate sequence, where model generate the most probable representation in
hidden state space by analyzing history interactions. This approach underpins
our framework, termed Alternate Autoregressive Knowledge Tracing (AAKT).
Additionally, we incorporate supplementary educational information, such as
question-related skills, into our framework through an auxiliary task, and
include extra exercise details, like response time, as additional inputs. Our
proposed framework is implemented using advanced autoregressive technologies
from Natural Language Generation (NLG) for both training and prediction.
Empirical evaluations on four real-world KT datasets indicate that AAKT
consistently outperforms all baseline models in terms of AUC, ACC, and RMSE.
Furthermore, extensive ablation studies and visualized analysis validate the
effectiveness of key components in AAKT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11817v1,10.1109/TLT.2024.3521898,False
How does ion temperature gradient turbulence depend on magnetic geometry? Insights from data and machine learning,17/02/2025,"Matt Landreman, Jong Youl Choi, Caio Alves, Prasanna Balaprakash, R. Michael Churchill, Rory Conlin, Gareth Roberg-Clark","Magnetic geometry has a significant effect on the level of turbulent
transport in fusion plasmas. Here, we model and analyze this dependence using
multiple machine learning methods and a dataset of > 200,000 nonlinear
simulations of ion-temperature-gradient turbulence in diverse non-axisymmetric
geometries. The dataset is generated using a large collection of both optimized
and randomly generated stellarator equilibria. At fixed gradients, the
turbulent heat flux varies between geometries by several orders of magnitude.
Trends are apparent among the configurations with particularly high or low heat
flux. Regression and classification techniques from machine learning are then
applied to extract patterns in the dataset. Due to a symmetry of the
gyrokinetic equation, the heat flux and regressions thereof should be invariant
to translations of the raw features in the parallel coordinate, similar to
translation invariance in computer vision applications. Multiple regression
models including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and decision trees can
achieve reasonable predictive power for the heat flux in held-out test
configurations, with highest accuracy for the CNNs. Using Spearman correlation,
sequential feature selection, and Shapley values to measure feature importance,
it is consistently found that the most important geometric lever on the heat
flux is the flux surface compression in regions of bad curvature. The second
most important feature relates to the magnitude of geodesic curvature. These
two features align remarkably with surrogates that have been proposed based on
theory, while the methods here allow a natural extension to more features for
increased accuracy. The dataset, released with this publication, may also be
used to test other proposed surrogates, and we find many previously published
proxies do correlate well with both the heat flux and stability boundary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11657v1,,False
Competing LLM Agents in a Non-Cooperative Game of Opinion Polarisation,17/02/2025,"Amin Qasmi, Usman Naseem, Mehwish Nasim","We introduce a novel non-cooperative game to analyse opinion formation and
resistance, incorporating principles from social psychology such as
confirmation bias, resource constraints, and influence penalties. Our
simulation features Large Language Model (LLM) agents competing to influence a
population, with penalties imposed for generating messages that propagate or
counter misinformation. This framework integrates resource optimisation into
the agents' decision-making process. Our findings demonstrate that while higher
confirmation bias strengthens opinion alignment within groups, it also
exacerbates overall polarisation. Conversely, lower confirmation bias leads to
fragmented opinions and limited shifts in individual beliefs. Investing heavily
in a high-resource debunking strategy can initially align the population with
the debunking agent, but risks rapid resource depletion and diminished
long-term influence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11649v1,,False
A Unified Modeling Framework for Automated Penetration Testing,17/02/2025,"Yunfei Wang, Shixuan Liu, Wenhao Wang, Changling Zhou, Chao Zhang, Jiandong Jin, Cheng Zhu","The integration of artificial intelligence into automated penetration testing
(AutoPT) has highlighted the necessity of simulation modeling for the training
of intelligent agents, due to its cost-efficiency and swift feedback
capabilities. Despite the proliferation of AutoPT research, there is a
recognized gap in the availability of a unified framework for simulation
modeling methods. This paper presents a systematic review and synthesis of
existing techniques, introducing MDCPM to categorize studies based on
literature objectives, network simulation complexity, dependency of technical
and tactical operations, and scenario feedback and variation. To bridge the gap
in unified method for multi-dimensional and multi-level simulation modeling,
dynamic environment modeling, and the scarcity of public datasets, we introduce
AutoPT-Sim, a novel modeling framework that based on policy automation and
encompasses the combination of all sub dimensions. AutoPT-Sim offers a
comprehensive approach to modeling network environments, attackers, and
defenders, transcending the constraints of static modeling and accommodating
networks of diverse scales. We publicly release a generated standard network
environment dataset and the code of Network Generator. By integrating publicly
available datasets flexibly, support is offered for various simulation modeling
levels focused on policy automation in MDCPM and the network generator help
researchers output customized target network data by adjusting parameters or
fine-tuning the network generator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11588v1,,False
Calibration of Vehicular Traffic Simulation Models by Local Optimization,17/02/2025,"Davide Andrea Guastella, Alejandro Morales-Hernàndez, Bruno Cornelis, Gianluca Bontempi","Simulation is a valuable tool for traffic management experts to assist them
in refining and improving transportation systems and anticipating the impact of
possible changes in the infrastructure network before their actual
implementation. Calibrating simulation models using traffic count data is
challenging because of the complexity of the environment, the lack of data, and
the uncertainties in traffic dynamics. This paper introduces a novel stochastic
simulation-based traffic calibration technique. The novelty of the proposed
method is: (i) it performs local traffic calibration, (ii) it allows
calibrating simulated traffic in large-scale environments, (iii) it requires
only the traffic count data. The local approach enables decentralizing the
calibration task to reach near real-time performance, enabling the fostering of
digital twins. Using only traffic count data makes the proposed method generic
so that it can be applied in different traffic scenarios at various scales
(from neighborhood to region). We assess the proposed technique on a model of
Brussels, Belgium, using data from real traffic monitoring devices. The
proposed method has been implemented using the open-source traffic simulator
SUMO. Experimental results show that the traffic model calibrated using the
proposed method is on average 16% more accurate than those obtained by the
state-of-the-art methods, using the same dataset. We also make available the
output traffic model obtained from real data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11585v1,10.1007/s11116-025-10593-x,False
Continuous Diffusion Model for Language Modeling,17/02/2025,"Jaehyeong Jo, Sung Ju Hwang","Diffusion models have emerged as a promising alternative to autoregressive
models in modeling discrete categorical data. Yet diffusion models that
directly work on discrete data space do not fully exploit the power of
iterative refinement, as the signals are lost during the transition between
discrete states. Existing continuous diffusion models for discrete data have
limited performance compared to discrete approaches, and the unclear link
between them restricts the development of diffusion models for discrete data.
In this work, we propose a continuous diffusion model for language modeling
that incorporates the geometry of the underlying categorical distribution. We
establish a connection between the discrete diffusion and continuous flow on
the statistical manifold, and building on the analogy, we introduce a simple
design for the diffusion process that generalizes previous discrete diffusion
models. We further propose a simulation-free training framework based on radial
symmetry and a simple technique to address the high dimensionality of the
manifold. Comprehensive experiments on language modeling benchmarks and other
modalities show that our method outperforms existing discrete diffusion models
and approaches the performance of autoregressive models. Codes available at

Planning of Heuristics: Strategic Planning on Large Language Models with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Automating Heuristic Optimization,17/02/2025,"Chaoxu Mu, Xufeng Zhang, Hui Wang","Heuristics have achieved great success in solv- ing combinatorial
optimization problems (COPs). However, heuristics designed by humans re- quire
too much domain knowledge and testing time. Given the fact that Large Language
Mod- els (LLMs) possess strong capabilities to under- stand and generate
content, and a knowledge base that covers various domains, which offer a novel
way to automatically optimize heuristics. There- fore, we propose Planning of
Heuristics (PoH), an optimization method that integrates the self- reflection
of LLMs with the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a well-known planning algo-
rithm. PoH iteratively refines generated heuristics by evaluating their
performance and providing im- provement suggestions. Our method enables to it-
eratively evaluate the generated heuristics (states) and improve them based on
the improvement sug- gestions (actions) and evaluation results (rewards), by
effectively simulating future states to search for paths with higher rewards.
In this paper, we apply PoH to solve the Traveling Salesman Prob- lem (TSP) and
the Flow Shop Scheduling Prob- lem (FSSP). The experimental results show that
PoH outperforms other hand-crafted heuristics and Automatic Heuristic Design
(AHD) by other LLMs-based methods, and achieves the signifi- cant improvements

heuristic optimization with LLMs to solve COPs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11422v1,,False
"TimeCAP: Learning to Contextualize, Augment, and Predict Time Series Events with Large Language Model Agents",17/02/2025,"Geon Lee, Wenchao Yu, Kijung Shin, Wei Cheng, Haifeng Chen","Time series data is essential in various applications, including climate
modeling, healthcare monitoring, and financial analytics. Understanding the
contextual information associated with real-world time series data is often
essential for accurate and reliable event predictions. In this paper, we
introduce TimeCAP, a time-series processing framework that creatively employs
Large Language Models (LLMs) as contextualizers of time series data, extending
their typical usage as predictors. TimeCAP incorporates two independent LLM
agents: one generates a textual summary capturing the context of the time
series, while the other uses this enriched summary to make more informed
predictions. In addition, TimeCAP employs a multi-modal encoder that synergizes
with the LLM agents, enhancing predictive performance through mutual
augmentation of inputs with in-context examples. Experimental results on
real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeCAP outperforms state-of-the-art
methods for time series event prediction, including those utilizing LLMs as
predictors, achieving an average improvement of 28.75% in F1 score.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11418v1,,False
DiSCo: Device-Server Collaborative LLM-Based Text Streaming Services,17/02/2025,"Ting Sun, Penghan Wang, Fan Lai","The rapid rise of large language models (LLMs) in text streaming services has
introduced significant cost and Quality of Experience (QoE) challenges in
serving millions of daily requests, especially in meeting Time-To-First-Token
(TTFT) and Time-Between-Token (TBT) requirements for real-time interactions.
Our real-world measurements show that both server-based and on-device
deployments struggle to meet diverse QoE demands: server deployments face high
costs and last-hop issues (e.g., Internet latency and dynamics), while
on-device LLM inference is constrained by resources.
  We introduce DiSCo, a device-server cooperative scheduler designed to
optimize users' QoE by adaptively routing requests and migrating response
generation between endpoints while maintaining cost constraints. DiSCo employs
cost-aware scheduling, leveraging the predictable speed of on-device LLM
inference with the flexible capacity of server-based inference to dispatch
requests on the fly, while introducing a token-level migration mechanism to
ensure consistent token delivery during migration. Evaluations on real-world
workloads -- including commercial services like OpenAI GPT and DeepSeek, and
open-source deployments such as LLaMA3 -- show that DiSCo can improve users'
QoE by reducing tail TTFT (11-52\%) and mean TTFT (6-78\%) across different
model-device configurations, while dramatically reducing serving costs by up to
84\% through its migration mechanism while maintaining comparable QoE levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11417v1,,False
Robot Deformable Object Manipulation via NMPC-generated Demonstrations in Deep Reinforcement Learning,17/02/2025,"Haoyuan Wang, Zihao Dong, Hongliang Lei, Zejia Zhang, Weizhuang Shi, Wei Luo, Weiwei Wan, Jian Huang","In this work, we conducted research on deformable object manipulation by
robots based on demonstration-enhanced reinforcement learning (RL). To improve
the learning efficiency of RL, we enhanced the utilization of demonstration
data from multiple aspects and proposed the HGCR-DDPG algorithm. It uses a
novel high-dimensional fuzzy approach for grasping-point selection, a refined
behavior-cloning method to enhance data-driven learning in Rainbow-DDPG, and a
sequential policy-learning strategy. Compared to the baseline algorithm
(Rainbow-DDPG), our proposed HGCR-DDPG achieved 2.01 times the global average
reward and reduced the global average standard deviation to 45% of that of the
baseline algorithm. To reduce the human labor cost of demonstration collection,
we proposed a low-cost demonstration collection method based on Nonlinear Model
Predictive Control (NMPC). Simulation experiment results show that
demonstrations collected through NMPC can be used to train HGCR-DDPG, achieving
comparable results to those obtained with human demonstrations. To validate the
feasibility of our proposed methods in real-world environments, we conducted
physical experiments involving deformable object manipulation. We manipulated
fabric to perform three tasks: diagonal folding, central axis folding, and
flattening. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method
achieved success rates of 83.3%, 80%, and 100% for these three tasks,
respectively, validating the effectiveness of our approach. Compared to current
large-model approaches for robot manipulation, the proposed algorithm is
lightweight, requires fewer computational resources, and offers task-specific
customization and efficient adaptability for specific tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11375v1,,False
A Framework for Learning Scoring Rules in Autonomous Driving Planning Systems,17/02/2025,"Zikang Xiong, Joe Kurian Eappen, Suresh Jagannathan","In autonomous driving systems, motion planning is commonly implemented as a
two-stage process: first, a trajectory proposer generates multiple candidate
trajectories, then a scoring mechanism selects the most suitable trajectory for
execution. For this critical selection stage, rule-based scoring mechanisms are
particularly appealing as they can explicitly encode driving preferences,
safety constraints, and traffic regulations in a formalized,
human-understandable format. However, manually crafting these scoring rules
presents significant challenges: the rules often contain complex
interdependencies, require careful parameter tuning, and may not fully capture
the nuances present in real-world driving data. This work introduces FLoRA, a
novel framework that bridges this gap by learning interpretable scoring rules
represented in temporal logic. Our method features a learnable logic structure
that captures nuanced relationships across diverse driving scenarios,
optimizing both rules and parameters directly from real-world driving
demonstrations collected in NuPlan. Our approach effectively learns to evaluate
driving behavior even though the training data only contains positive examples
(successful driving demonstrations). Evaluations in closed-loop planning
simulations demonstrate that our learned scoring rules outperform existing
techniques, including expert-designed rules and neural network scoring models,
while maintaining interpretability. This work introduces a data-driven approach
to enhance the scoring mechanism in autonomous driving systems, designed as a
plug-in module to seamlessly integrate with various trajectory proposers. Our

S2TX: Cross-Attention Multi-Scale State-Space Transformer for Time Series Forecasting,17/02/2025,"Zihao Wu, Juncheng Dong, Haoming Yang, Vahid Tarokh","Time series forecasting has recently achieved significant progress with
multi-scale models to address the heterogeneity between long and short range
patterns. Despite their state-of-the-art performance, we identify two potential
areas for improvement. First, the variates of the multivariate time series are
processed independently. Moreover, the multi-scale (long and short range)
representations are learned separately by two independent models without
communication. In light of these concerns, we propose State Space Transformer
with cross-attention (S2TX). S2TX employs a cross-attention mechanism to
integrate a Mamba model for extracting long-range cross-variate context and a
Transformer model with local window attention to capture short-range
representations. By cross-attending to the global context, the Transformer
model further facilitates variate-level interactions as well as local/global
communications. Comprehensive experiments on seven classic long-short range
time-series forecasting benchmark datasets demonstrate that S2TX can achieve
highly robust SOTA results while maintaining a low memory footprint.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11340v1,,False
Inverse Flow and Consistency Models,17/02/2025,"Yuchen Zhang, Jian Zhou","Inverse generation problems, such as denoising without ground truth
observations, is a critical challenge in many scientific inquiries and
real-world applications. While recent advances in generative models like
diffusion models, conditional flow matching, and consistency models achieved
impressive results by casting generation as denoising problems, they cannot be
directly used for inverse generation without access to clean data. Here we
introduce Inverse Flow (IF), a novel framework that enables using these
generative models for inverse generation problems including denoising without
ground truth. Inverse Flow can be flexibly applied to nearly any continuous
noise distribution and allows complex dependencies. We propose two algorithms
for learning Inverse Flows, Inverse Flow Matching (IFM) and Inverse Consistency
Model (ICM). Notably, to derive the computationally efficient, simulation-free
inverse consistency model objective, we generalized consistency training to any
forward diffusion processes or conditional flows, which have applications
beyond denoising. We demonstrate the effectiveness of IF on synthetic and real
datasets, outperforming prior approaches while enabling noise distributions
that previous methods cannot support. Finally, we showcase applications of our
techniques to fluorescence microscopy and single-cell genomics data,
highlighting IF's utility in scientific problems. Overall, this work expands
