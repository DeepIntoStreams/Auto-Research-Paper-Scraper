VibeVoice Technical Report,26/08/2025,"Zhiliang Peng, Jianwei Yu, Wenhui Wang, Yaoyao Chang, Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Yi Zhu, Weijiang Xu, Hangbo Bao, Zehua Wang, Shaohan Huang, Yan Xia, Furu Wei","This report presents VibeVoice, a novel model designed to synthesize
long-form speech with multiple speakers by employing next-token diffusion,
which is a unified method for modeling continuous data by autoregressively
generating latent vectors via diffusion. To enable this, we introduce a novel
continuous speech tokenizer that, when compared to the popular Encodec model,
improves data compression by 80 times while maintaining comparable performance.
The tokenizer effectively preserves audio fidelity while significantly boosting
computational efficiency for processing long sequences. Thus, VibeVoice can
synthesize long-form speech for up to 90 minutes (in a 64K context window
length) with a maximum of 4 speakers, capturing the authentic conversational
``vibe'' and surpassing open-source and proprietary dialogue models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19205v1,,False
Attackers Strike Back? Not Anymore -- An Ensemble of RL Defenders Awakens for APT Detection,26/08/2025,"Sidahmed Benabderrahmane, Talal Rahwan","Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) represent a growing menace to modern
digital infrastructure. Unlike traditional cyberattacks, APTs are stealthy,
adaptive, and long-lasting, often bypassing signature-based detection systems.
This paper introduces a novel framework for APT detection that unites deep
learning, reinforcement learning (RL), and active learning into a cohesive,
adaptive defense system. Our system combines auto-encoders for latent
behavioral encoding with a multi-agent ensemble of RL-based defenders, each
trained to distinguish between benign and malicious process behaviors. We
identify a critical challenge in existing detection systems: their static
nature and inability to adapt to evolving attack strategies. To this end, our
architecture includes multiple RL agents (Q-Learning, PPO, DQN, adversarial
defenders), each analyzing latent vectors generated by an auto-encoder. When
any agent is uncertain about its decision, the system triggers an active
learning loop to simulate expert feedback, thus refining decision boundaries.
An ensemble voting mechanism, weighted by each agent's performance, ensures
robust final predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19072v1,,False
Automated discovery of finite volume schemes using Graph Neural Networks,26/08/2025,"Paul Garnier, Jonathan Viquerat, Elie Hachem","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19052v1,,False
STDiff: A State Transition Diffusion Framework for Time Series Imputation in Industrial Systems,26/08/2025,"Gary Simethy, Daniel Ortiz-Arroyo, Petar Durdevic","Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19011v1,,False
Building Self-Evolving Agents via Experience-Driven Lifelong Learning: A Framework and Benchmark,26/08/2025,"Yuxuan Cai, Yipeng Hao, Jie Zhou, Hang Yan, Zhikai Lei, Rui Zhen, Zhenhua Han, Yutao Yang, Junsong Li, Qianjun Pan, Tianyu Huai, Qin Chen, Xin Li, Kai Chen, Bo Zhang, Xipeng Qiu, Liang He","As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as ""second nature"".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19005v1,,False
PAX-TS: Model-agnostic multi-granular explanations for time series forecasting via localized perturbations,26/08/2025,"Tim Kreuzer, Jelena Zdravkovic, Panagiotis Papapetrou","Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18982v1,,False
STARec: An Efficient Agent Framework for Recommender Systems via Autonomous Deliberate Reasoning,26/08/2025,"Chenghao Wu, Ruiyang Ren, Junjie Zhang, Ruirui Wang, Zhongrui Ma, Qi Ye, Wayne Xin Zhao","While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18812v1,10.1145/3746252.3760995,False
Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator for Temperature-Dependent Anisotropic Plasticity in HCP Materials,26/08/2025,"Yannick Hollenweger, Dennis M. Kochman, Burigede Liu","Neural network surrogate models for constitutive laws in computational
mechanics have been in use for some time. In plasticity, these models often
rely on gated recurrent units (GRUs) or long short-term memory (LSTM) cells,
which excel at capturing path-dependent phenomena. However, they suffer from
long training times and time-resolution-dependent predictions that extrapolate
poorly. Moreover, most existing surrogates for macro- or mesoscopic plasticity
handle only relatively simple material behavior. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce the Temperature-Aware Recurrent Neural Operator (TRNO), a
time-resolution-independent neural architecture. We apply the TRNO to model the
temperature-dependent plastic response of polycrystalline magnesium, which
shows strong plastic anisotropy and thermal sensitivity. The TRNO achieves high
predictive accuracy and generalizes effectively across diverse loading cases,
temperatures, and time resolutions. It also outperforms conventional GRU and
LSTM models in training efficiency and predictive performance. Finally, we
demonstrate multiscale simulations with the TRNO, yielding a speedup of at
least three orders of magnitude over traditional constitutive models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18806v1,,False
Governance-as-a-Service: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI System Compliance and Policy Enforcement,26/08/2025,"Helen Pervez, Suyash Gaurav, Jukka Heikkonen, Jatin Chaudhary","As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18765v1,,False
ROSE: Remove Objects with Side Effects in Videos,26/08/2025,"Chenxuan Miao, Yutong Feng, Jianshu Zeng, Zixiang Gao, Hantang Liu, Yunfeng Yan, Donglian Qi, Xi Chen, Bin Wang, Hengshuang Zhao","Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

Uncertainty Awareness on Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Time Series Data,26/08/2025,"Weide Liu, Xiaoyang Zhong, Lu Wang, Jingwen Hou, Yuemei Luo, Jiebin Yan, Yuming Fang","Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18630v1,,False
History Rhymes: Accelerating LLM Reinforcement Learning with RhymeRL,26/08/2025,"Jingkai He, Tianjian Li, Erhu Feng, Dong Du, Qian Liu, Tao Liu, Yubin Xia, Haibo Chen","With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18588v1,,False
