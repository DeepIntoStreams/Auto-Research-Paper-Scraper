Trading Graph Neural Network,10/04/2025,Xian Wu,"This paper proposes a new algorithm -- Trading Graph Neural Network (TGNN)
that can structurally estimate the impact of asset features, dealer features
and relationship features on asset prices in trading networks. It combines the
strength of the traditional simulated method of moments (SMM) and recent
machine learning techniques -- Graph Neural Network (GNN). It outperforms
existing reduced-form methods with network centrality measures in prediction
accuracy. The method can be used on networks with any structure, allowing for
heterogeneity among both traders and assets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07923v1,,False
Semantically Encoding Activity Labels for Context-Aware Human Activity Recognition,10/04/2025,"Wen Ge, Guanyi Mou, Emmanuel O. Agu, Kyumin Lee","Prior work has primarily formulated CA-HAR as a multi-label classification
problem, where model inputs are time-series sensor data and target labels are
binary encodings representing whether a given activity or context occurs. These
CA-HAR methods either predicted each label independently or manually imposed
relationships using graphs. However, both strategies often neglect an essential
aspect: activity labels have rich semantic relationships. For instance,
walking, jogging, and running activities share similar movement patterns but
differ in pace and intensity, indicating that they are semantically related.
Consequently, prior CA-HAR methods often struggled to accurately capture these
inherent and nuanced relationships, particularly on datasets with noisy labels
typically used for CA-HAR or situations where the ideal sensor type is
unavailable (e.g., recognizing speech without audio sensors). To address this
limitation, we propose SEAL, which leverage LMs to encode CA-HAR activity
labels to capture semantic relationships. LMs generate vector embeddings that
preserve rich semantic information from natural language. Our SEAL approach
encodes input-time series sensor data from smart devices and their associated
activity and context labels (text) as vector embeddings. During training, SEAL
aligns the sensor data representations with their corresponding
activity/context label embeddings in a shared embedding space. At inference
time, SEAL performs a similarity search, returning the CA-HAR label with the
embedding representation closest to the input data. Although LMs have been
widely explored in other domains, surprisingly, their potential in CA-HAR has
been underexplored, making our approach a novel contribution to the field. Our
research opens up new possibilities for integrating more advanced LMs into
CA-HAR tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07916v1,,False
DiverseFlow: Sample-Efficient Diverse Mode Coverage in Flows,10/04/2025,"Mashrur M. Morshed, Vishnu Boddeti","Many real-world applications of flow-based generative models desire a diverse
set of samples that cover multiple modes of the target distribution. However,
the predominant approach for obtaining diverse sets is not sample-efficient, as
it involves independently obtaining many samples from the source distribution
and mapping them through the flow until the desired mode coverage is achieved.
As an alternative to repeated sampling, we introduce DiverseFlow: a
training-free approach to improve the diversity of flow models. Our key idea is
to employ a determinantal point process to induce a coupling between the
samples that drives diversity under a fixed sampling budget. In essence,
DiverseFlow allows exploration of more variations in a learned flow model with
fewer samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for tasks where
sample-efficient diversity is desirable, such as text-guided image generation
with polysemous words, inverse problems like large-hole inpainting, and
class-conditional image synthesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07894v1,,False
SpecReason: Fast and Accurate Inference-Time Compute via Speculative Reasoning,10/04/2025,"Rui Pan, Yinwei Dai, Zhihao Zhang, Gabriele Oliaro, Zhihao Jia, Ravi Netravali","Recent advances in inference-time compute have significantly improved
performance on complex tasks by generating long chains of thought (CoTs) using
Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). However, this improved accuracy comes at the
cost of high inference latency due to the length of generated reasoning
sequences and the autoregressive nature of decoding. Our key insight in
tackling these overheads is that LRM inference, and the reasoning that it
embeds, is highly tolerant of approximations: complex tasks are typically
broken down into simpler steps, each of which brings utility based on the
semantic insight it provides for downstream steps rather than the exact tokens
it generates. Accordingly, we introduce SpecReason, a system that automatically
accelerates LRM inference by using a lightweight model to (speculatively) carry
out simpler intermediate reasoning steps and reserving the costly base model
only to assess (and potentially correct) the speculated outputs. Importantly,
SpecReason's focus on exploiting the semantic flexibility of thinking tokens in
preserving final-answer accuracy is complementary to prior speculation
techniques, most notably speculative decoding, which demands token-level
equivalence at each step. Across a variety of reasoning benchmarks, SpecReason
achieves 1.5-2.5$\times$ speedup over vanilla LRM inference while improving
accuracy by 1.0-9.9\%. Compared to speculative decoding without SpecReason,
their combination yields an additional 19.4-44.2\% latency reduction. We
open-source SpecReason at https://github.com/ruipeterpan/specreason.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07891v1,,False
Robust Hallucination Detection in LLMs via Adaptive Token Selection,10/04/2025,"Mengjia Niu, Hamed Haddadi, Guansong Pang","Hallucinations in large language models (LLMs) pose significant safety
concerns that impede their broader deployment. Recent research in hallucination
detection has demonstrated that LLMs' internal representations contain
truthfulness hints, which can be harnessed for detector training. However, the
performance of these detectors is heavily dependent on the internal
representations of predetermined tokens, fluctuating considerably when working
on free-form generations with varying lengths and sparse distributions of
hallucinated entities. To address this, we propose HaMI, a novel approach that
enables robust detection of hallucinations through adaptive selection and
learning of critical tokens that are most indicative of hallucinations. We
achieve this robustness by an innovative formulation of the Hallucination
detection task as Multiple Instance (HaMI) learning over token-level
representations within a sequence, thereby facilitating a joint optimisation of
token selection and hallucination detection on generation sequences of diverse
forms. Comprehensive experimental results on four hallucination benchmarks show
that HaMI significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07863v1,,False
MOSAIC: Modeling Social AI for Content Dissemination and Regulation in Multi-Agent Simulations,10/04/2025,"Genglin Liu, Salman Rahman, Elisa Kreiss, Marzyeh Ghassemi, Saadia Gabriel","We present a novel, open-source social network simulation framework, MOSAIC,
where generative language agents predict user behaviors such as liking,
sharing, and flagging content. This simulation combines LLM agents with a
directed social graph to analyze emergent deception behaviors and gain a better
understanding of how users determine the veracity of online social content. By
constructing user representations from diverse fine-grained personas, our
system enables multi-agent simulations that model content dissemination and
engagement dynamics at scale. Within this framework, we evaluate three
different content moderation strategies with simulated misinformation
dissemination, and we find that they not only mitigate the spread of
non-factual content but also increase user engagement. In addition, we analyze
the trajectories of popular content in our simulations, and explore whether
simulation agents' articulated reasoning for their social interactions truly
aligns with their collective engagement patterns. We open-source our simulation
software to encourage further research within AI and social sciences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07830v1,,False
A Novel Deep Learning Approach for Emulating Computationally Expensive Postfire Debris Flows,10/04/2025,"Palak Patel, Luke McGuire, Abani Patra","Traditional physics-based models of geophysical flows, such as debris flows
and landslides that pose significant risks to human lives and infrastructure
are computationally expensive, limiting their utility for large-scale parameter
sweeps, uncertainty quantification, inversions or real-time applications. This
study presents an efficient alternative, a deep learning-based surrogate model
built using a modified U-Net architecture to predict the dynamics of
runoff-generated debris flows across diverse terrain based on data from physics
based simulations. The study area is divided into smaller patches for localized
predictions using a patch-predict-stitch methodology (complemented by limited
global data to accelerate training). The patches are then combined to
reconstruct spatially continuous flow maps, ensuring scalability for large
domains. To enable fast training using limited expensive simulations, the deep
learning model was trained on data from an ensemble of physics based
simulations using parameters generated via Latin Hypercube Sampling and
validated on unseen parameter sets and terrain, achieving maximum pointwise
errors below 10% and robust generalization. Uncertainty quantification using
Monte Carlo methods are enabled using the validated surrogate, which can
facilitate probabilistic hazard assessments. This study highlights the
potential of deep learning surrogates as powerful tools for geophysical flow
analysis, enabling computationally efficient and reliable probabilistic hazard
map predictions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07736v1,,False
Merging Embedded Topics with Optimal Transport for Online Topic Modeling on Data Streams,10/04/2025,"Federica Granese, Benjamin Navet, Serena Villata, Charles Bouveyron","Topic modeling is a key component in unsupervised learning, employed to
identify topics within a corpus of textual data. The rapid growth of social
media generates an ever-growing volume of textual data daily, making online
topic modeling methods essential for managing these data streams that
continuously arrive over time. This paper introduces a novel approach to online
topic modeling named StreamETM. This approach builds on the Embedded Topic
Model (ETM) to handle data streams by merging models learned on consecutive
partial document batches using unbalanced optimal transport. Additionally, an
online change point detection algorithm is employed to identify shifts in
topics over time, enabling the identification of significant changes in the
dynamics of text streams. Numerical experiments on simulated and real-world
data show StreamETM outperforming competitors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07711v1,,False
Distilling Knowledge from Heterogeneous Architectures for Semantic Segmentation,10/04/2025,"Yanglin Huang, Kai Hu, Yuan Zhang, Zhineng Chen, Xieping Gao","Current knowledge distillation (KD) methods for semantic segmentation focus
on guiding the student to imitate the teacher's knowledge within homogeneous
architectures. However, these methods overlook the diverse knowledge contained
in architectures with different inductive biases, which is crucial for enabling
the student to acquire a more precise and comprehensive understanding of the
data during distillation. To this end, we propose for the first time a generic
knowledge distillation method for semantic segmentation from a heterogeneous
perspective, named HeteroAKD. Due to the substantial disparities between
heterogeneous architectures, such as CNN and Transformer, directly transferring
cross-architecture knowledge presents significant challenges. To eliminate the
influence of architecture-specific information, the intermediate features of
both the teacher and student are skillfully projected into an aligned logits
space. Furthermore, to utilize diverse knowledge from heterogeneous
architectures and deliver customized knowledge required by the student, a
teacher-student knowledge mixing mechanism (KMM) and a teacher-student
knowledge evaluation mechanism (KEM) are introduced. These mechanisms are
performed by assessing the reliability and its discrepancy between
heterogeneous teacher-student knowledge. Extensive experiments conducted on
three main-stream benchmarks using various teacher-student pairs demonstrate
that our HeteroAKD outperforms state-of-the-art KD methods in facilitating
distillation between heterogeneous architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07691v1,,False
Synthesizing High-Quality Programming Tasks with LLM-based Expert and Student Agents,10/04/2025,"Manh Hung Nguyen, Victor-Alexandru Pădurean, Alkis Gotovos, Sebastian Tschiatschek, Adish Singla","Generative AI is transforming computing education by enabling the automatic
generation of personalized content and feedback. We investigate its
capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite
promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between
AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align
with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to
solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works
often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address
these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that
first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain
quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process
into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using
both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show
that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline
techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our
validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly
available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality
programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload
and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in
online resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07655v1,,False
ms-Mamba: Multi-scale Mamba for Time-Series Forecasting,10/04/2025,"Yusuf Meric Karadag, Sinan Kalkan, Ipek Gursel Dino","The problem of Time-series Forecasting is generally addressed by recurrent,
Transformer-based and the recently proposed Mamba-based architectures. However,
existing architectures generally process their input at a single temporal
scale, which may be sub-optimal for many tasks where information changes over
multiple time scales. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture called
Multi-scale Mamba (ms-Mamba) to address this gap. ms-Mamba incorporates
multiple temporal scales by using multiple Mamba blocks with different sampling
rates ($\Delta$s). Our experiments on many benchmarks demonstrate that ms-Mamba
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, including the recently proposed
Transformer-based and Mamba-based models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07654v1,,False
Beating Transformers using Synthetic Cognition,10/04/2025,"Alfredo Ibias, Miguel Rodriguez-Galindo, Hector Antona, Guillem Ramirez-Miranda, Enric Guinovart","The road to Artificial General Intelligence goes through the generation of
episodic reactive behaviors, where the Transformer architecture has been proven
to be the state-of-the-art. However, they still fail to develop reasoning.
Recently, a novel approach for developing cognitive architectures, called
Synthetic Cognition, has been proposed and implemented to develop instantaneous
reactive behavior. In this study, we aim to explore the use of Synthetic
Cognition to develop episodic reactive behaviors. We propose a mechanism to
deal with sequences for the recent implementation of Synthetic Cognition, and
test it against DNA foundation models in DNA sequence classification tasks. In
our experiments, our proposal clearly outperforms the DNA foundation models,
obtaining the best score on more benchmark tasks than the alternatives. Thus,
we achieve two goals: expanding Synthetic Cognition to deal with sequences, and
beating the Transformer architecture for sequence classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07619v1,,False
Diffusion Transformers for Tabular Data Time Series Generation,10/04/2025,"Fabrizio Garuti, Enver Sangineto, Simone Luetto, Lorenzo Forni, Rita Cucchiara","Tabular data generation has recently attracted a growing interest due to its
different application scenarios. However, generating time series of tabular
data, where each element of the series depends on the others, remains a largely
unexplored domain. This gap is probably due to the difficulty of jointly
solving different problems, the main of which are the heterogeneity of tabular
data (a problem common to non-time-dependent approaches) and the variable
length of a time series. In this paper, we propose a Diffusion Transformers
(DiTs) based approach for tabular data series generation. Inspired by the
recent success of DiTs in image and video generation, we extend this framework
to deal with heterogeneous data and variable-length sequences. Using extensive
experiments on six datasets, we show that the proposed approach outperforms
previous work by a large margin.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07566v1,,False
ClimateBench-M: A Multi-Modal Climate Data Benchmark with a Simple Generative Method,10/04/2025,"Dongqi Fu, Yada Zhu, Zhining Liu, Lecheng Zheng, Xiao Lin, Zihao Li, Liri Fang, Katherine Tieu, Onkar Bhardwaj, Kommy Weldemariam, Hanghang Tong, Hendrik Hamann, Jingrui He","Climate science studies the structure and dynamics of Earth's climate system
and seeks to understand how climate changes over time, where the data is
usually stored in the format of time series, recording the climate features,
geolocation, time attributes, etc. Recently, much research attention has been
paid to the climate benchmarks. In addition to the most common task of weather
forecasting, several pioneering benchmark works are proposed for extending the
modality, such as domain-specific applications like tropical cyclone intensity
prediction and flash flood damage estimation, or climate statement and
confidence level in the format of natural language. To further motivate the
artificial general intelligence development for climate science, in this paper,
we first contribute a multi-modal climate benchmark, i.e., ClimateBench-M,
which aligns (1) the time series climate data from ERA5, (2) extreme weather
events data from NOAA, and (3) satellite image data from NASA HLS based on a
unified spatial-temporal granularity. Second, under each data modality, we also
propose a simple but strong generative method that could produce competitive
