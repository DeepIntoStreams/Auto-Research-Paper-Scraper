A Comparative Study of Deep Reinforcement Learning for Crop Production Management,06/11/2024,"Joseph Balderas, Dong Chen, Yanbo Huang, Li Wang, Ren-Cang Li","Crop production management is essential for optimizing yield and minimizing a
field's environmental impact to crop fields, yet it remains challenging due to
the complex and stochastic processes involved. Recently, researchers have
turned to machine learning to address these complexities. Specifically,
reinforcement learning (RL), a cutting-edge approach designed to learn optimal
decision-making strategies through trial and error in dynamic environments, has
emerged as a promising tool for developing adaptive crop management policies.
RL models aim to optimize long-term rewards by continuously interacting with
the environment, making them well-suited for tackling the uncertainties and
variability inherent in crop management. Studies have shown that RL can
generate crop management policies that compete with, and even outperform,
expert-designed policies within simulation-based crop models. In the gym-DSSAT
crop model environment, one of the most widely used simulators for crop
management, proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep Q-networks (DQN) have
shown promising results. However, these methods have not yet been
systematically evaluated under identical conditions. In this study, we
evaluated PPO and DQN against static baseline policies across three different
RL tasks, fertilization, irrigation, and mixed management, provided by the
gym-DSSAT environment. To ensure a fair comparison, we used consistent default
parameters, identical reward functions, and the same environment settings. Our
results indicate that PPO outperforms DQN in fertilization and irrigation
tasks, while DQN excels in the mixed management task. This comparative analysis
provides critical insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach,
advancing the development of more effective RL-based crop management
strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.04106v1,,False
Towards Resource-Efficient Federated Learning in Industrial IoT for Multivariate Time Series Analysis,06/11/2024,"Alexandros Gkillas, Aris Lalos","Anomaly and missing data constitute a thorny problem in industrial
applications. In recent years, deep learning enabled anomaly detection has
emerged as a critical direction, however the improved detection accuracy is
achieved with the utilization of large neural networks, increasing their
storage and computational cost. Moreover, the data collected in edge devices
contain user privacy, introducing challenges that can be successfully addressed
by the privacy-preserving distributed paradigm, known as federated learning
(FL). This framework allows edge devices to train and exchange models
increasing also the communication cost. Thus, to deal with the increased
communication, processing and storage challenges of the FL based deep anomaly
detection NN pruning is expected to have significant benefits towards reducing
the processing, storage and communication complexity. With this focus, a novel
compression-based optimization problem is proposed at the server-side of a FL
paradigm that fusses the received local models broadcast and performs pruning
generating a more compressed model. Experiments in the context of anomaly
detection and missing value imputation demonstrate that the proposed FL
scenario along with the proposed compressed-based method are able to achieve
high compression rates (more than $99.7\%$) with negligible performance losses
(less than $1.18\%$ ) as compared to the centralized solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03996v1,,False
ET-SEED: Efficient Trajectory-Level SE(3) Equivariant Diffusion Policy,06/11/2024,"Chenrui Tie, Yue Chen, Ruihai Wu, Boxuan Dong, Zeyi Li, Chongkai Gao, Hao Dong","Imitation learning, e.g., diffusion policy, has been proven effective in
various robotic manipulation tasks. However, extensive demonstrations are
required for policy robustness and generalization. To reduce the demonstration
reliance, we leverage spatial symmetry and propose ET-SEED, an efficient
trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion model for generating action
sequences in complex robot manipulation tasks. Further, previous equivariant
diffusion models require the per-step equivariance in the Markov process,
making it difficult to learn policy under such strong constraints. We
theoretically extend equivariant Markov kernels and simplify the condition of
equivariant diffusion process, thereby significantly improving training
efficiency for trajectory-level SE(3) equivariant diffusion policy in an
end-to-end manner. We evaluate ET-SEED on representative robotic manipulation
tasks, involving rigid body, articulated and deformable object. Experiments
demonstrate superior data efficiency and manipulation proficiency of our
proposed method, as well as its ability to generalize to unseen configurations
with only a few demonstrations. Website: https://et-seed.github.io/",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03990v1,,False
Can Custom Models Learn In-Context? An Exploration of Hybrid Architecture Performance on In-Context Learning Tasks,06/11/2024,"Ryan Campbell, Nelson Lojo, Kesava Viswanadha, Christoffer Grondal Tryggestad, Derrick Han Sun, Sriteja Vijapurapu, August Rolfsen, Anant Sahai","In-Context Learning (ICL) is a phenomenon where task learning occurs through
a prompt sequence without the necessity of parameter updates. ICL in
Multi-Headed Attention (MHA) with absolute positional embedding has been the
focus of more study than other sequence model varieties. We examine
implications of architectural differences between GPT-2 and LLaMa as well as
LlaMa and Mamba. We extend work done by Garg et al. (2022) and Park et al.
(2024) to GPT-2/LLaMa hybrid and LLaMa/Mamba hybrid models - examining the
interplay between sequence transformation blocks and regressive performance
in-context. We note that certain architectural changes cause degraded training
efficiency/ICL accuracy by converging to suboptimal predictors or converging
slower. We also find certain hybrids showing optimistic performance
improvements, informing potential future ICL-focused architecture
modifications. Additionally, we propose the ""ICL regression score"", a scalar
metric describing a model's whole performance on a specific task. Compute
limitations impose restrictions on our architecture-space, training duration,
number of training runs, function class complexity, and benchmark complexity.
To foster reproducible and extensible research, we provide a typed, modular,
and extensible Python package on which we run all experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03945v1,,False
Game-Theoretic Machine Unlearning: Mitigating Extra Privacy Leakage,06/11/2024,"Hengzhu Liu, Tianqing Zhu, Lefeng Zhang, Ping Xiong","With the extensive use of machine learning technologies, data providers
encounter increasing privacy risks. Recent legislation, such as GDPR, obligates
organizations to remove requested data and its influence from a trained model.
Machine unlearning is an emerging technique designed to enable machine learning
models to erase users' private information. Although several efficient machine
unlearning schemes have been proposed, these methods still have limitations.
First, removing the contributions of partial data may lead to model performance
degradation. Second, discrepancies between the original and generated unlearned
models can be exploited by attackers to obtain target sample's information,
resulting in additional privacy leakage risks. To address above challenges, we
proposed a game-theoretic machine unlearning algorithm that simulates the
competitive relationship between unlearning performance and privacy protection.
This algorithm comprises unlearning and privacy modules. The unlearning module
possesses a loss function composed of model distance and classification error,
which is used to derive the optimal strategy. The privacy module aims to make
it difficult for an attacker to infer membership information from the unlearned
data, thereby reducing the privacy leakage risk during the unlearning process.
Additionally, the experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that
this game-theoretic unlearning algorithm's effectiveness and its ability to
generate an unlearned model with a performance similar to that of the retrained
one while mitigating extra privacy leakage risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03914v1,,False
Retentive Neural Quantum States: Efficient Ansätze for Ab Initio Quantum Chemistry,06/11/2024,"Oliver Knitter, Dan Zhao, James Stokes, Martin Ganahl, Stefan Leichenauer, Shravan Veerapaneni","Neural-network quantum states (NQS) has emerged as a powerful application of
quantum-inspired deep learning for variational Monte Carlo methods, offering a
competitive alternative to existing techniques for identifying ground states of
quantum problems. A significant advancement toward improving the practical
scalability of NQS has been the incorporation of autoregressive models, most
recently transformers, as variational ansatze. Transformers learn sequence
information with greater expressiveness than recurrent models, but at the cost
of increased time complexity with respect to sequence length. We explore the
use of the retentive network (RetNet), a recurrent alternative to transformers,
as an ansatz for solving electronic ground state problems in $\textit{ab
initio}$ quantum chemistry. Unlike transformers, RetNets overcome this time
complexity bottleneck by processing data in parallel during training, and
recurrently during inference. We give a simple computational cost estimate of
the RetNet and directly compare it with similar estimates for transformers,
establishing a clear threshold ratio of problem-to-model size past which the
RetNet's time complexity outperforms that of the transformer. Though this
efficiency can comes at the expense of decreased expressiveness relative to the
transformer, we overcome this gap through training strategies that leverage the
autoregressive structure of the model -- namely, variational neural annealing.
Our findings support the RetNet as a means of improving the time complexity of
NQS without sacrificing accuracy. We provide further evidence that the ablative
improvements of neural annealing extend beyond the RetNet architecture,
suggesting it would serve as an effective general training strategy for
autoregressive NQS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03900v1,,False
Large Generative Model-assisted Talking-face Semantic Communication System,06/11/2024,"Feibo Jiang, Siwei Tu, Li Dong, Cunhua Pan, Jiangzhou Wang, Xiaohu You","The rapid development of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) continually
unveils the potential of Semantic Communication (SemCom). However, current
talking-face SemCom systems still encounter challenges such as low bandwidth
utilization, semantic ambiguity, and diminished Quality of Experience (QoE).
This study introduces a Large Generative Model-assisted Talking-face Semantic
Communication (LGM-TSC) System tailored for the talking-face video
communication. Firstly, we introduce a Generative Semantic Extractor (GSE) at
the transmitter based on the FunASR model to convert semantically sparse
talking-face videos into texts with high information density. Secondly, we
establish a private Knowledge Base (KB) based on the Large Language Model (LLM)
for semantic disambiguation and correction, complemented by a joint knowledge
base-semantic-channel coding scheme. Finally, at the receiver, we propose a
Generative Semantic Reconstructor (GSR) that utilizes BERT-VITS2 and SadTalker
models to transform text back into a high-QoE talking-face video matching the
user's timbre. Simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness
of the proposed LGM-TSC system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03876v1,,False
Flexible task abstractions emerge in linear networks with fast and bounded units,06/11/2024,"Kai Sandbrink, Jan P. Bauer, Alexandra M. Proca, Andrew M. Saxe, Christopher Summerfield, Ali Hummos","Animals survive in dynamic environments changing at arbitrary timescales, but
such data distribution shifts are a challenge to neural networks. To adapt to
change, neural systems may change a large number of parameters, which is a slow
process involving forgetting past information. In contrast, animals leverage
distribution changes to segment their stream of experience into tasks and
associate them with internal task abstracts. Animals can then respond flexibly
by selecting the appropriate task abstraction. However, how such flexible task
abstractions may arise in neural systems remains unknown. Here, we analyze a
linear gated network where the weights and gates are jointly optimized via
gradient descent, but with neuron-like constraints on the gates including a
faster timescale, nonnegativity, and bounded activity. We observe that the
weights self-organize into modules specialized for tasks or sub-tasks
encountered, while the gates layer forms unique representations that switch the
appropriate weight modules (task abstractions). We analytically reduce the
learning dynamics to an effective eigenspace, revealing a virtuous cycle: fast
adapting gates drive weight specialization by protecting previous knowledge,
while weight specialization in turn increases the update rate of the gating
layer. Task switching in the gating layer accelerates as a function of
curriculum block size and task training, mirroring key findings in cognitive
neuroscience. We show that the discovered task abstractions support
generalization through both task and subtask composition, and we extend our
findings to a non-linear network switching between two tasks. Overall, our work
offers a theory of cognitive flexibility in animals as arising from joint
gradient descent on synaptic and neural gating in a neural network
architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03840v1,,False
Automating Exploratory Proteomics Research via Language Models,06/11/2024,"Ning Ding, Shang Qu, Linhai Xie, Yifei Li, Zaoqu Liu, Kaiyan Zhang, Yibai Xiong, Yuxin Zuo, Zhangren Chen, Ermo Hua, Xingtai Lv, Youbang Sun, Yang Li, Dong Li, Fuchu He, Bowen Zhou","With the development of artificial intelligence, its contribution to science
is evolving from simulating a complex problem to automating entire research
processes and producing novel discoveries. Achieving this advancement requires
both specialized general models grounded in real-world scientific data and
iterative, exploratory frameworks that mirror human scientific methodologies.
In this paper, we present PROTEUS, a fully automated system for scientific
discovery from raw proteomics data. PROTEUS uses large language models (LLMs)
to perform hierarchical planning, execute specialized bioinformatics tools, and
iteratively refine analysis workflows to generate high-quality scientific
hypotheses. The system takes proteomics datasets as input and produces a
comprehensive set of research objectives, analysis results, and novel
biological hypotheses without human intervention. We evaluated PROTEUS on 12
proteomics datasets collected from various biological samples (e.g. immune
cells, tumors) and different sample types (single-cell and bulk), generating
191 scientific hypotheses. These were assessed using both automatic LLM-based
scoring on 5 metrics and detailed reviews from human experts. Results
demonstrate that PROTEUS consistently produces reliable, logically coherent
results that align well with existing literature while also proposing novel,
evaluable hypotheses. The system's flexible architecture facilitates seamless
integration of diverse analysis tools and adaptation to different proteomics
data types. By automating complex proteomics analysis workflows and hypothesis
generation, PROTEUS has the potential to considerably accelerate the pace of
scientific discovery in proteomics research, enabling researchers to
efficiently explore large-scale datasets and uncover biological insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03743v1,,False
Towards 3D Semantic Scene Completion for Autonomous Driving: A Meta-Learning Framework Empowered by Deformable Large-Kernel Attention and Mamba Model,06/11/2024,"Yansong Qu, Zilin Huang, Zihao Sheng, Tiantian Chen, Sikai Chen","Semantic scene completion (SSC) is essential for achieving comprehensive
perception in autonomous driving systems. However, existing SSC methods often
overlook the high deployment costs in real-world applications. Traditional
architectures, such as 3D Convolutional Neural Networks (3D CNNs) and
self-attention mechanisms, face challenges in efficiently capturing long-range
dependencies within 3D voxel grids, limiting their effectiveness. To address
these issues, we introduce MetaSSC, a novel meta-learning-based framework for
SSC that leverages deformable convolution, large-kernel attention, and the
Mamba (D-LKA-M) model. Our approach begins with a voxel-based semantic
segmentation (SS) pretraining task, aimed at exploring the semantics and
geometry of incomplete regions while acquiring transferable meta-knowledge.
Using simulated cooperative perception datasets, we supervise the perception
training of a single vehicle using aggregated sensor data from multiple nearby
connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), generating richer and more comprehensive
labels. This meta-knowledge is then adapted to the target domain through a
dual-phase training strategy that does not add extra model parameters, enabling
efficient deployment. To further enhance the model's capability in capturing
long-sequence relationships within 3D voxel grids, we integrate Mamba blocks
with deformable convolution and large-kernel attention into the backbone
network. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaSSC achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming competing models
while also reducing deployment costs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03672v1,,False
A Subsampling Based Neural Network for Spatial Data,06/11/2024,Debjoy Thakur,"The application of deep neural networks in geospatial data has become a
trending research problem in the present day. A significant amount of
statistical research has already been introduced, such as generalized least
square optimization by incorporating spatial variance-covariance matrix,
considering basis functions in the input nodes of the neural networks, and so
on. However, for lattice data, there is no available literature about the
utilization of asymptotic analysis of neural networks in regression for spatial
data. This article proposes a consistent localized two-layer deep neural
network-based regression for spatial data. We have proved the consistency of
this deep neural network for bounded and unbounded spatial domains under a
fixed sampling design of mixed-increasing spatial regions. We have proved that
its asymptotic convergence rate is faster than that of \cite{zhan2024neural}'s
neural network and an improved generalization of \cite{shen2023asymptotic}'s
neural network structure. We empirically observe the rate of convergence of
discrepancy measures between the empirical probability distribution of observed
and predicted data, which will become faster for a less smooth spatial surface.
We have applied our asymptotic analysis of deep neural networks to the
estimation of the monthly average temperature of major cities in the USA from
its satellite image. This application is an effective showcase of non-linear
spatial regression. We demonstrate our methodology with simulated lattice data
in various scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03620v1,,False
Open-Source High-Speed Flight Surrogate Modeling Framework,06/11/2024,"Tyler E. Korenyi-Both, Nathan J. Falkiewicz, Matthew C. Jones","High-speed flight vehicles, which travel much faster than the speed of sound,
are crucial for national defense and space exploration. However, accurately
predicting their behavior under numerous, varied flight conditions is a
challenge and often prohibitively expensive. The proposed approach involves
creating smarter, more efficient machine learning models (also known as
surrogate models or meta models) that can fuse data generated from a variety of
fidelity levels -- to include engineering methods, simulation, wind tunnel, and
flight test data -- to make more accurate predictions. These models are able to
move the bulk of the computation from high performance computing (HPC) to
single user machines (laptop, desktop, etc.). The project builds upon previous
work but introduces code improvements and an informed perspective on the
direction of the field. The new surrogate modeling framework is now modular
and, by design, broadly applicable to many modeling problems. The new framework
also has a more robust automatic hyperparameter tuning capability and abstracts
away most of the pre- and post-processing tasks. The Gaussian process
regression and deep neural network-based models included in the presented
framework were able to model two datasets with high accuracy (R^2>0.99). The
primary conclusion is that the framework is effective and has been delivered to
the Air Force for integration into real-world projects. For future work,
significant and immediate investment in continued research is crucial. The
author recommends further testing and refining modeling methods that explicitly
incorporate physical laws and are robust enough to handle simulation and test
data from varying resolutions and sources, including coarse meshes, fine
meshes, unstructured meshes, and limited experimental test points.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03598v1,,False
An Experimental Study on Decomposition-Based Deep Ensemble Learning for Traffic Flow Forecasting,06/11/2024,"Qiyuan Zhu, A. K. Qin, Hussein Dia, Adriana-Simona Mihaita, Hanna Grzybowska","Traffic flow forecasting is a crucial task in intelligent transport systems.
Deep learning offers an effective solution, capturing complex patterns in
time-series traffic flow data to enable the accurate prediction. However, deep
learning models are prone to overfitting the intricate details of flow data,
leading to poor generalisation. Recent studies suggest that decomposition-based
deep ensemble learning methods may address this issue by breaking down a time
series into multiple simpler signals, upon which deep learning models are built
and ensembled to generate the final prediction. However, few studies have
compared the performance of decomposition-based ensemble methods with
non-decomposition-based ones which directly utilise raw time-series data. This
work compares several decomposition-based and non-decomposition-based deep
ensemble learning methods. Experimental results on three traffic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of decomposition-based ensemble methods, while also
revealing their sensitivity to aggregation strategies and forecasting horizons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03588v1,,False
