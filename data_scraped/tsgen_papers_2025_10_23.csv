Memo: Training Memory-Efficient Embodied Agents with Reinforcement Learning,22/10/2025,"Gunshi Gupta, Karmesh Yadav, Zsolt Kira, Yarin Gal, Rahaf Aljundi","To enable embodied agents to operate effectively over extended timeframes, it
is crucial to develop models that form and access memories to stay
contextualized in their environment. In the current paradigm of training
transformer-based policies for embodied sequential decision-making tasks,
visual inputs often overwhelm the context limits of transformers, while humans
can maintain and utilize a lifetime of experience compressed as memories.
Significant compression is possible in principle, as much of the input is
irrelevant and can be abstracted. However, existing approaches predominantly
focus on either recurrent models with fixed-size memory or transformers with
full-context reliance. In this work, we propose Memo, a transformer-based
architecture and training recipe for reinforcement learning (RL) on
memory-intensive, long-horizon tasks. Memo incorporates the creation and
retrieval of memory by interleaving periodic summarization tokens with the
inputs of a model during training. We demonstrate Memo's effectiveness on a
gridworld meta-RL benchmark and a multi-object navigation task in
photo-realistic indoor settings. Memo outperforms naive long-context
transformer baselines while being more compute and storage efficient.
Additionally, Memo generalizes better to longer contexts at inference time and
remains robust in streaming settings, where historical context must be
truncated to fit inference constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19732v1,,False
Enabling Granular Subgroup Level Model Evaluations by Generating Synthetic Medical Time Series,22/10/2025,"Mahmoud Ibrahim, Bart Elen, Chang Sun, Gökhan Ertaylan, Michel Dumontier","We present a novel framework for leveraging synthetic ICU time-series data
not only to train but also to rigorously and trustworthily evaluate predictive
models, both at the population level and within fine-grained demographic
subgroups. Building on prior diffusion and VAE-based generators (TimeDiff,
HealthGen, TimeAutoDiff), we introduce \textit{Enhanced TimeAutoDiff}, which
augments the latent diffusion objective with distribution-alignment penalties.
We extensively benchmark all models on MIMIC-III and eICU, on 24-hour mortality
and binary length-of-stay tasks. Our results show that Enhanced TimeAutoDiff
reduces the gap between real-on-synthetic and real-on-real evaluation (``TRTS
gap'') by over 70\%, achieving $\Delta_{TRTS} \leq 0.014$ AUROC, while
preserving training utility ($\Delta_{TSTR} \approx 0.01$). Crucially, for 32
intersectional subgroups, large synthetic cohorts cut subgroup-level AUROC
estimation error by up to 50\% relative to small real test sets, and outperform
them in 72--84\% of subgroups. This work provides a practical,
privacy-preserving roadmap for trustworthy, granular model evaluation in
critical care, enabling robust and reliable performance analysis across diverse
patient populations without exposing sensitive EHR data, contributing to the
overall trustworthiness of Medical AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19728v1,,False
SEMPO: Lightweight Foundation Models for Time Series Forecasting,22/10/2025,"Hui He, Kun Yi, Yuanchi Ma, Qi Zhang, Zhendong Niu, Guansong Pang","The recent boom of large pre-trained models witnesses remarkable success in
developing foundation models (FMs) for time series forecasting. Despite
impressive performance across diverse downstream forecasting tasks, existing
time series FMs possess massive network architectures and require substantial
pre-training on large-scale datasets, which significantly hinders their
deployment in resource-constrained environments. In response to this growing
tension between versatility and affordability, we propose SEMPO, a novel
lightweight foundation model that requires pretraining on relatively
small-scale data, yet exhibits strong general time series forecasting.
Concretely, SEMPO comprises two key modules: 1) energy-aware SpEctral
decomposition module, that substantially improves the utilization of
pre-training data by modeling not only the high-energy frequency signals but
also the low-energy yet informative frequency signals that are ignored in
current methods; and 2) Mixture-of-PrOmpts enabled Transformer, that learns
heterogeneous temporal patterns through small dataset-specific prompts and
adaptively routes time series tokens to prompt-based experts for
parameter-efficient model adaptation across different datasets and domains.
Equipped with these modules, SEMPO significantly reduces both pre-training data
scale and model size, while achieving strong generalization. Extensive
experiments on two large-scale benchmarks covering 16 datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of SEMPO in both zero-shot and few-shot forecasting
scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. Code and data are available
at https://github.com/mala-lab/SEMPO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19710v1,,False
From Forecasting to Planning: Policy World Model for Collaborative State-Action Prediction,22/10/2025,"Zhida Zhao, Talas Fu, Yifan Wang, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu","Despite remarkable progress in driving world models, their potential for
autonomous systems remains largely untapped: the world models are mostly
learned for world simulation and decoupled from trajectory planning. While
recent efforts aim to unify world modeling and planning in a single framework,
the synergistic facilitation mechanism of world modeling for planning still
requires further exploration. In this work, we introduce a new driving paradigm
named Policy World Model (PWM), which not only integrates world modeling and
trajectory planning within a unified architecture, but is also able to benefit
planning using the learned world knowledge through the proposed action-free
future state forecasting scheme. Through collaborative state-action prediction,
PWM can mimic the human-like anticipatory perception, yielding more reliable
planning performance. To facilitate the efficiency of video forecasting, we
further introduce a dynamically enhanced parallel token generation mechanism,
equipped with a context-guided tokenizer and an adaptive dynamic focal loss.
Despite utilizing only front camera input, our method matches or exceeds
state-of-the-art approaches that rely on multi-view and multi-modal inputs.

Learning and Simulating Building Evacuation Patterns for Enhanced Safety Design Using Generative Models,22/10/2025,"Jin Han, Zhe Zheng, Yi Gu, Jia-Rui Lin, Xin-Zheng Lu","Evacuation simulation is essential for building safety design, ensuring
properly planned evacuation routes. However, traditional evacuation simulation
relies heavily on refined modeling with extensive parameters, making it
challenging to adopt such methods in a rapid iteration process in early design
stages. Thus, this study proposes DiffEvac, a novel method to learn building
evacuation patterns based on Generative Models (GMs), for efficient evacuation
simulation and enhanced safety design. Initially, a dataset of 399 diverse
functional layouts and corresponding evacuation heatmaps of buildings was
established. Then, a decoupled feature representation is proposed to embed
physical features like layouts and occupant density for GMs. Finally, a
diffusion model based on image prompts is proposed to learn evacuation patterns
from simulated evacuation heatmaps. Compared to existing research using
Conditional GANs with RGB representation, DiffEvac achieves up to a 37.6%
improvement in SSIM, 142% in PSNR, and delivers results 16 times faster,
thereby cutting simulation time to 2 minutes. Case studies further demonstrate
that the proposed method not only significantly enhances the rapid design
iteration and adjustment process with efficient evacuation simulation but also
offers new insights and technical pathways for future safety optimization in
intelligent building design. The research implication is that the approach
lowers the modeling burden, enables large-scale what-if exploration, and
facilitates coupling with multi-objective design tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19623v1,,False
A Climate-Aware Deep Learning Framework for Generalizable Epidemic Forecasting,22/10/2025,"Jinpyo Hong, Rachel E. Baker","Precise outbreak forecasting of infectious diseases is essential for
effective public health responses and epidemic control. The increased
availability of machine learning (ML) methods for time-series forecasting
presents an enticing avenue to enhance outbreak forecasting. Though the
COVID-19 outbreak demonstrated the value of applying ML models to predict
epidemic profiles, using ML models to forecast endemic diseases remains
underexplored. In this work, we present ForecastNet-XCL (an ensemble model
based on XGBoost+CNN+BiLSTM), a deep learning hybrid framework designed to
addresses this gap by creating accurate multi-week RSV forecasts up to 100
weeks in advance based on climate and temporal data, without access to
real-time surveillance on RSV. The framework combines high-resolution feature
learning with long-range temporal dependency capturing mechanisms, bolstered by
an autoregressive module trained on climate-controlled lagged relations.
Stochastic inference returns probabilistic intervals to inform decision-making.
Evaluated across 34 U.S. states, ForecastNet-XCL reliably outperformed
statistical baselines, individual neural nets, and conventional ensemble
methods in both within- and cross-state scenarios, sustaining accuracy over
extended forecast horizons. Training on climatologically diverse datasets
enhanced generalization furthermore, particularly in locations having irregular
or biennial RSV patterns. ForecastNet-XCL's efficiency, performance, and
uncertainty-aware design make it a deployable early-warning tool amid
escalating climate pressures and constrained surveillance resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19611v1,,False
From Prototypes to Sparse ECG Explanations: SHAP-Driven Counterfactuals for Multivariate Time-Series Multi-class Classification,22/10/2025,"Maciej Mozolewski, Betül Bayrak, Kerstin Bach, Grzegorz J. Nalepa","In eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI), instance-based explanations for
time series have gained increasing attention due to their potential for
actionable and interpretable insights in domains such as healthcare. Addressing
the challenges of explainability of state-of-the-art models, we propose a
prototype-driven framework for generating sparse counterfactual explanations
tailored to 12-lead ECG classification models. Our method employs SHAP-based
thresholds to identify critical signal segments and convert them into interval
rules, uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and medoid clustering to extract
representative prototypes, and aligns these prototypes to query R-peaks for
coherence with the sample being explained. The framework generates
counterfactuals that modify only 78% of the original signal while maintaining
81.3% validity across all classes and achieving 43% improvement in temporal
stability. We evaluate three variants of our approach, Original, Sparse, and
Aligned Sparse, with class-specific performance ranging from 98.9% validity for
myocardial infarction (MI) to challenges with hypertrophy (HYP) detection
(13.2%). This approach supports near realtime generation (< 1 second) of
clinically valid counterfactuals and provides a foundation for interactive
explanation platforms. Our findings establish design principles for
physiologically-aware counterfactual explanations in AI-based diagnosis systems
and outline pathways toward user-controlled explanation interfaces for clinical
deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19514v1,,False
Modeling realistic human behavior using generative agents in a multimodal transport system: Software architecture and Application to Toulouse,22/10/2025,"Trung-Dung Vu, Benoit Gaudou, Kamaldeep Singh Oberoi","Modeling realistic human behaviour to understand people's mode choices in
order to propose personalised mobility solutions remains challenging. This
paper presents an architecture for modeling realistic human mobility behavior
in complex multimodal transport systems, demonstrated through a case study in
Toulouse, France. We apply Large Language Models (LLMs) within an agent-based
simulation to capture decision-making in a real urban setting. The framework
integrates the GAMA simulation platform with an LLM-based generative agent,
along with General Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) data for public transport,
and OpenTripPlanner for multimodal routing. GAMA platform models the
interactive transport environment, providing visualization and dynamic agent
interactions while eliminating the need to construct the simulation environment
from scratch. This design enables a stronger focus on developing generative
agents and evaluating their performance in transport decision-making processes.
Over a simulated month, results show that agents not only make context-aware
transport decisions but also form habits over time. We conclude that combining
LLMs with agent-based simulation offers a promising direction for advancing
intelligent transportation systems and personalised multimodal mobility
solutions. We also discuss some limitations of this approach and outline future
work on scaling to larger regions, integrating real-time data, and refining
memory models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19497v1,,False
HybridEP: Scaling Expert Parallelism to Cross-Datacenter Scenario via Hybrid Expert/Data Transmission,22/10/2025,"Weihao Yang, Hao Huang, Donglei Wu, Ningke Li, Yanqi Pan, Qiyang Zheng, Wen Xia, Shiyi Li, Qiang Wang","Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a popular architecture for scaling large
models. However, the rapidly growing scale outpaces model training on a single
DC, driving a shift toward a more flexible, cross-DC training paradigm. Under
this, Expert Parallelism (EP) of MoE faces significant scalability issues due
to the limited cross-DC bandwidth. Specifically, existing EP optimizations
attempt to overlap data communication and computation, which has little benefit
in low-bandwidth scenarios due to a much longer data communication time.
Therefore, the trends of cross-DC EP scaling is fast becoming a critical
roadblock to the continued growth of MoE models.
  To address this, we propose HybridEP, a modeling-guided framework to optimize
EP under constrained bandwidth. Our key idea is to dynamically transform the
spatial placement of experts to reduce data communication traffic and
frequency, thereby minimizing EP's communication overheads. However, it is
non-trivial to find the optimal solution because it complicates the original
communication pattern by mixing data and expert communication. We therefore
build a stream-based model to determine the optimal transmission ratio. Guided
by this, we incorporate two techniques: (1) domain-based partition to construct
the mapping between hybrid patterns and specific communication topology at GPU
level, and (2) parameter-efficient migration to further refine this topology by
reducing expert transmission overhead and enlarging the domain size. Combining
all these designs, HybridEP can be considered as a more general EP with better
scalability. Experimental results show that HybridEP outperforms existing
state-of-the-art MoE training systems by up to 5.6x under constrained
bandwidth. We further compare HybridEP and EP on large-scale simulations.
HybridEP achieves up to 1.45x speedup with 1k DCs under different bandwidths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19470v1,,False
LLM Unlearning with LLM Beliefs,22/10/2025,"Kemou Li, Qizhou Wang, Yue Wang, Fengpeng Li, Jun Liu, Bo Han, Jiantao Zhou","Large language models trained on vast corpora inherently risk memorizing
sensitive or harmful content, which may later resurface in their outputs.
Prevailing unlearning methods generally rely on gradient ascent and its
variants to lower the probability of specific target responses. However, we
find that this strategy induces a critical side effect: probability mass is
redistributed into high-likelihood regions, often corresponding to semantically
related rephrasings of the targets. We refer to this as the squeezing effect,
which explains why many methods yield merely spurious unlearning, a problem
further obscured by automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE, truth ratio) that misreport
actual success. To address this, we propose a bootstrapping (BS) framework that
explicitly links the squeezing effect with the model's own high-confidence
generations, namely its model beliefs. Since model beliefs inherently capture
the very high-likelihood regions where probability mass is squeezed,
incorporating them into the unlearning objective directly counters the
squeezing effect. By jointly suppressing both target responses and model
beliefs, BS-T (token) attenuates high-probability tokens, whereas BS-S
(sequence) removes entire high-confidence generations, together achieving more
thorough forgetting while preserving utility. Extensive experiments across
diverse benchmarks with various model families confirm the effectiveness of our
approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19422v1,,False
LMFD: Latent Monotonic Feature Discovery,22/10/2025,"Guus Toussaint, Arno Knobbe","Many systems in our world age, degrade or otherwise move slowly but steadily
in a certain direction. When monitoring such systems by means of sensors, one
often assumes that some form of `age' is latently present in the data, but
perhaps the available sensors do not readily provide this useful information.
The task that we study in this paper is to extract potential proxies for this
`age' from the available multi-variate time series without having clear data on
what `age' actually is. We argue that when we find a sensor, or more likely
some discovered function of the available sensors, that is sufficiently
monotonic, that function can act as the proxy we are searching for. Using a
carefully defined grammar and optimising the resulting equations in terms of
monotonicity, defined as the absolute Spearman's Rank Correlation between time
and the candidate formula, the proposed approach generates a set of candidate
features which are then fitted and assessed on monotonicity. The proposed
system is evaluated against an artificially generated dataset and two
real-world datasets. In all experiments, we show that the system is able to
combine sensors with low individual monotonicity into latent features with high
monotonicity. For the real-world dataset of InfraWatch, a structural health
monitoring project, we show that two features with individual absolute
Spearman's $\rho$ values of $0.13$ and $0.09$ can be combined into a proxy with
an absolute Spearman's $\rho$ of $0.95$. This demonstrates that our proposed
method can find interpretable equations which can serve as a proxy for the
`age' of the system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19383v1,10.1007/978-3-031-74633-8_2,False
Using Temperature Sampling to Effectively Train Robot Learning Policies on Imbalanced Datasets,22/10/2025,"Basavasagar Patil, Sydney Belt, Jayjun Lee, Nima Fazeli, Bernadette Bucher","Increasingly large datasets of robot actions and sensory observations are
being collected to train ever-larger neural networks. These datasets are
collected based on tasks and while these tasks may be distinct in their
descriptions, many involve very similar physical action sequences (e.g., 'pick
up an apple' versus 'pick up an orange'). As a result, many datasets of robotic
tasks are substantially imbalanced in terms of the physical robotic actions
they represent. In this work, we propose a simple sampling strategy for policy
training that mitigates this imbalance. Our method requires only a few lines of
code to integrate into existing codebases and improves generalization. We
evaluate our method in both pre-training small models and fine-tuning large
foundational models. Our results show substantial improvements on low-resource
tasks compared to prior state-of-the-art methods, without degrading performance
on high-resource tasks. This enables more effective use of model capacity for
multi-task policies. We also further validate our approach in a real-world
setup on a Franka Panda robot arm across a diverse set of tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19373v1,,False
Topology of Currencies: Persistent Homology for FX Co-movements: A Comparative Clustering Study,22/10/2025,"Pattravadee de Favereau de Jeneret, Ioannis Diamantis","This study investigates whether Topological Data Analysis (TDA) can provide
additional insights beyond traditional statistical methods in clustering
currency behaviours. We focus on the foreign exchange (FX) market, which is a
complex system often exhibiting non-linear and high-dimensional dynamics that
classical techniques may not fully capture. We compare clustering results based
on TDA-derived features versus classical statistical features using monthly
logarithmic returns of 13 major currency exchange rates (all against the euro).
Two widely-used clustering algorithms, \(k\)-means and Hierarchical clustering,
are applied on both types of features, and cluster quality is evaluated via the
Silhouette score and the Calinski-Harabasz index. Our findings show that
TDA-based feature clustering produces more compact and well-separated clusters
than clustering on traditional statistical features, particularly achieving
substantially higher Calinski-Harabasz scores. However, all clustering
approaches yield modest Silhouette scores, underscoring the inherent difficulty
of grouping FX time series. The differing cluster compositions under TDA vs.
classical features suggest that TDA captures structural patterns in currency
co-movements that conventional methods might overlook. These results highlight
TDA as a valuable complementary tool for analysing financial time series, with
potential applications in risk management where understanding structural
co-movements is crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19306v1,,False

Data Efficient Any Transformer-to-Mamba Distillation via Attention Bridge,22/10/2025,"Penghao Wang, Yuhao Zhou, Mengxuan Wu, Panpan Zhang, Zhangyang Wang, Kai Wang","State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to
Transformers for sequence modeling, offering superior scalability through
recurrent structures. However, their training remains costly and the ecosystem
around them is far less mature than that of Transformers. Moreover, the
structural heterogeneity between SSMs and Transformers makes it challenging to
efficiently distill knowledge from pretrained attention models. In this work,
we propose Cross-architecture distillation via Attention Bridge (CAB), a novel
data-efficient distillation framework that efficiently transfers attention
knowledge from Transformer teachers to state-space student models. Unlike
conventional knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge only at the output
level, CAB enables token-level supervision via a lightweight bridge and
flexible layer-wise alignment, improving both efficiency and transferability.
We further introduce flexible layer-wise alignment strategies to accommodate
architectural discrepancies between teacher and student. Extensive experiments
across vision and language domains demonstrate that our method consistently
improves the performance of state-space models, even under limited training
data, outperforming both standard and cross-architecture distillation methods.
Our findings suggest that attention-based knowledge can be efficiently
transferred to recurrent models, enabling rapid utilization of Transformer

behavior. Prior work has improved action prediction by applying SFT on action
traces with LLM-generated rationales, and by leveraging RL to further enhance
reasoning capabilities. Despite these advances, current approaches rely on
text-based inputs and overlook the essential role of visual perception in
shaping human decision-making during web GUI interactions. In this paper, we
investigate the integration of visual information, specifically webpage
screenshots, into behavior simulation via VLMs, leveraging OPeRA dataset. By
grounding agent decision-making in both textual and visual modalities, we aim
to narrow the gap between synthetic agents and real-world users, thereby
enabling more cognitively aligned simulations of online shopping behavior.
Specifically, we employ SFT for joint action prediction and rationale
generation, conditioning on the full interaction context, which comprises
action history, past HTML observations, and the current webpage screenshot. To
further enhance reasoning capabilities, we integrate RL with a hierarchical
reward structure, scaled by a difficulty-aware factor that prioritizes
challenging decision points. Empirically, our studies show that incorporating
visual grounding yields substantial gains: the combination of text and image
inputs improves exact match accuracy by more than 6% over text-only inputs.
These results indicate that multi-modal grounding not only boosts predictive
accuracy but also enhances simulation fidelity in visually complex
environments, which captures nuances of human attention and decision-making
that text-only agents often miss. Finally, we revisit the design space of
behavior simulation frameworks, identify key methodological limitations, and

objective is to understand how the various ``knobs'' of the training process
affect model quality. Using a mix of theory and controlled empirical
evaluation, we identify several design choices (patch size, embedding choice,
training objective, etc.) and show how they lead to implicit biases in
fundamental model properties (temporal behavior, geometric structure, how
aggressively or not the model regresses to the mean, etc.); and we show how

No Intelligence Without Statistics: The Invisible Backbone of Artificial Intelligence,22/10/2025,Ernest Fokoué,"The rapid ascent of artificial intelligence (AI) is often portrayed as a
revolution born from computer science and engineering. This narrative, however,
obscures a fundamental truth: the theoretical and methodological core of AI is,
and has always been, statistical. This paper systematically argues that the
field of statistics provides the indispensable foundation for machine learning
and modern AI. We deconstruct AI into nine foundational pillars-Inference,
Density Estimation, Sequential Learning, Generalization, Representation
Learning, Interpretability, Causality, Optimization, and
Unification-demonstrating that each is built upon century-old statistical
principles. From the inferential frameworks of hypothesis testing and
estimation that underpin model evaluation, to the density estimation roots of
clustering and generative AI; from the time-series analysis inspiring recurrent
networks to the causal models that promise true understanding, we trace an
unbroken statistical lineage. While celebrating the computational engines that
power modern AI, we contend that statistics provides the brain-the theoretical
frameworks, uncertainty quantification, and inferential goals-while computer
science provides the brawn-the scalable algorithms and hardware. Recognizing
this statistical backbone is not merely an academic exercise, but a necessary
step for developing more robust, interpretable, and trustworthy intelligent
systems. We issue a call to action for education, research, and practice to
re-embrace this statistical foundation. Ignoring these roots risks building a
fragile future; embracing them is the path to truly intelligent machines. There
is no machine learning without statistical learning; no artificial intelligence
without statistical thought.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19212v1,,False
News-Aware Direct Reinforcement Trading for Financial Markets,22/10/2025,"Qing-Yu Lan, Zhan-He Wang, Jun-Qian Jiang, Yu-Tong Wang, Yun-Song Piao","The financial market is known to be highly sensitive to news. Therefore,
effectively incorporating news data into quantitative trading remains an
important challenge. Existing approaches typically rely on manually designed

and volume data, as observable inputs for reinforcement learning. These inputs
are processed by sequence models such as recurrent neural networks or
Transformers to make end-to-end trading decisions. We conduct experiments using
the cryptocurrency market as an example and evaluate two representative
reinforcement learning algorithms, namely Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) and

Extreme Event Aware ($η$-) Learning,22/10/2025,"Kai Chang, Themistoklis P. Sapsis","Quantifying and predicting rare and extreme events persists as a crucial yet
challenging task in understanding complex dynamical systems. Many practical
challenges arise from the infrequency and severity of these events, including
the considerable variance of simple sampling methods and the substantial
computational cost of high-fidelity numerical simulations. Numerous data-driven
methods have recently been developed to tackle these challenges. However, a
typical assumption for the success of these methods is the occurrence of
multiple extreme events, either within the training dataset or during the
sampling process. This leads to accurate models in regions of quiescent events
but with high epistemic uncertainty in regions associated with extremes. To
overcome this limitation, we introduce Extreme Event Aware (e2a or eta) or
$\eta$-learning which does not assume the existence of extreme events in the
available data. $\eta$-learning reduces the uncertainty even in `uncharted'
extreme event regions, by enforcing the extreme event statistics of an
observable indicative of extremeness during training, which can be available
through qualitative arguments or estimated with unlabeled data. This type of
statistical regularization results in models that fit the observed data, while
enforcing consistency with the prescribed observable statistics, enabling the
generation of unprecedented extreme events even when the training data lack
extremes therein. Theoretical results based on optimal transport offer a
rigorous justification and highlight the optimality of the introduced method.
Additionally, extensive numerical experiments illustrate the favorable
properties of the $\eta$-learning framework on several prototype problems and
real-world precipitation downscaling problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.19161v1,,False
