VITA-Audio: Fast Interleaved Cross-Modal Token Generation for Efficient Large Speech-Language Model,06/05/2025,"Zuwei Long, Yunhang Shen, Chaoyou Fu, Heting Gao, Lijiang Li, Peixian Chen, Mengdan Zhang, Hang Shao, Jian Li, Jinlong Peng, Haoyu Cao, Ke Li, Rongrong Ji, Xing Sun","With the growing requirement for natural human-computer interaction,
speech-based systems receive increasing attention as speech is one of the most
common forms of daily communication. However, the existing speech models still
experience high latency when generating the first audio token during streaming,
which poses a significant bottleneck for deployment. To address this issue, we
propose VITA-Audio, an end-to-end large speech model with fast audio-text token
generation. Specifically, we introduce a lightweight Multiple Cross-modal Token
Prediction (MCTP) module that efficiently generates multiple audio tokens
within a single model forward pass, which not only accelerates the inference
but also significantly reduces the latency for generating the first audio in
streaming scenarios. In addition, a four-stage progressive training strategy is
explored to achieve model acceleration with minimal loss of speech quality. To
our knowledge, VITA-Audio is the first multi-modal large language model capable
of generating audio output during the first forward pass, enabling real-time
conversational capabilities with minimal latency. VITA-Audio is fully
reproducible and is trained on open-source data only. Experimental results
demonstrate that our model achieves an inference speedup of 3~5x at the 7B
parameter scale, but also significantly outperforms open-source models of
similar model size on multiple benchmarks for automatic speech recognition
(ASR), text-to-speech (TTS), and spoken question answering (SQA) tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03739v1,,False
Mitigating mode collapse in normalizing flows by annealing with an adaptive schedule: Application to parameter estimation,06/05/2025,"Yihang Wang, Chris Chi, Aaron R. Dinner","Normalizing flows (NFs) provide uncorrelated samples from complex
distributions, making them an appealing tool for parameter estimation. However,
the practical utility of NFs remains limited by their tendency to collapse to a
single mode of a multimodal distribution. In this study, we show that annealing
with an adaptive schedule based on the effective sample size (ESS) can mitigate
mode collapse. We demonstrate that our approach can converge the marginal
likelihood for a biochemical oscillator model fit to time-series data in
ten-fold less computation time than a widely used ensemble Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) method. We show that the ESS can also be used to reduce variance
by pruning the samples. We expect these developments to be of general use for
sampling with NFs and discuss potential opportunities for further improvements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03652v1,,False
Weighted Random Dot Product Graphs,06/05/2025,"Bernardo Marenco, Paola Bermolen, Marcelo Fiori, Federico Larroca, Gonzalo Mateos","Modeling of intricate relational patterns % through the analysis structures
of network data has become a cornerstone of contemporary statistical research
and related data science fields. Networks, represented as graphs, offer a
natural framework for this analysis. This paper extends the Random Dot Product
Graph (RDPG) model to accommodate weighted graphs, markedly broadening the
model's scope to scenarios where edges exhibit heterogeneous weight
distributions. We propose a nonparametric weighted (W)RDPG model that assigns a
sequence of latent positions to each node. Inner products of these nodal
vectors specify the moments of their incident edge weights' distribution via
moment-generating functions. In this way, and unlike prior art, the WRDPG can
discriminate between weight distributions that share the same mean but differ
in other higher-order moments. We derive statistical guarantees for an
estimator of the nodal's latent positions adapted from the workhorse adjacency
spectral embedding, establishing its consistency and asymptotic normality. We
also contribute a generative framework that enables sampling of graphs that
adhere to a (prescribed or data-fitted) WRDPG, facilitating, e.g., the analysis
and testing of observed graph metrics using judicious reference distributions.
The paper is organized to formalize the model's definition, the estimation (or
nodal embedding) process and its guarantees, as well as the methodologies for
generating weighted graphs, all complemented by illustrative and reproducible
examples showcasing the WRDPG's effectiveness in various network analytic
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03649v1,,False
Real-Time Person Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model,06/05/2025,"Jiwoo Jeong, Kirok Kim, Wooju Kim, Nam-Joon Kim","Pose-Guided Person Image Synthesis (PGPIS) generates realistic person images
conditioned on a target pose and a source image. This task plays a key role in
various real-world applications, such as sign language video generation, AR/VR,
gaming, and live streaming. In these scenarios, real-time PGPIS is critical for
providing immediate visual feedback and maintaining user immersion.However,
achieving real-time performance remains a significant challenge due to the
complexity of synthesizing high-fidelity images from diverse and dynamic human
poses. Recent diffusion-based methods have shown impressive image quality in
PGPIS, but their slow sampling speeds hinder deployment in time-sensitive
applications. This latency is particularly problematic in tasks like generating
sign language videos during live broadcasts, where rapid image updates are
required. Therefore, developing a fast and reliable PGPIS model is a crucial
step toward enabling real-time interactive systems. To address this challenge,
we propose a generative model based on flow matching (FM). Our approach enables
faster, more stable, and more efficient training and sampling. Furthermore, the
proposed model supports conditional generation and can operate in latent space,
making it especially suitable for real-time PGPIS applications where both speed
and quality are critical. We evaluate our proposed method, Real-Time Person
Image Synthesis Using a Flow Matching Model (RPFM), on the widely used
DeepFashion dataset for PGPIS tasks. Our results show that RPFM achieves
near-real-time sampling speeds while maintaining performance comparable to the
state-of-the-art models. Our methodology trades off a slight, acceptable
decrease in generated-image accuracy for over a twofold increase in generation
speed, thereby ensuring real-time performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03562v1,,False
A new membership inference attack that spots memorization in generative and predictive models: Loss-Based with Reference Model algorithm (LBRM),06/05/2025,"Faiz Taleb, Ivan Gazeau, Maryline Laurent","Generative models can unintentionally memorize training data, posing
significant privacy risks. This paper addresses the memorization phenomenon in
time series imputation models, introducing the Loss-Based with Reference Model
(LBRM) algorithm. The LBRM method leverages a reference model to enhance the
accuracy of membership inference attacks, distinguishing between training and
test data. Our contributions are twofold: first, we propose an innovative
method to effectively extract and identify memorized training data,
significantly improving detection accuracy. On average, without fine-tuning,
the AUROC improved by approximately 40\%. With fine-tuning, the AUROC increased
by approximately 60\%. Second, we validate our approach through membership
inference attacks on two types of architectures designed for time series
imputation, demonstrating the robustness and versatility of the LBRM approach
in different contexts. These results highlight the significant enhancement in
detection accuracy provided by the LBRM approach, addressing privacy risks in
time series imputation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03490v1,,False
Phenotype-Guided Generative Model for High-Fidelity Cardiac MRI Synthesis: Advancing Pretraining and Clinical Applications,06/05/2025,"Ziyu Li, Yujian Hu, Zhengyao Ding, Yiheng Mao, Haitao Li, Fan Yi, Hongkun Zhang, Zhengxing Huang","Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (CMR) imaging is a vital non-invasive tool for
diagnosing heart diseases and evaluating cardiac health. However, the limited
availability of large-scale, high-quality CMR datasets poses a major challenge
to the effective application of artificial intelligence (AI) in this domain.
Even the amount of unlabeled data and the health status it covers are difficult
to meet the needs of model pretraining, which hinders the performance of AI
models on downstream tasks. In this study, we present Cardiac Phenotype-Guided
CMR Generation (CPGG), a novel approach for generating diverse CMR data that
covers a wide spectrum of cardiac health status. The CPGG framework consists of
two stages: in the first stage, a generative model is trained using cardiac
phenotypes derived from CMR data; in the second stage, a masked autoregressive
diffusion model, conditioned on these phenotypes, generates high-fidelity CMR
cine sequences that capture both structural and functional features of the
heart in a fine-grained manner. We synthesized a massive amount of CMR to
expand the pretraining data. Experimental results show that CPGG generates
high-quality synthetic CMR data, significantly improving performance on various
downstream tasks, including diagnosis and cardiac phenotypes prediction. These
gains are demonstrated across both public and private datasets, highlighting
the effectiveness of our approach. Code is availabel at

RIFT: Closed-Loop RL Fine-Tuning for Realistic and Controllable Traffic Simulation,06/05/2025,"Keyu Chen, Wenchao Sun, Hao Cheng, Sifa Zheng","Achieving both realism and controllability in interactive closed-loop traffic
simulation remains a key challenge in autonomous driving. Data-driven
simulation methods reproduce realistic trajectories but suffer from covariate
shift in closed-loop deployment, compounded by simplified dynamics models that
further reduce reliability. Conversely, physics-based simulation methods
enhance reliable and controllable closed-loop interactions but often lack
expert demonstrations, compromising realism. To address these challenges, we
introduce a dual-stage AV-centered simulation framework that conducts open-loop
imitation learning pre-training in a data-driven simulator to capture
trajectory-level realism and multimodality, followed by closed-loop
reinforcement learning fine-tuning in a physics-based simulator to enhance
controllability and mitigate covariate shift. In the fine-tuning stage, we
propose RIFT, a simple yet effective closed-loop RL fine-tuning strategy that
preserves the trajectory-level multimodality through a GRPO-style
group-relative advantage formulation, while enhancing controllability and
training stability by replacing KL regularization with the dual-clip mechanism.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RIFT significantly improves the realism
and controllability of generated traffic scenarios, providing a robust platform
for evaluating autonomous vehicle performance in diverse and interactive
scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03344v1,,False
Mamba-Diffusion Model with Learnable Wavelet for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation,06/05/2025,"Jincheng Zhang, György Fazekas, Charalampos Saitis","The recent surge in the popularity of diffusion models for image synthesis
has attracted new attention to their potential for generation tasks in other
domains. However, their applications to symbolic music generation remain
largely under-explored because symbolic music is typically represented as
sequences of discrete events and standard diffusion models are not well-suited
for discrete data. We represent symbolic music as image-like pianorolls,
facilitating the use of diffusion models for the generation of symbolic music.
Moreover, this study introduces a novel diffusion model that incorporates our
proposed Transformer-Mamba block and learnable wavelet transform.
Classifier-free guidance is utilised to generate symbolic music with target
chords. Our evaluation shows that our method achieves compelling results in
terms of music quality and controllability, outperforming the strong baseline
in pianoroll generation. Our code is available at

Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network for Sequence Learning,06/05/2025,"Zhou Wu, Junyi An, Baile Xu, Furao Shen, Jian Zhao","Recently, the superior performance of Transformers has made them a more
robust and scalable solution for sequence modeling than traditional recurrent
neural networks (RNNs). However, the effectiveness of Transformer in capturing
long-term dependencies is primarily attributed to their comprehensive
pair-modeling process rather than inherent inductive biases toward sequence
semantics. In this study, we explore the capabilities of pure RNNs and reassess
their long-term learning mechanisms. Inspired by the physics energy transition
models that track energy changes over time, we propose a effective recurrent
structure called the``Physics-inspired Energy Transition Neural Network""
(PETNN). We demonstrate that PETNN's memory mechanism effectively stores
information over long-term dependencies. Experimental results indicate that
PETNN outperforms transformer-based methods across various sequence tasks.
Furthermore, owing to its recurrent nature, PETNN exhibits significantly lower
complexity. Our study presents an optimal foundational recurrent architecture
and highlights the potential for developing effective recurrent neural networks
in fields currently dominated by Transformer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03281v1,,False
Joint Resource Management for Energy-efficient UAV-assisted SWIPT-MEC: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,06/05/2025,"Yue Chen, Hui Kang, Jiahui Li, Geng Su, Boxiong Wang, Jiacheng Wang, Cong Liang, Shuang Liang, Dusit Niyato","The integration of simultaneous wireless information and power transfer
(SWIPT) technology in 6G Internet of Things (IoT) networks faces significant
challenges in remote areas and disaster scenarios where ground infrastructure
is unavailable. This paper proposes a novel unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) system enhanced by directional
antennas to provide both computational resources and energy support for ground
IoT terminals. However, such systems require multiple trade-off policies to
balance UAV energy consumption, terminal battery levels, and computational
resource allocation under various constraints, including limited UAV battery
capacity, non-linear energy harvesting characteristics, and dynamic task
arrivals. To address these challenges comprehensively, we formulate a
bi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously considers system energy
efficiency and terminal battery sustainability. We then reformulate this
non-convex problem with a hybrid solution space as a Markov decision process
(MDP) and propose an improved soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm with an action
simplification mechanism to enhance its convergence and generalization
capabilities. Simulation results have demonstrated that our proposed approach
outperforms various baselines in different scenarios, achieving efficient
energy management while maintaining high computational performance.
Furthermore, our method shows strong generalization ability across different
scenarios, particularly in complex environments, validating the effectiveness
of our designed boundary penalty and charging reward mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03230v1,,False
RADE: Learning Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment via Multi-Agent Conditional Diffusion,06/05/2025,"Jiawei Wang, Xintao Yan, Yao Mu, Haowei Sun, Zhong Cao, Henry X. Liu","Generating safety-critical scenarios in high-fidelity simulations offers a
promising and cost-effective approach for efficient testing of autonomous
vehicles. Existing methods typically rely on manipulating a single vehicle's
trajectory through sophisticated designed objectives to induce adversarial
interactions, often at the cost of realism and scalability. In this work, we
propose the Risk-Adjustable Driving Environment (RADE), a simulation framework
that generates statistically realistic and risk-adjustable traffic scenes.
Built upon a multi-agent diffusion architecture, RADE jointly models the
behavior of all agents in the environment and conditions their trajectories on
a surrogate risk measure. Unlike traditional adversarial methods, RADE learns
risk-conditioned behaviors directly from data, preserving naturalistic
multi-agent interactions with controllable risk levels. To ensure physical
plausibility, we incorporate a tokenized dynamics check module that efficiently
filters generated trajectories using a motion vocabulary. We validate RADE on
the real-world rounD dataset, demonstrating that it preserves statistical
realism across varying risk levels and naturally increases the likelihood of
safety-critical events as the desired risk level grows up. Our results
highlight RADE's potential as a scalable and realistic tool for AV safety
evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03178v1,,False
Soft Best-of-n Sampling for Model Alignment,06/05/2025,"Claudio Mayrink Verdun, Alex Oesterling, Himabindu Lakkaraju, Flavio P. Calmon","Best-of-$n$ (BoN) sampling is a practical approach for aligning language
model outputs with human preferences without expensive fine-tuning. BoN
sampling is performed by generating $n$ responses to a prompt and then
selecting the sample that maximizes a reward function. BoN yields high reward
values in practice at a distortion cost, as measured by the KL-divergence
between the sampled and original distribution. This distortion is coarsely
controlled by varying the number of samples: larger $n$ yields a higher reward
at a higher distortion cost. We introduce Soft Best-of-$n$ sampling, a
generalization of BoN that allows for smooth interpolation between the original
distribution and reward-maximizing distribution through a temperature parameter
$\lambda$. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that Soft Best-of-$n$
sampling converges sharply to the optimal tilted distribution at a rate of
$O(1/n)$ in KL and the expected (relative) reward. For sequences of discrete
outputs, we analyze an additive reward model that reveals the fundamental
limitations of blockwise sampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03156v1,,False
Nonparametric learning of covariate-based Markov jump processes using RKHS techniques,06/05/2025,"Yuchen Han, Arnab Ganguly, Riten Mitra","We propose a novel nonparametric approach for linking covariates to
Continuous Time Markov Chains (CTMCs) using the mathematical framework of
Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS). CTMCs provide a robust framework for
modeling transitions across clinical or behavioral states, but traditional
multistate models often rely on linear relationships. In contrast, we use a
generalized Representer Theorem to enable tractable inference in functional
space. For the Frequentist version, we apply normed square penalties, while for
the Bayesian version, we explore sparsity inducing spike and slab priors. Due
to the computational challenges posed by high-dimensional spaces, we
successfully adapt the Expectation Maximization Variable Selection (EMVS)
algorithm to efficiently identify the posterior mode. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method through extensive simulation studies and an
application to follicular cell lymphoma data. Our performance metrics include
the normalized difference between estimated and true nonlinear transition
functions, as well as the difference in the probability of getting absorbed in
one the final states, capturing the ability of our approach to predict
long-term behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03119v1,,False
Deep Learning in Renewable Energy Forecasting: A Cross-Dataset Evaluation of Temporal and Spatial Models,06/05/2025,"Lutfu Sua, Haibo Wang, Jun Huang","Unpredictability of renewable energy sources coupled with the complexity of
those methods used for various purposes in this area calls for the development
of robust methods such as DL models within the renewable energy domain. Given
the nonlinear relationships among variables in renewable energy datasets, DL
models are preferred over traditional machine learning (ML) models because they
can effectively capture and model complex interactions between variables. This
research aims to identify the factors responsible for the accuracy of DL
techniques, such as sampling, stationarity, linearity, and hyperparameter
optimization for different algorithms. The proposed DL framework compares
various methods and alternative training/test ratios. Seven ML methods, such as
Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), CNN-LSTM, Deep Neural Network (DNN), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and
Encoder-Decoder (ED), were evaluated on two different datasets. The first
dataset contains the weather and power generation data. It encompasses two
distinct datasets, hourly energy demand data and hourly weather data in Spain,
while the second dataset includes power output generated by the photovoltaic
panels at 12 locations. This study deploys regularization approaches, including
early stopping, neuron dropping, and L2 regularization, to reduce the
overfitting problem associated with DL models. The LSTM and MLP models show
superior performance. Their validation data exhibit exceptionally low root mean
square error values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.03109v1,,False
