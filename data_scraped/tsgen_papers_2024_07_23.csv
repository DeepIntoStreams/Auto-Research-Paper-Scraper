Diffusion Model Based Resource Allocation Strategy in Ultra-Reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems,22/07/2024,"Amirhassan Babazadeh Darabi, Sinem Coleri","Diffusion models are vastly used in generative AI, leveraging their
capability to capture complex data distributions. However, their potential
remains largely unexplored in the field of resource allocation in wireless
networks. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based resource
allocation strategy for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) with the
objective of minimizing total power consumption through the optimization of the
sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error
probability in the finite blocklength regime of the communication system. The
problem is first reduced to the optimization of blocklength only based on the
derivation of the optimality conditions. Then, the optimization theory solution
collects a dataset of channel gains and corresponding optimal blocklengths.
Finally, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) uses this collected
dataset to train the resource allocation algorithm that generates optimal
blocklength values conditioned on the channel state information (CSI). Via
extensive simulations, the proposed approach is shown to outperform previously
proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches with close to
optimal performance regarding total power consumption. Moreover, an improvement
of up to eighteen-fold in the reduction of critical constraint violations is
observed, further underscoring the accuracy of the solution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15784v1,,False
Parallel Split Learning with Global Sampling,22/07/2024,"Mohammad Kohankhaki, Ahmad Ayad, Mahdi Barhoush, Anke Schmeink","The expansion of IoT devices and the demands of Deep Learning have
highlighted significant challenges in Distributed Deep Learning (DDL) systems.
Parallel Split Learning (PSL) has emerged as a promising derivative of Split
Learning that is well suited for distributed learning on resource-constrained
devices. However, PSL faces several obstacles, such as large effective batch
sizes, non-IID data distributions, and the straggler effect. We view these
issues as a sampling dilemma and propose to address them by orchestrating the
mini-batch sampling process on the server side. We introduce the Uniform Global
Sampling (UGS) method to decouple the effective batch size from the number of
clients and reduce mini-batch deviation in non-IID settings. To address the
straggler effect, we introduce the Latent Dirichlet Sampling (LDS) method,
which generalizes UGS to balance the trade-off between batch deviation and
training time. Our simulations reveal that our proposed methods enhance model
accuracy by up to 34.1% in non-IID settings and reduce the training time in the
presence of stragglers by up to 62%. In particular, LDS effectively mitigates
the straggler effect without compromising model accuracy or adding significant
computational overhead compared to UGS. Our results demonstrate the potential
of our methods as a promising solution for DDL in real applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15738v1,,False
GFE-Mamba: Mamba-based AD Multi-modal Progression Assessment via Generative Feature Extraction from MCI,22/07/2024,"Zhaojie Fang, Shenghao Zhu, Yifei Chen, Binfeng Zou, Fan Jia, Linwei Qiu, Chang Liu, Yiyu Huang, Xiang Feng, Feiwei Qin, Changmiao Wang, Yeru Wang, Jin Fan, Changbiao Chu, Wan-Zhen Wu, Hu Zhao","Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is an irreversible neurodegenerative disorder that
often progresses from Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), leading to memory loss
and significantly impacting patients' lives. Clinical trials indicate that
early targeted interventions for MCI patients can potentially slow or halt the
development and progression of AD. Previous research has shown that accurate
medical classification requires the inclusion of extensive multimodal data,
such as assessment scales and various neuroimaging techniques like Magnetic
Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). However,
consistently tracking the diagnosis of the same individual over time and
simultaneously collecting multimodal data poses significant challenges. To
address this issue, we introduce GFE-Mamba, a classifier based on Generative
Feature Extraction (GFE). This classifier effectively integrates data from
assessment scales, MRI, and PET, enabling deeper multimodal fusion. It
efficiently extracts both long and short sequence information and incorporates
additional information beyond the pixel space. This approach not only improves
classification accuracy but also enhances the interpretability and stability of
the model. We constructed datasets of over 3000 samples based on the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) for a two-step training
process. Our experimental results demonstrate that the GFE-Mamba model is
effective in predicting the conversion from MCI to AD and outperforms several
state-of-the-art methods. Our source code and ADNI dataset processing code are
available at https://github.com/Tinysqua/GFE-Mamba.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15719v1,,False
Predicting the Best of N Visual Trackers,22/07/2024,"Basit Alawode, Sajid Javed, Arif Mahmood, Jiri Matas","We observe that the performance of SOTA visual trackers surprisingly strongly
varies across different video attributes and datasets. No single tracker
remains the best performer across all tracking attributes and datasets. To
bridge this gap, for a given video sequence, we predict the ""Best of the N
Trackers"", called the BofN meta-tracker. At its core, a Tracking Performance
Prediction Network (TP2N) selects a predicted best performing visual tracker
for the given video sequence using only a few initial frames. We also introduce
a frame-level BofN meta-tracker which keeps predicting best performer after
regular temporal intervals. The TP2N is based on self-supervised learning
architectures MocoV2, SwAv, BT, and DINO; experiments show that the DINO with
ViT-S as a backbone performs the best. The video-level BofN meta-tracker
outperforms, by a large margin, existing SOTA trackers on nine standard
benchmarks - LaSOT, TrackingNet, GOT-10K, VOT2019, VOT2021, VOT2022, UAV123,
OTB100, and WebUAV-3M. Further improvement is achieved by the frame-level BofN
meta-tracker effectively handling variations in the tracking scenarios within
long sequences. For instance, on GOT-10k, BofN meta-tracker average overlap is
88.7% and 91.1% with video and frame-level settings respectively. The best
performing tracker, RTS, achieves 85.20% AO. On VOT2022, BofN expected average
overlap is 67.88% and 70.98% with video and frame level settings, compared to
the best performing ARTrack, 64.12%. This work also presents an extensive
evaluation of competitive tracking methods on all commonly used benchmarks,
following their protocols. The code, the trained models, and the results will
soon be made publicly available on

A spatiotemporal deep learning framework for prediction of crack dynamics in heterogeneous solids: efficient mapping of concrete microstructures to its fracture properties,22/07/2024,"Rasoul Najafi Koopas, Shahed Rezaei, Natalie Rauter, Richard Ostwald, Rolf Lammering","A spatiotemporal deep learning framework is proposed that is capable of 2D
full-field prediction of fracture in concrete mesostructures. This framework
not only predicts fractures but also captures the entire history of the
fracture process, from the crack initiation in the interfacial transition zone
to the subsequent propagation of the cracks in the mortar matrix. In addition,
a convolutional neural network is developed which can predict the averaged
stress-strain curve of the mesostructures. The UNet modeling framework, which
comprises an encoder-decoder section with skip connections, is used as the deep
learning surrogate model. Training and test data are generated from
high-fidelity fracture simulations of randomly generated concrete
mesostructures. These mesostructures include geometric variabilities such as
different aggregate particle geometrical features, spatial distribution, and
the total volume fraction of aggregates. The fracture simulations are carried
out in Abaqus, utilizing the cohesive phase-field fracture modeling technique
as the fracture modeling approach. In this work, to reduce the number of
training datasets, the spatial distribution of three sets of material
properties for three-phase concrete mesostructures, along with the spatial
phase-field damage index, are fed to the UNet to predict the corresponding
stress and spatial damage index at the subsequent step. It is shown that after
the training process using this methodology, the UNet model is capable of
accurately predicting damage on the unseen test dataset by using 470 datasets.
Moreover, another novel aspect of this work is the conversion of irregular
finite element data into regular grids using a developed pipeline. This
approach allows for the implementation of less complex UNet architecture and
facilitates the integration of phase-field fracture equations into surrogate
models for future developments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15665v1,,False
"Evaluation of Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Penetration Testing using A3C, Q-learning and DQN",22/07/2024,"Norman Becker, Daniel Reti, Evridiki V. Ntagiou, Marcus Wallum, Hans D. Schotten","Penetration testing is the process of searching for security weaknesses by
simulating an attack. It is usually performed by experienced professionals,
where scanning and attack tools are applied. By automating the execution of
such tools, the need for human interaction and decision-making could be
reduced. In this work, a Network Attack Simulator (NASim) was used as an
environment to train reinforcement learning agents to solve three predefined
security scenarios. These scenarios cover techniques of exploitation,
post-exploitation and wiretapping. A large hyperparameter grid search was
performed to find the best hyperparameter combinations. The algorithms
Q-learning, DQN and A3C were used, whereby A3C was able to solve all scenarios
and achieve generalization. In addition, A3C could solve these scenarios with
fewer actions than the baseline automated penetration testing. Although the
training was performed on rather small scenarios and with small state and
action spaces for the agents, the results show that a penetration test can
successfully be performed by the RL agent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15656v1,,False
Psychometric Alignment: Capturing Human Knowledge Distributions via Language Models,22/07/2024,"Joy He-Yueya, Wanjing Anya Ma, Kanishk Gandhi, Benjamin W. Domingue, Emma Brunskill, Noah D. Goodman","Language models (LMs) are increasingly used to simulate human-like responses
in scenarios where accurately mimicking a population's behavior can guide
decision-making, such as in developing educational materials and designing
public policies. The objective of these simulations is for LMs to capture the
variations in human responses, rather than merely providing the expected
correct answers. Prior work has shown that LMs often generate unrealistically
accurate responses, but there are no established metrics to quantify how
closely the knowledge distribution of LMs aligns with that of humans. To
address this, we introduce ""psychometric alignment,"" a metric that measures the
extent to which LMs reflect human knowledge distribution. Assessing this
alignment involves collecting responses from both LMs and humans to the same
set of test items and using Item Response Theory to analyze the differences in
item functioning between the groups. We demonstrate that our metric can capture
important variations in populations that traditional metrics, like differences
in accuracy, fail to capture. We apply this metric to assess existing LMs for
their alignment with human knowledge distributions across three real-world
domains. We find significant misalignment between LMs and human populations,
though using persona-based prompts can improve alignment. Interestingly,
smaller LMs tend to achieve greater psychometric alignment than larger LMs.
Further, training LMs on human response data from the target distribution
enhances their psychometric alignment on unseen test items, but the
effectiveness of such training varies across domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15645v1,,False
Planning behavior in a recurrent neural network that plays Sokoban,22/07/2024,"Adrià Garriga-Alonso, Mohammad Taufeeque, Adam Gleave","To predict how advanced neural networks generalize to novel situations, it is
essential to understand how they reason. Guez et al. (2019, ""An investigation
of model-free planning"") trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) to play
Sokoban with model-free reinforcement learning. They found that adding extra
computation steps to the start of episodes at test time improves the RNN's
success rate. We further investigate this phenomenon, finding that it rapidly
emerges early on in training and then slowly fades, but only for comparatively
easier levels. The RNN also often takes redundant actions at episode starts,
and these are reduced by adding extra computation steps. Our results suggest
that the RNN learns to take time to think by `pacing', despite the per-step
penalties, indicating that training incentivizes planning capabilities. The
small size (1.29M parameters) and interesting behavior of this model make it an
excellent model organism for mechanistic interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15421v1,,False
