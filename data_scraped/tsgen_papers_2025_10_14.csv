Attention Factors for Statistical Arbitrage,13/10/2025,"Elliot L. Epstein, Rose Wang, Jaewon Choi, Markus Pelger","Statistical arbitrage exploits temporal price differences between similar
assets. We develop a framework to jointly identify similar assets through
factors, identify mispricing and form a trading policy that maximizes
risk-adjusted performance after trading costs. Our Attention Factors are
conditional latent factors that are the most useful for arbitrage trading. They
are learned from firm characteristic embeddings that allow for complex
interactions. We identify time-series signals from the residual portfolios of
our factors with a general sequence model. Estimating factors and the arbitrage
trading strategy jointly is crucial to maximize profitability after trading
costs. In a comprehensive empirical study we show that our Attention Factor
model achieves an out-of-sample Sharpe ratio above 4 on the largest U.S.
equities over a 24-year period. Our one-step solution yields an unprecedented
Sharpe ratio of 2.3 net of transaction costs. We show that weak factors are
important for arbitrage trading.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11616v1,,False
Efficient Group Lasso Regularized Rank Regression with Data-Driven Parameter Determination,13/10/2025,"Meixia Lin, Meijiao Shi, Yunhai Xiao, Qian Zhang","High-dimensional regression often suffers from heavy-tailed noise and
outliers, which can severely undermine the reliability of least-squares based
methods. To improve robustness, we adopt a non-smooth Wilcoxon score based rank
objective and incorporate structured group sparsity regularization, a natural
generalization of the lasso, yielding a group lasso regularized rank regression
method. By extending the tuning-free parameter selection scheme originally
developed for the lasso, we introduce a data-driven, simulation-based tuning
rule and further establish a finite-sample error bound for the resulting
estimator. On the computational side, we develop a proximal augmented
Lagrangian method for solving the associated optimization problem, which
eliminates the singularity issues encountered in existing methods, thereby
enabling efficient semismooth Newton updates for the subproblems. Extensive
numerical experiments demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our
proposed estimator against alternatives, and showcase the scalability of the
algorithm across both simulated and real-data settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11546v1,,False
LikePhys: Evaluating Intuitive Physics Understanding in Video Diffusion Models via Likelihood Preference,13/10/2025,"Jianhao Yuan, Fabio Pizzati, Francesco Pinto, Lars Kunze, Ivan Laptev, Paul Newman, Philip Torr, Daniele De Martini","Intuitive physics understanding in video diffusion models plays an essential
role in building general-purpose physically plausible world simulators, yet
accurately evaluating such capacity remains a challenging task due to the
difficulty in disentangling physics correctness from visual appearance in
generation. To the end, we introduce LikePhys, a training-free method that
evaluates intuitive physics in video diffusion models by distinguishing
physically valid and impossible videos using the denoising objective as an
ELBO-based likelihood surrogate on a curated dataset of valid-invalid pairs. By
testing on our constructed benchmark of twelve scenarios spanning over four
physics domains, we show that our evaluation metric, Plausibility Preference
Error (PPE), demonstrates strong alignment with human preference, outperforming
state-of-the-art evaluator baselines. We then systematically benchmark
intuitive physics understanding in current video diffusion models. Our study
further analyses how model design and inference settings affect intuitive
physics understanding and highlights domain-specific capacity variations across
physical laws. Empirical results show that, despite current models struggling
with complex and chaotic dynamics, there is a clear trend of improvement in
physics understanding as model capacity and inference settings scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11512v1,,False
Learning to Make MISTAKEs: Modeling Incorrect Student Thinking And Key Errors,13/10/2025,"Alexis Ross, Jacob Andreas","Research on reasoning in language models (LMs) predominantly focuses on
improving the correctness of their outputs. But some important applications
require modeling reasoning patterns that are incorrect. For example, automated
systems that can reason about and simulate student errors are useful for
providing real-time feedback in the classroom or offline practice for
educators-in-training. This paper presents a new method, MISTAKE, that (1)
constructs high-quality synthetic examples of reasoning errors by leveraging
cycle consistency between incorrect answers and latent misconceptions; and (2)
uses the generated data to learn models for student simulation, misconception
classification, and answer generation. We evaluate MISTAKE on three educational
tasks and find that it results in (1) higher accuracy when simulating incorrect
student answers based on specific misconceptions, (2) increased performance
inferring latent misconceptions from observed incorrect answers, and (3) higher
alignment with expert-written distractor answers when generating incorrect
answers (e.g., for multiple-choice tests).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11502v1,,False
Context-Aware Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Racing,13/10/2025,"Emran Yasser Moustafa, Ivana Dusparic","Autonomous vehicles have shown promising potential to be a groundbreaking
technology for improving the safety of road users. For these vehicles, as well
as many other safety-critical robotic technologies, to be deployed in
real-world applications, we require algorithms that can generalize well to
unseen scenarios and data. Model-based reinforcement learning algorithms (MBRL)
have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance and data efficiency across a
diverse set of domains. However, these algorithms have also shown
susceptibility to changes in the environment and its transition dynamics.
  In this work, we explore the performance and generalization capabilities of
MBRL algorithms for autonomous driving, specifically in the simulated
autonomous racing environment, Roboracer (formerly F1Tenth). We frame the
head-to-head racing task as a learning problem using contextual Markov decision
processes and parameterize the driving behavior of the adversaries using the
context of the episode, thereby also parameterizing the transition and reward
dynamics. We benchmark the behavior of MBRL algorithms in this environment and
propose a novel context-aware extension of the existing literature, cMask. We
demonstrate that context-aware MBRL algorithms generalize better to
out-of-distribution adversary behaviors relative to context-free approaches. We
also demonstrate that cMask displays strong generalization capabilities, as
well as further performance improvement relative to other context-aware MBRL
approaches when racing against adversaries with in-distribution behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11501v1,,False
How Reinforcement Learning After Next-Token Prediction Facilitates Learning,13/10/2025,"Nikolaos Tsilivis, Eran Malach, Karen Ullrich, Julia Kempe","Recent advances in reasoning domains with neural networks have primarily been
enabled by a training recipe that optimizes Large Language Models, previously
trained to predict the next-token in a sequence, with reinforcement learning
algorithms. We introduce a framework to study the success of this paradigm, and
we theoretically expose the optimization mechanisms by which reinforcement
learning improves over next-token prediction in this setting. We study learning
from mixture distributions of short and long ``chain-of-thought'' sequences
encoding a single task. In particular, when the task consists of predicting the
parity of $d$ bits and long sequences are rare, we show how reinforcement
learning after next-token prediction enables autoregressive transformers to
generalize, whereas mere next-token prediction requires extreme statistical or
computational resources to do so. We further explain how reinforcement learning
leverages increased test-time computation, manifested in longer responses, to
facilitate this learning process. In a simplified setting, we theoretically
prove that autoregressive linear models following this training recipe can
efficiently learn to predict the parity of $d$ bits as long as the proportion
of long demonstrations in the data mix is not exponentially small in the input
dimension $d$. Finally, we demonstrate these same phenomena in other settings,
including the post-training of Llama-series models on mixture variations of
common mathematical reasoning benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11495v1,,False
FedHybrid: Breaking the Memory Wall of Federated Learning via Hybrid Tensor Management,13/10/2025,"Kahou Tam, Chunlin Tian, Li Li, Haikai Zhao, ChengZhong Xu","Federated Learning (FL) emerges as a new learning paradigm that enables
multiple devices to collaboratively train a shared model while preserving data
privacy. However, one fundamental and prevailing challenge that hinders the
deployment of FL on mobile devices is the memory limitation. This paper
proposes \textit{FedHybrid}, a novel framework that effectively reduces the
memory footprint during the training process while guaranteeing the model
accuracy and the overall training progress. Specifically, \textit{FedHybrid}
first selects the participating devices for each training round by jointly
evaluating their memory budget, computing capability, and data diversity. After
that, it judiciously analyzes the computational graph and generates an
execution plan for each selected client in order to meet the corresponding
memory budget while minimizing the training delay through employing a hybrid of
recomputation and compression techniques according to the characteristic of
each tensor. During the local training process, \textit{FedHybrid} carries out
the execution plan with a well-designed activation compression technique to
effectively achieve memory reduction with minimum accuracy loss. We conduct
extensive experiments to evaluate \textit{FedHybrid} on both simulation and
off-the-shelf mobile devices. The experiment results demonstrate that
\textit{FedHybrid} achieves up to a 39.1\% increase in model accuracy and a
15.5$\times$ reduction in wall clock time under various memory budgets compared
with the baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11400v1,10.1145/3666025.3699346,False
DiffStyleTS: Diffusion Model for Style Transfer in Time Series,13/10/2025,"Mayank Nagda, Phil Ostheimer, Justus Arweiler, Indra Jungjohann, Jennifer Werner, Dennis Wagner, Aparna Muraleedharan, Pouya Jafari, Jochen Schmid, Fabian Jirasek, Jakob Burger, Michael Bortz, Hans Hasse, Stephan Mandt, Marius Kloft, Sophie Fellenz","Style transfer combines the content of one signal with the style of another.
It supports applications such as data augmentation and scenario simulation,
helping machine learning models generalize in data-scarce domains. While well
developed in vision and language, style transfer methods for time series data

disentangles a time series into content and style representations via
convolutional encoders and recombines them through a self-supervised
attention-based diffusion process. At inference, encoders extract content and
style from two distinct series, enabling conditional generation of novel
samples to achieve style transfer. We demonstrate both qualitatively and
quantitatively that DiffTSST achieves effective style transfer. We further

LouisKV: Efficient KV Cache Retrieval for Long Input-Output Sequences,13/10/2025,"Wenbo Wu, Qingyi Si, Xiurui Pan, Ye Wang, Jie Zhang","While Key-Value (KV) cache succeeds in reducing redundant computations in
auto-regressive models, it introduces significant memory overhead, limiting its
practical deployment in long-sequence scenarios. Existing KV retrieval methods
mitigate this by dynamically retaining only a subset of KV entries on the GPU.
However, they still suffer from notable efficiency and accuracy bottlenecks due
to per-token retrieval and coarse-grained page-level KV management, especially
in long-output reasoning scenarios. With the emergence of large reasoning
models, efficiently handling such scenarios has become increasingly important.
To address this issue, we present two key observations: (1) critical KVs
exhibit strong temporal locality during decoding, and (2) these KVs exhibit
distinct distribution patterns across the input prompt and generated output.
Building on these observations, we propose LouisKV, an efficient KV cache
retrieval framework designed for various long-sequence scenarios. Specifically,
LouisKV introduces a semantic-aware retrieval strategy leveraging temporal
locality to trigger retrieval only at semantic boundaries, drastically reducing
computation and data transfer overhead. LouisKV also designs a decoupled,
fine-grained management scheme that tailors differentiated strategies for input
and output sequences to create retrieval units that better match the model's
attention patterns, enabling precise identification of critical KVs.
Furthermore, to boost efficiency, LouisKV incorporates several kernel-level
optimizations, including custom Triton and CUDA kernels to accelerate the KV
clustering and retrieval. Evaluations show that LouisKV achieves up to
4.7$\times$ speedup over state-of-the-art KV retrieval methods while
maintaining near-lossless accuracy across diverse long-sequence tasks,
including long-input short-output, short-input long-output, and long-input
long-output scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11292v1,,False
Evolution in Simulation: AI-Agent School with Dual Memory for High-Fidelity Educational Dynamics,13/10/2025,"Sheng Jin, Haoming Wang, Zhiqi Gao, Yongbo Yang, Bao Chunjia, Chengliang Wang","Large language models (LLMs) based Agents are increasingly pivotal in
simulating and understanding complex human systems and interactions. We propose
the AI-Agent School (AAS) system, built around a self-evolving mechanism that
leverages agents for simulating complex educational dynamics. Addressing the
fragmented issues in teaching process modeling and the limitations of agents
performance in simulating diverse educational participants, AAS constructs the
Zero-Exp strategy, employs a continuous ""experience-reflection-optimization""
cycle, grounded in a dual memory base comprising experience and knowledge bases
and incorporating short-term and long-term memory components. Through this
mechanism, agents autonomously evolve via situated interactions within diverse
simulated school scenarios. This evolution enables agents to more accurately
model the nuanced, multi-faceted teacher-student engagements and underlying
learning processes found in physical schools. Experiment confirms that AAS can
effectively simulate intricate educational dynamics and is effective in
fostering advanced agent cognitive abilities, providing a foundational stepping

Vision-LLMs for Spatiotemporal Traffic Forecasting,13/10/2025,"Ning Yang, Hengyu Zhong, Haijun Zhang, Randall Berry","Accurate spatiotemporal traffic forecasting is a critical prerequisite for
proactive resource management in dense urban mobile networks. While Large
Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in time series analysis, they
inherently struggle to model the complex spatial dependencies of grid-based
traffic data. Effectively extending LLMs to this domain is challenging, as
representing the vast amount of information from dense geographical grids can
be inefficient and overwhelm the model's context. To address these challenges,
we propose ST-Vision-LLM, a novel framework that reframes spatiotemporal
forecasting as a vision-language fusion problem. Our approach leverages a
Vision-LLM visual encoder to process historical global traffic matrices as
image sequences, providing the model with a comprehensive global view to inform
cell-level predictions. To overcome the inefficiency of LLMs in handling
numerical data, we introduce an efficient encoding scheme that represents
floating-point values as single tokens via a specialized vocabulary, coupled
with a two-stage numerical alignment fine-tuning process. The model is first
trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and then further optimized for
predictive accuracy using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a
memory-efficient reinforcement learning method. Evaluations on real-world
mobile traffic datasets demonstrate that ST-Vision-LLM outperforms existing
methods by 15.6% in long-term prediction accuracy and exceeds the second-best
baseline by over 30.04% in cross-domain few-shot scenarios. Our extensive
experiments validate the model's strong generalization capabilities across

SeFEF: A Seizure Forecasting Evaluation Framework,13/10/2025,"Ana Sofia Carmo, Lourenço Abrunhosa Rodrigues, Ana Rita Peralta, Ana Fred, Carla Bentes, Hugo Plácido da Silva","The lack of standardization in seizure forecasting slows progress in the
field and limits the clinical translation of forecasting models. In this work,
we introduce a Python-based framework aimed at streamlining the development,
assessment, and documentation of individualized seizure forecasting algorithms.
  The framework automates data labeling, cross-validation splitting, forecast
post-processing, performance evaluation, and reporting. It supports various
forecasting horizons and includes a model card that documents implementation
details, training and evaluation settings, and performance metrics. Three
different models were implemented as a proof-of-concept. The models leveraged
features extracted from time series data and seizure periodicity. Model
performance was assessed using time series cross-validation and key
deterministic and probabilistic metrics.
  Implementation of the three models was successful, demonstrating the
flexibility of the framework. The results also emphasize the importance of
careful model interpretation due to variations in probability scaling,
calibration, and subject-specific differences. Although formal usability
metrics were not recorded, empirical observations suggest reduced development
time and methodological consistency, minimizing unintentional variations that
could affect the comparability of different approaches.
  As a proof-of-concept, this validation is inherently limited, relying on a
single-user experiment without statistical analyses or replication across
independent datasets. At this stage, our objective is to make the framework
publicly available to foster community engagement, facilitate experimentation,
and gather feedback. In the long term, we aim to contribute to the
establishment of a consensus on a standardized methodology for the development
and validation of seizure forecasting algorithms in people with epilepsy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.11275v1,,False
"From Prompts to Packets: A View from the Network on ChatGPT, Copilot, and Gemini",13/10/2025,"Antonio Montieri, Alfredo Nascita, Antonio Pescapè","Generative AI (GenAI) chatbots are now pervasive in digital ecosystems, yet
their network traffic remains largely underexplored. This study presents an
in-depth investigation of traffic generated by three leading chatbots (ChatGPT,
Copilot, and Gemini) when accessed via Android mobile apps for both text and
image generation. Using a dedicated capture architecture, we collect and label
two complementary workloads: a 60-hour generic dataset with unconstrained
prompts, and a controlled dataset built from identical prompts across GenAI
apps and replicated via conventional messaging apps to enable one-to-one
comparisons. This dual design allows us to address practical research questions
on the distinctiveness of GenAI traffic, its differences from widely deployed
traffic categories, and its novel implications for network usage. To this end,
we provide fine-grained traffic characterization at trace, flow, and protocol
levels, and model packet-sequence dynamics with Multimodal Markov Chains. Our
analyses reveal app- and content-specific traffic patterns, particularly in
volume, uplink/downlink profiles, and protocol adoption. We highlight the
predominance of TLS, with Gemini extensively leveraging QUIC, ChatGPT
exclusively using TLS 1.3, and app- and content-specific Server Name Indication
(SNI) values. A payload-based occlusion analysis quantifies SNI's contribution
to classification: masking it reduces F1-score by up to 20 percentage points in
GenAI app traffic classification. Finally, compared with conventional messaging
apps when carrying the same content, GenAI chatbots exhibit unique traffic
characteristics, highlighting new stress factors for mobile networks, such as
sustained upstream activity, with direct implications for network monitoring

DemoHLM: From One Demonstration to Generalizable Humanoid Loco-Manipulation,13/10/2025,"Yuhui Fu, Feiyang Xie, Chaoyi Xu, Jing Xiong, Haoqi Yuan, Zongqing Lu","Loco-manipulation is a fundamental challenge for humanoid robots to achieve
versatile interactions in human environments. Although recent studies have made
significant progress in humanoid whole-body control, loco-manipulation remains
underexplored and often relies on hard-coded task definitions or costly
real-world data collection, which limits autonomy and generalization. We
present DemoHLM, a framework for humanoid loco-manipulation that enables
generalizable loco-manipulation on a real humanoid robot from a single
demonstration in simulation. DemoHLM adopts a hierarchy that integrates a
low-level universal whole-body controller with high-level manipulation policies
for multiple tasks. The whole-body controller maps whole-body motion commands
to joint torques and provides omnidirectional mobility for the humanoid robot.
The manipulation policies, learned in simulation via our data generation and
imitation learning pipeline, command the whole-body controller with closed-loop
visual feedback to execute challenging loco-manipulation tasks. Experiments
show a positive correlation between the amount of synthetic data and policy
performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our data generation pipeline and
the data efficiency of our approach. Real-world experiments on a Unitree G1

Aligning Deep Implicit Preferences by Learning to Reason Defensively,13/10/2025,"Peiming Li, Zhiyuan Hu, Yang Tang, Shiyu Li, Xi Chen","Personalized alignment is crucial for enabling Large Language Models (LLMs)
to engage effectively in user-centric interactions. However, current methods
face a dual challenge: they fail to infer users' deep implicit preferences
(including unstated goals, semantic context and risk tolerances), and they lack
the defensive reasoning required to navigate real-world ambiguity. This
cognitive gap leads to responses that are superficial, brittle and
short-sighted. To address this, we propose Critique-Driven Reasoning Alignment
(CDRA), which reframes alignment from a scalar reward-matching task into a
structured reasoning process. First, to bridge the preference inference gap, we
introduce the DeepPref benchmark. This dataset, comprising 3000
preference-query pairs across 20 topics, is curated by simulating a
multi-faceted cognitive council that produces critique-annotated reasoning
chains to deconstruct query semantics and reveal latent risks. Second, to
instill defensive reasoning, we introduce the Personalized Generative Process
Reward Model (Pers-GenPRM), which frames reward modeling as a personalized
reasoning task. It generates a critique chain to evaluate a response's
alignment with user preferences before outputting a final score based on this
rationale. Ultimately, this interpretable, structured reward signal guides
policy model through Critique-Driven Policy Alignment, a process-level online
reinforcement learning algorithm integrating both numerical and natural
language feedback. Experiments demonstrate that CDRA excels at discovering and
aligning with users' true preferences while executing robust reasoning. Our

delivers consistent gains across diverse open-source LLMs and GPT-4, achieving
up to 17.2% ROUGE-L improvement (average +7%) and even surpassing fine-tuned

EAGER: Entropy-Aware GEneRation for Adaptive Inference-Time Scaling,13/10/2025,"Daniel Scalena, Leonidas Zotos, Elisabetta Fersini, Malvina Nissim, Ahmet Üstün","With the rise of reasoning language models and test-time scaling methods as a
paradigm for improving model performance, substantial computation is often
required to generate multiple candidate sequences from the same prompt. This
enables exploration of different reasoning paths toward the correct solution,

to reduce redundant computation and concurrently improve overall performance.
EAGer allows branching to multiple reasoning paths only in the presence of
high-entropy tokens, and then reallocates the saved compute budget to the

Enhanced Sampling for Efficient Learning of Coarse-Grained Machine Learning Potentials,13/10/2025,"Weilong Chen, Franz Görlich, Paul Fuchs, Julija Zavadlav","Coarse-graining (CG) enables molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of larger
systems and longer timescales that are otherwise infeasible with atomistic
models. Machine learning potentials (MLPs), with their capacity to capture
many-body interactions, can provide accurate approximations of the potential of
mean force (PMF) in CG models. Current CG MLPs are typically trained in a
bottom-up manner via force matching, which in practice relies on configurations
sampled from the unbiased equilibrium Boltzmann distribution to ensure
thermodynamic consistency. This convention poses two key limitations: first,
sufficiently long atomistic trajectories are needed to reach convergence; and
second, even once equilibrated, transition regions remain poorly sampled. To
address these issues, we employ enhanced sampling to bias along CG degrees of
freedom for data generation, and then recompute the forces with respect to the
unbiased potential. This strategy simultaneously shortens the simulation time
required to produce equilibrated data and enriches sampling in transition
regions, while preserving the correct PMF. We demonstrate its effectiveness on
the M\""uller-Brown potential and capped alanine, achieving notable
improvements. Our findings support the use of enhanced sampling for force

Graph Neural Network-Based Multicast Routing for On-Demand Streaming Services in 6G Networks,13/10/2025,"Xiucheng Wang, Zien Wang, Nan Cheng, Wenchao Xu, Wei Quan, Xuemin Shen","The increase of bandwidth-intensive applications in sixth-generation (6G)
wireless networks, such as real-time volumetric streaming and multi-sensory

delivering differentiated quality-of-service (QoS) at scale. Traditional
shortest-path and multicast routing algorithms are either computationally
prohibitive or structurally rigid, and they often fail to support heterogeneous
user demands, leading to suboptimal resource utilization. Neural network-based
approaches, while offering improved inference speed, typically lack topological
generalization and scalability. To address these limitations, this paper
presents a graph neural network (GNN)-based multicast routing framework that
jointly minimizes total transmission cost and supports user-specific video

minimum-flow optimization task, and a reinforcement learning algorithm is
developed to sequentially construct efficient multicast trees by reusing paths

decisions. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method closely
approximates optimal dynamic programming-based solutions while significantly
reducing computational complexity. The results also confirm strong

HoMer: Addressing Heterogeneities by Modeling Sequential and Set-wise Contexts for CTR Prediction,13/10/2025,"Shuwei Chen, Jiajun Cui, Zhengqi Xu, Fan Zhang, Jiangke Fan, Teng Zhang, Xingxing Wang","Click-through rate (CTR) prediction, which models behavior sequence and
non-sequential features (e.g., user/item profiles or cross features) to infer
user interest, underpins industrial recommender systems. However, most methods
face three forms of heterogeneity that degrade predictive performance: (i)
Feature Heterogeneity persists when limited sequence side features provide less
granular interest representation compared to extensive non-sequential features,
thereby impairing sequence modeling performance; (ii) Context Heterogeneity
arises because a user's interest in an item will be influenced by other items,
yet point-wise prediction neglects cross-item interaction context from the
entire item set; (iii) Architecture Heterogeneity stems from the fragmented
integration of specialized network modules, which compounds the model's
effectiveness, efficiency and scalability in industrial deployments. To tackle
the above limitations, we propose HoMer, a Homogeneous-Oriented TransforMer for

dual optimization through structural simplification and shared computation,
ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining scalability with model
size. Without arduous modification to the prediction pipeline, HoMer
successfully scales up and outperforms our industrial baseline by 0.0099 in the

GrASP: A Generalizable Address-based Semantic Prefetcher for Scalable Transactional and Analytical Workloads,13/10/2025,"Farzaneh Zirak, Farhana Choudhury, Renata Borovica-Gajic","Data prefetching--loading data into the cache before it is requested--is

traditional prefetchers focus on sequential patterns, recent learning-based
approaches, especially those leveraging data semantics, achieve higher accuracy
for complex access patterns. However, these methods often struggle with today's
dynamic, ever-growing datasets and require frequent, timely fine-tuning.
Privacy constraints may also restrict access to complete datasets,
necessitating prefetchers that can learn effectively from samples. To address
these challenges, we present GrASP, a learning-based prefetcher designed for

Neutral Agent-based Adversarial Policy Learning against Deep Reinforcement Learning in Multi-party Open Systems,13/10/2025,"Qizhou Peng, Yang Zheng, Yu Wen, Yanna Wu, Yingying Du","Reinforcement learning (RL) has been an important machine learning paradigm
for solving long-horizon sequential decision-making problems under uncertainty.
By integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) into the RL framework, deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) has emerged, which achieved significant success in
various domains. However, the integration of DNNs also makes it vulnerable to
adversarial attacks. Existing adversarial attack techniques mainly focus on
either directly manipulating the environment with which a victim agent
interacts or deploying an adversarial agent that interacts with the victim
agent to induce abnormal behaviors. While these techniques achieve promising
results, their adoption in multi-party open systems remains limited due to two
major reasons: impractical assumption of full control over the environment and
dependent on interactions with victim agents.
  To enable adversarial attacks in multi-party open systems, in this paper, we
redesigned an adversarial policy learning approach that can mislead
well-trained victim agents without requiring direct interactions with these
agents or full control over their environments. Particularly, we propose a
neutral agent-based approach across various task scenarios in multi-party open
systems. While the neutral agents seemingly are detached from the victim
agents, indirectly influence them through the shared environment. We evaluate
our proposed method on the SMAC platform based on Starcraft II and the
autonomous driving simulation platform Highway-env. The experimental results
demonstrate that our method can launch general and effective adversarial
attacks in multi-party open systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10937v1,,False
TabVLA: Targeted Backdoor Attacks on Vision-Language-Action Models,13/10/2025,"Zonghuan Xu, Xiang Zheng, Xingjun Ma, Yu-Gang Jiang","With the growing deployment of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models in
real-world embodied AI systems, their increasing vulnerability to backdoor
attacks poses a serious safety threat. A backdoored VLA agent can be covertly
triggered by a pre-injected backdoor to execute adversarial actions,
potentially causing system failures or even physical harm. Although backdoor
attacks on VLA models have been explored, prior work has focused only on
untargeted attacks, leaving the more practically threatening scenario of
targeted manipulation unexamined. In this paper, we study targeted backdoor
attacks on VLA models and introduce TabVLA, a novel framework that enables such
attacks via black-box fine-tuning. TabVLA explores two deployment-relevant
inference-time threat models: input-stream editing and in-scene triggering. It
formulates poisoned data generation as an optimization problem to improve
attack effectivess. Experiments with OpenVLA-7B on the LIBERO benchmark reveal
that the vision channel is the principal attack surface: targeted backdoors
succeed with minimal poisoning, remain robust across variations in trigger
design, and are degraded only by positional mismatches between fine-tuning and
inference triggers. We also investigate a potential detection-based defense
against TabVLA, which reconstructs latent visual triggers from the input stream
to flag activation-conditioned backdoor samples. Our work highlights the
vulnerability of VLA models to targeted backdoor manipulation and underscores
the need for more advanced defenses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10932v1,,False

LLM-Empowered Agentic MAC Protocols: A Dynamic Stackelberg Game Approach,13/10/2025,"Renxuan Tan, Rongpeng Li, Fei Wang, Chenghui Peng, Shaoyun Wu, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang","Medium Access Control (MAC) protocols, essential for wireless networks, are
typically manually configured. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based
protocols enhance task-specified network performance, they suffer from poor
generalizability and resilience, demanding costly retraining to adapt to

game-theoretic LLM-empowered multi-agent DRL (MARL) framework, in which the
uplink transmission between a base station and a varying number of user
equipments is modeled as a dynamic multi-follower Stackelberg game (MFSG),
capturing the network's natural hierarchical structure. Within this game,
LLM-driven agents, coordinated through proximal policy optimization (PPO),
synthesize adaptive, semantic MAC protocols in response to network dynamics.
Protocol action grammar (PAG) is employed to ensure the reliability and
efficiency of this process. Under this system, we further analyze the existence
and convergence behavior in terms of a Stackelberg equilibrium by studying the
learning dynamics of LLM-empowered unified policies in response to changing
followers. Simulations corroborate that our framework achieves a 77.6% greater

one for academics and practitioners alike. Bubble labels are generated using a
Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, sentiment scores, and a hype index we
introduced in previous research on NLP forecasting of stock return volatility.
Using these tools, a dual-stream transformer model is trained with market data
and machine learning methods, resulting in a time series of confidence scores
as a Bubble Score. A distinctive feature of our framework is that it captures
phases of extreme overpricing and underpricing within a unified structure.
  We achieve an average yield of 34.13 percentage annualized return when
backtesting U.S. equities during the period 2018 to 2024, while the approach
exhibits a remarkable generalization ability across industry sectors. Its
conservative bias in predicting bubble periods minimizes false positives, a

GRIP: A Unified Framework for Grid-Based Relay and Co-Occurrence-Aware Planning in Dynamic Environments,13/10/2025,"Ahmed Alanazi, Duy Ho, Yugyung Lee","Robots navigating dynamic, cluttered, and semantically complex environments
must integrate perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial planning to
generalize across diverse layouts and object categories. Existing methods often

variants: GRIP-L (Lightweight), optimized for symbolic navigation via semantic
occupancy grids; GRIP-F (Full), supporting multi-hop anchor chaining and
LLM-based introspection; and GRIP-R (Real-World), enabling physical robot
deployment under perceptual uncertainty. GRIP integrates dynamic 2D grid

"LLMs as Strategic Agents: Beliefs, Best Response Behavior, and Emergent Heuristics",12/10/2025,"Enric Junque de Fortuny, Veronica Roberta Cappelli","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to domains that require
reasoning about other agents' behavior, such as negotiation, policy design, and
market simulation, yet existing research has mostly evaluated their adherence
to equilibrium play or their exhibited depth of reasoning. Whether they display
genuine strategic thinking, understood as the coherent formation of beliefs
about other agents, evaluation of possible actions, and choice based on those
beliefs, remains unexplored. We develop a framework to identify this ability by
disentangling beliefs, evaluation, and choice in static, complete-information
games, and apply it across a series of non-cooperative environments. By jointly
analyzing models' revealed choices and reasoning traces, and introducing a new
context-free game to rule out imitation from memorization, we show that current
frontier models exhibit belief-coherent best-response behavior at targeted
reasoning depths. When unconstrained, they self-limit their depth of reasoning
and form differentiated conjectures about human and synthetic opponents,
revealing an emergent form of meta-reasoning. Under increasing complexity,
explicit recursion gives way to internally generated heuristic rules of choice
that are stable, model-specific, and distinct from known human biases. These
findings indicate that belief coherence, meta-reasoning, and novel heuristic
formation can emerge jointly from language modeling objectives, providing a
structured basis for the study of strategic cognition in artificial agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10813v1,,False
How Patterns Dictate Learnability in Sequential Data,12/10/2025,"Mario Morawski, Anais Despres, Rémi Rehm","Sequential data - ranging from financial time series to natural language -
has driven the growing adoption of autoregressive models. However, these
algorithms rely on the presence of underlying patterns in the data, and their
identification often depends heavily on human expertise. Misinterpreting these
patterns can lead to model misspecification, resulting in increased
generalization error and degraded performance. The recently proposed evolving
pattern (EvoRate) metric addresses this by using the mutual information between
the next data point and its past to guide regression order estimation and
feature selection. Building on this idea, we introduce a general framework
based on predictive information, defined as the mutual information between the
past and the future, $I(X_{past}; X_{future})$. This quantity naturally defines
an information-theoretic learning curve, which quantifies the amount of
predictive information available as the observation window grows. Using this
formalism, we show that the presence or absence of temporal patterns
fundamentally constrains the learnability of sequential models: even an optimal
predictor cannot outperform the intrinsic information limit imposed by the
data. We validate our framework through experiments on synthetic data,
demonstrating its ability to assess model adequacy, quantify the inherent
complexity of a dataset, and reveal interpretable structure in sequential data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10744v1,,False

concentrations (Non-Interactive Tracers or NINT) to reduce computational costs.
While NINT significantly cuts computations, it fails to capture real-time

NINT interactively calculates concentrations using ML with surface emissions

Compositional Symmetry as Compression: Lie Pseudogroup Structure in Algorithmic Agents,12/10/2025,Giulio Ruffini,"In the algorithmic (Kolmogorov) view, agents are programs that track and
compress sensory streams using generative programs. We propose a framework
where the relevant structural prior is simplicity (Solomonoff) understood as
\emph{compositional symmetry}: natural streams are well described by (local)
actions of finite-parameter Lie pseudogroups on geometrically and topologically
complex low-dimensional configuration manifolds (latent spaces). Modeling the
agent as a generic neural dynamical system coupled to such streams, we show
that accurate world-tracking imposes (i) \emph{structural constraints} --
equivariance of the agent's constitutive equations and readouts -- and (ii)
\emph{dynamical constraints}: under static inputs, symmetry induces conserved
quantities (Noether-style labels) in the agent dynamics and confines
trajectories to reduced invariant manifolds; under slow drift, these manifolds
move but remain low-dimensional. This yields a hierarchy of reduced manifolds
aligned with the compositional factorization of the pseudogroup, providing a
geometric account of the ``blessing of compositionality'' in deep models. We

artificial intelligence techniques. PMGF leverages a vertical autoencoder to
encode motion sequences into athlete-specific latent representations, which can
then be directly manipulated to generate meaningful guidance motions. Two
manipulation strategies were explored: (1) smooth interpolation between the
learner's motion and a target (e.g., expert) motion to facilitate observational

latent space using a local optimization technique. The results of the
validation experiment with data from 51 baseball pitchers revealed that (1)
PMGF successfully generated smooth transitions in motion patterns between
individuals across all 1,275 pitcher pairs, and (2) the features significantly

equation attains a mean square error (MSE) on the order of $10^{-3}$, while the
diffusion$-$sorption equation achieves an MSE on the order of $10^{-4}$ after
12,500 iterations, with no further improvement as the iterations increase. In
contrast, the MSE for both PDEs in the gST$-$PINN model continues to decrease,
demonstrating better generalization and reaching an MSE on the order of
$10^{-5}$ after 18,500 iterations. Furthermore, the results show that the
proposed purely semi$-$supervised gST$-$PINN consistently outperforms the
standard PINN method in all cases, even when solution of the PDEs are

LightSAE: Parameter-Efficient and Heterogeneity-Aware Embedding for IoT Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,12/10/2025,"Yi Ren, Xinjie Yu","Modern Internet of Things (IoT) systems generate massive, heterogeneous
multivariate time series data. Accurate Multivariate Time Series Forecasting
(MTSF) of such data is critical for numerous applications. However, existing
methods almost universally employ a shared embedding layer that processes all
channels identically, creating a representational bottleneck that obscures
valuable channel-specific information. To address this challenge, we introduce
a Shared-Auxiliary Embedding (SAE) framework that decomposes the embedding into
a shared base component capturing common patterns and channel-specific
auxiliary components modeling unique deviations. Within this decomposition, we
\rev{empirically observe} that the auxiliary components tend to exhibit
low-rank and clustering characteristics, a structural pattern that is
significantly less apparent when using purely independent embeddings.
Consequently, we design LightSAE, a parameter-efficient embedding module that
operationalizes these observed characteristics through low-rank factorization
and a shared, gated component pool. Extensive experiments across 9 IoT-related
datasets and 4 backbone architectures demonstrate LightSAE's effectiveness,
achieving MSE improvements of up to 22.8\% with only 4.0\% parameter increase.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10465v1,,False

locomotion dynamics are seldom known, relying solely on mathematical models is
insufficient; constructing a simulator that both reproduces real trajectories

Learning the Exact SABR Model,11/10/2025,"Giorgia Rensi, Pietro Rossi, Marco Bianchetti","The SABR model is a cornerstone of interest rate volatility modeling, but its
practical application relies heavily on the analytical approximation by Hagan

approaches have been proposed to overcome these limitations, they have often
been limited by simplified SABR dynamics or a lack of systematic validation

  We develop a novel SABR DNN, a specialized Artificial Deep Neural Network

Sample-Efficient Online Learning in LM Agents via Hindsight Trajectory Rewriting,11/10/2025,"Michael Y. Hu, Benjamin Van Durme, Jacob Andreas, Harsh Jhamtani","Language model (LM) agents deployed in novel environments often exhibit poor
sample efficiency when learning from sequential interactions. This
significantly hinders the usefulness of such agents in environments where
interaction is costly (for example, when they interact with humans or reset
physical systems). While a number of existing LM agent architectures
incorporate various mechanisms for experience storage and reflection, they make
limited use of LMs' abilities to directly generate or reason about full
counterfactual trajectories. We introduce ECHO (Experience Consolidation via
Hindsight Optimization), a prompting framework that adapts hindsight experience

optimized trajectories for alternative goals that could have been achieved
during failed attempts, effectively creating synthetic positive examples from
unsuccessful interactions. Our approach consists of two components: a hindsight
rule that uses the language model itself to identify relevant subgoals and
generate optimized trajectories, and an update rule that maintains compressed

Lost in the Middle: An Emergent Property from Information Retrieval Demands in LLMs,11/10/2025,"Nikolaus Salvatore, Hao Wang, Qiong Zhang","The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) often degrades when crucial
information is in the middle of a long context, a ""lost-in-the-middle""
phenomenon that mirrors the primacy and recency effects in human memory. We
propose that this behavior is not simply a flaw indicative of information loss
but an adaptation to different information retrieval demands during
pre-training: some tasks require uniform recall across the entire input (a
long-term memory demand), while others prioritize the most recent information
(a short-term memory demand). Consistent with this view, we show that this
U-shaped performance curve emerges when LLMs (GPT-2 and Llama variants) are
trained from scratch on two simple human memory paradigms simulating long-term
and short-term memory demands. Our analysis reveals that while the recency
effect directly aligns with short-term memory demand in the training data, the
primacy effect is induced by the uniform long-term memory demand and is
additionally influenced by the model's autoregressive properties and the
formation of attention sinks. Our main findings from simple human memory
paradigms also generalize to a sequence completion task, which more closely
resembles the next-token prediction process in LLM pre-training. Together, our
findings reveal how information retrieval demands, model architecture, and
structural attention dynamics during model training can jointly produce
positional bias observed in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10276v1,,False
Neural variational inference for cutting feedback during uncertainty propagation,11/10/2025,"Jiafang Song, Sandipan Pramanik, Abhirup Datta","In many scientific applications, uncertainty of estimates from an earlier
(upstream) analysis needs to be propagated in subsequent (downstream) Bayesian
analysis, without feedback. Cutting feedback methods, also termed cut-Bayes,
achieve this by constructing a cut-posterior distribution that prevents
backward information flow. Cutting feedback like nested MCMC is computationally
challenging while variational inference (VI) cut-Bayes methods need two
variational approximations and require access to the upstream data and model.
In this manuscript we propose, NeVI-Cut, a provably accurate and modular neural
network-based variational inference method for cutting feedback. We directly
utilize samples from the upstream analysis without requiring access to the
upstream data or model. This simultaneously preserves modularity of analysis
and reduces approximation errors by avoiding a variational approximation for
the upstream model. We then use normalizing flows to specify the conditional
variational family for the downstream parameters and estimate the conditional
cut-posterior as a variational solution of Monte Carlo average loss over all
the upstream samples. We provide theoretical guarantees on the NeVI-Cut
estimate to approximate any cut-posterior. Our results are in a fixed-data
regime and provide convergence rates of the actual variational solution,
quantifying how richness of the neural architecture and the complexity of the
target cut-posterior dictate the approximation quality. In the process, we
establish new results on uniform Kullback-Leibler approximation rates of
conditional normalizing flows. Simulation studies and two real-world analyses
illustrate how NeVI-Cut achieves significant computational gains over
traditional cutting feedback methods and is considerably more accurate than
parametric variational cut approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10268v1,,False
UF-RNN: Real-Time Adaptive Motion Generation Using Uncertainty-Driven Foresight Prediction,11/10/2025,"Hyogo Hiruma, Hiroshi Ito, Tetsuya Ogata","Training robots to operate effectively in environments with uncertain states,
such as ambiguous object properties or unpredictable interactions, remains a
longstanding challenge in robotics. Imitation learning methods typically rely
on successful examples and often neglect failure scenarios where uncertainty is
most pronounced. To address this limitation, we propose the Uncertainty-driven
Foresight Recurrent Neural Network (UF-RNN), a model that combines standard
time-series prediction with an active ""Foresight"" module. This module performs
internal simulations of multiple future trajectories and refines the hidden
state to minimize predicted variance, enabling the model to selectively explore
actions under high uncertainty. We evaluate UF-RNN on a door-opening task in
both simulation and a real-robot setting, demonstrating that, despite the
absence of explicit failure demonstrations, the model exhibits robust
adaptation by leveraging self-induced chaotic dynamics in its latent space.
When guided by the Foresight module, these chaotic properties stimulate
exploratory behaviors precisely when the environment is ambiguous, yielding
improved success rates compared to conventional stochastic RNN baselines. These
findings suggest that integrating uncertainty-driven foresight into imitation
learning pipelines can significantly enhance a robot's ability to handle
unpredictable real-world conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.10217v1,,False
Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis,11/10/2025,"Zhechong Huang, Zhao Zhang, Ruyi Ji, Tingxuan Xia, Qihao Zhu, Qinxiang Cao, Zeyu Sun, Yingfei Xiong","Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation;
nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although
traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by
externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively

performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes
type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type
system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis
system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and
synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on
synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token
sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the
representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward
higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only
eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness,

Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer for Jointly Simulating User Mobility and Mobile Traffic Pattern,11/10/2025,"Ziyi Liu, Qingyue Long, Zhiwen Xue, Huandong Wang, Yong Li","User mobility trajectory and mobile traffic data are essential for a wide
spectrum of applications including urban planning, network optimization, and
emergency management. However, large-scale and fine-grained mobility data

making it essential to simulate realistic mobility and traffic patterns. User
trajectories and mobile traffic are fundamentally coupled, reflecting both
physical mobility and cyber behavior in urban environments. Despite this strong
interdependence, existing studies often model them separately, limiting the
ability to capture cross-modal dynamics. Therefore, a unified framework is
crucial. In this paper, we propose MSTDiff, a Multi-Scale Diffusion Transformer

applies discrete wavelet transforms for multi-resolution traffic decomposition.
Second, it uses a hybrid denoising network to process continuous traffic
volumes and discrete location sequences. A transition mechanism based on urban

trajectory generation. Finally, a multi-scale Transformer with cross-attention
captures dependencies between trajectories and traffic. Experiments show that
MSTDiff surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in traffic and trajectory

CacheClip: Accelerating RAG with Effective KV Cache Reuse,11/10/2025,"Bin Yang, Qiuyu Leng, Jun Zeng, Zhenhua Wu","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems suffer from severe
time-to-first-token (TTFT) bottlenecks due to long input sequences. Existing KV
cache reuse methods face a fundamental trade-off: prefix caching requires
identical prefixes that rarely occur in RAG scenarios, while direct
precomputation sacrifices quality due to missing inter-chunk attention and
repeated attention sinks. Recent methods like APE and CacheBlend partially
address these issues but remain inadequate for robust RAG applications. This
paper presents CacheClip, a novel framework that achieves both fast TTFT and
high generation quality. Our key insight is that small auxiliary LLMs exhibit
similar last-layer attention distributions to primary LLMs (the target model
for generation), enabling efficient identification of tokens critical for
restoring inter-chunk attention, thereby significantly improving response
quality on cross-chunk reasoning tasks. CacheClip integrates three techniques:
(1) auxiliary-model-guided token selection for selective KV cache
recomputation, where the auxiliary model is finetuned to improve selection
accuracy, (2) shared prefixes to eliminate redundant attention sinks, and (3)
grouping strategy to maintain local coherence during partial KV cache updates.

attributes such as time, context, and transaction type, constitutes a
behavioral token. Modeling these high-cardinality sequences is challenging, and
discriminative models often falter under limited supervision. To bridge this

supervised data. Reinforcement learning (RL) provides a promising path for
improving and fine-tuning VLAs through online interaction. However,
conventional policy gradient methods are computationally infeasible in the
context of flow-matching based models due to the intractability of the
importance sampling process, which requires explicit computation of policy
ratios. To overcome this limitation, we propose Flow Policy Optimization (FPO)
algorithm, which reformulates importance sampling by leveraging per-sample
changes in the conditional flow-matching objective. Furthermore, FPO achieves
stable and scalable online reinforcement fine-tuning of the $\pi_0$ model by
integrating structure-aware credit assignment to enhance gradient efficiency,
clipped surrogate objectives to stabilize optimization, multi-step latent
exploration to encourage diverse policy updates, and a Q-ensemble mechanism to
provide robust value estimation. We evaluate FPO on the LIBERO benchmark and
the ALOHA simulation task against supervised, preference-aligned,
diffusion-based, autoregressive online RL, and $\pi_0$-FAST baselines,
observing consistent improvements over the imitation prior and strong
alternatives with stable learning under sparse rewards. In addition, ablation
studies and analyses of the latent space dynamics further highlight the
contributions of individual components within FPO, validating the effectiveness
of the proposed computational modules and the stable convergence of the
conditional flow-matching objective during online RL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09976v1,,False
Egocentric Visual Navigation through Hippocampal Sequences,11/10/2025,"Xiao-Xiong Lin, Yuk Hoi Yiu, Christian Leibold","Sequential activation of place-tuned neurons in an animal during navigation
is typically interpreted as reflecting the sequence of input from adjacent
positions along the trajectory. More recent theories about such place cells
suggest sequences arise from abstract cognitive objectives like planning. Here,
we propose a mechanistic and parsimonious interpretation to complement these
ideas: hippocampal sequences arise from intrinsic recurrent circuitry that
propagates activity without readily available input, acting as a temporal
memory buffer for extremely sparse inputs.We implement a minimal sequence
generator inspired by neurobiology and pair it with an actor-critic learner for
egocentric visual navigation. Our agent reliably solves a continuous maze
without explicit geometric cues, with performance depending on the length of
the recurrent sequence. Crucially, the model outperforms LSTM cores under
sparse input conditions (16 channels, ~2.5% activity), but not under dense
input, revealing a strong interaction between representational sparsity and
memory architecture.In contrast to LSTM agents, hidden sequence units develop
localized place fields, distance-dependent spatial kernels, and task-dependent
remapping, while inputs orthogonalize and spatial information increases across
layers. These phenomena align with neurobiological data and are causal to
performance. Together, our results show that sparse input synergizes with
sequence-generating dynamics, providing both a mechanistic account of place
cell sequences in the mammalian hippocampus and a simple inductive bias for
reinforcement learning based on sparse egocentric inputs in navigation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09951v1,,False
MemPromptTSS: Persistent Prompt Memory for Iterative Multi-Granularity Time Series State Segmentation,11/10/2025,"Ching Chang, Ming-Chih Lo, Chiao-Tung Chan, Wen-Chih Peng, Tien-Fu Chen","Web platforms, mobile applications, and connected sensing systems generate
multivariate time series with states at multiple levels of granularity, from
coarse regimes to fine-grained events. Effective segmentation in these settings
requires integrating across granularities while supporting iterative refinement
through sparse prompt signals, which provide a compact mechanism for injecting
domain knowledge. Yet existing prompting approaches for time series
segmentation operate only within local contexts, so the effect of a prompt
quickly fades and cannot guide predictions across the entire sequence. To
overcome this limitation, we propose MemPromptTSS, a framework for iterative
multi-granularity segmentation that introduces persistent prompt memory. A
memory encoder transforms prompts and their surrounding subsequences into
memory tokens stored in a bank. This persistent memory enables each new
prediction to condition not only on local cues but also on all prompts
accumulated across iterations, ensuring their influence persists across the
entire sequence. Experiments on six datasets covering wearable sensing and
industrial monitoring show that MemPromptTSS achieves 23% and 85% accuracy
improvements over the best baseline in single- and multi-granularity
segmentation under single iteration inference, and provides stronger refinement
in iterative inference with average per-iteration gains of 2.66 percentage
points compared to 1.19 for PromptTSS. These results highlight the importance
of persistent memory for prompt-guided segmentation, establishing MemPromptTSS
as a practical and effective framework for real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09930v1,,False
DELTA: Dynamic Layer-Aware Token Attention for Efficient Long-Context Reasoning,10/10/2025,"Hossein Entezari Zarch, Lei Gao, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavarm","Large reasoning models (LRMs) achieve state-of-the-art performance on
challenging benchmarks by generating long chains of intermediate steps, but
their inference cost is dominated by decoding, where each new token must attend
to the entire growing sequence. Existing sparse attention methods reduce
computation by pruning the key-value (KV) cache, yet they suffer from severe
accuracy degradation on reasoning tasks due to cumulative selection errors and
the dynamic importance of tokens over long derivations. We present
\textbf{DELTA}, a training-free sparse attention mechanism that achieves
computational efficiency without sacrificing model accuracy. DELTA partitions
transformer layers into three groups: initial layers that use full attention, a
small set of \emph{selection layers} that identify salient tokens via
aggregated head-level attention scores, and subsequent \emph{sparse-attention
layers} that attend only to the selected subset. This design preserves the full
KV cache in GPU memory for accuracy, while avoiding expensive full-attention
computation over many layers. On reasoning benchmarks such as AIME and
GPQA-Diamond, DELTA matches or surpasses full attention in accuracy, while
reducing the number of attended tokens by up to $5\times$ and delivering
$1.5\times$ end-to-end speedup. Our results show that selective reuse of

Combined Representation and Generation with Diffusive State Predictive Information Bottleneck,10/10/2025,"Richard John, Yunrui Qiu, Lukas Herron, Pratyush Tiwary","Generative modeling becomes increasingly data-intensive in high-dimensional

agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,

STaTS: Structure-Aware Temporal Sequence Summarization via Statistical Window Merging,10/10/2025,"Disharee Bhowmick, Ranjith Ramanathan, Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur","Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+

demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves

the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order
to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive
environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that
explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their
reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which
trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search
trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions.
ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips
it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2,
we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further
strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both
outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts.
Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one
realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively
infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome

Geo-Aware Models for Stream Temperature Prediction across Different Spatial Regions and Scales,10/10/2025,"Shiyuan Luo, Runlong Yu, Shengyu Chen, Yingda Fan, Yiqun Xie, Yanhua Li, Xiaowei Jia","Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which

Failure Prediction at Runtime for Generative Robot Policies,10/10/2025,"Ralf Römer, Adrian Kobras, Luca Worbis, Angela P. Schoellig","Imitation learning (IL) with generative models, such as diffusion and flow

distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can
still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early
failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots
in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general
framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that
does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending
failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network
distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in
generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure
prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via
conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators,
aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER
across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure
modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures

is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that

requiring precise navigation to reach target locations. We show that a compact
glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its
centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and
reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow
the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend
sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature
of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our
results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$,
the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its
orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force,
which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high
viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its
centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that
results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller
than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the
inertial lift force at large Re$_p$.

We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry

Auto-scaling Continuous Memory for GUI Agent,10/10/2025,"Wenyi Wu, Kun Zhou, Ruoxin Yuan, Vivian Yu, Stephen Wang, Zhiting Hu, Biwei Huang","We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09038v1,,False
ReaLM: Residual Quantization Bridging Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Large Language Models,10/10/2025,"Wenbin Guo, Xin Wang, Jiaoyan Chen, Lingbing Guo, Zhao Li, Zirui Chen","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), offering strong reasoning and generalization
capabilities beyond traditional embedding-based approaches. However, existing
LLM-based methods often struggle to fully exploit structured semantic
representations, as the continuous embedding space of pretrained KG models is
fundamentally misaligned with the discrete token space of LLMs. This
discrepancy hinders effective semantic transfer and limits their performance.
To address this challenge, we propose ReaLM, a novel and effective framework
that bridges the gap between KG embeddings and LLM tokenization through the
mechanism of residual vector quantization. ReaLM discretizes pretrained KG
embeddings into compact code sequences and integrates them as learnable tokens
within the LLM vocabulary, enabling seamless fusion of symbolic and contextual
knowledge. Furthermore, we incorporate ontology-guided class constraints to
enforce semantic consistency, refining entity predictions based on class-level
compatibility. Extensive experiments on two widely used benchmark datasets
demonstrate that ReaLM achieves state-of-the-art performance, confirming its
effectiveness in aligning structured knowledge with large-scale language
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09711v1,,False
HiBBO: HiPPO-based Space Consistency for High-dimensional Bayesian Optimisation,10/10/2025,"Junyu Xuan, Wenlong Chen, Yingzhen Li","Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08965v1,,False
The Idola Tribus of AI: Large Language Models tend to perceive order where none exists,10/10/2025,"Shin-nosuke Ishikawa, Masato Todo, Taiki Ogihara, Hirotsugu Ohba","We present a tendency of large language models (LLMs) to generate absurd
patterns despite their clear inappropriateness in a simple task of identifying
regularities in number series. Several approaches have been proposed to apply
LLMs to complex real-world tasks, such as providing knowledge through
retrieval-augmented generation and executing multi-step tasks using AI agent
frameworks. However, these approaches rely on the logical consistency and
self-coherence of LLMs, making it crucial to evaluate these aspects and
consider potential countermeasures. To identify cases where LLMs fail to
maintain logical consistency, we conducted an experiment in which LLMs were
asked to explain the patterns in various integer sequences, ranging from
arithmetic sequences to randomly generated integer series. While the models
successfully identified correct patterns in arithmetic and geometric sequences,
they frequently over-recognized patterns that were inconsistent with the given
numbers when analyzing randomly generated series. This issue was observed even
in multi-step reasoning models, including OpenAI o3, o4-mini, and Google Gemini
2.5 Flash Preview Thinking. This tendency to perceive non-existent patterns can
be interpreted as the AI model equivalent of Idola Tribus and highlights
potential limitations in their capability for applied tasks requiring logical
reasoning, even when employing chain-of-thought reasoning mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.09709v1,,False
Mirror Flow Matching with Heavy-Tailed Priors for Generative Modeling on Convex Domains,10/10/2025,"Yunrui Guan, Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Shiqian Ma","We study generative modeling on convex domains using flow matching and mirror
maps, and identify two fundamental challenges. First, standard log-barrier
mirror maps induce heavy-tailed dual distributions, leading to ill-posed
dynamics. Second, coupling with Gaussian priors performs poorly when matching
heavy-tailed targets. To address these issues, we propose Mirror Flow Matching
based on a \emph{regularized mirror map} that controls dual tail behavior and
guarantees finite moments, together with coupling to a Student-$t$ prior that
aligns with heavy-tailed targets and stabilizes training. We provide
theoretical guarantees, including spatial Lipschitzness and temporal regularity
of the velocity field, Wasserstein convergence rates for flow matching with
Student-$t$ priors and primal-space guarantees for constrained generation,
under $\varepsilon$-accurate learned velocity fields. Empirically, our method
outperforms baselines in synthetic convex-domain simulations and achieves
competitive sample quality on real-world constrained generative tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08929v1,,False
Designing and Evaluating an AI-driven Immersive Multidisciplinary Simulation (AIMS) for Interprofessional Education,10/10/2025,"Ruijie Wang, Jie Lu, Bo Pei, Evonne Jones, Jamey Brinson, Timothy Brown","Interprofessional education has long relied on case studies and the use of
standardized patients to support teamwork, communication, and related
collaborative competencies among healthcare professionals. However, traditional
approaches are often limited by cost, scalability, and inability to mimic the
dynamic complexity of real-world clinical scenarios. To address these
challenges, we designed and developed AIMS (AI-Enhanced Immersive
Multidisciplinary Simulations), a virtual simulation that integrates a large
language model (Gemini-2.5-Flash), a Unity-based virtual environment engine,
and a character creation pipeline to support synchronized, multimodal
interactions between the user and the virtual patient. AIMS was designed to
enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies
among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal
usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional
roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted
conversations. Participants explored the patient's symptoms, social context,
and care needs. Usability issues were identified (e.g., audio routing, response
latency) and used to guide subsequent refinements. Findings in general suggest
that AIMS supports realistic, profession-specific and contextually appropriate
conversations. We discussed both technical and pedagogical innovations of AIMS
and concluded with future directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08891v1,,False
"ControlAudio: Tackling Text-Guided, Timing-Indicated and Intelligible Audio Generation via Progressive Diffusion Modeling",10/10/2025,"Yuxuan Jiang, Zehua Chen, Zeqian Ju, Yusheng Dai, Weibei Dou, Jun Zhu","Text-to-audio (TTA) generation with fine-grained control signals, e.g.,
precise timing control or intelligible speech content, has been explored in
recent works. However, constrained by data scarcity, their generation
performance at scale is still compromised. In this study, we recast
controllable TTA generation as a multi-task learning problem and introduce a
progressive diffusion modeling approach, ControlAudio. Our method adeptly fits
distributions conditioned on more fine-grained information, including text,
timing, and phoneme features, through a step-by-step strategy. First, we
propose a data construction method spanning both annotation and simulation,
augmenting condition information in the sequence of text, timing, and phoneme.
Second, at the model training stage, we pretrain a diffusion transformer (DiT)
on large-scale text-audio pairs, achieving scalable TTA generation, and then
incrementally integrate the timing and phoneme features with unified semantic
representations, expanding controllability. Finally, at the inference stage, we
propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more
fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling
nature of DiT. Extensive experiments show that ControlAudio achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of temporal accuracy and speech clarity,
significantly outperforming existing methods on both objective and subjective
evaluations. Demo samples are available at:
