"Quark: Real-time, High-resolution, and General Neural View Synthesis",25/11/2024,"John Flynn, Michael Broxton, Lukas Murmann, Lucy Chai, Matthew DuVall, Clément Godard, Kathryn Heal, Srinivas Kaza, Stephen Lombardi, Xuan Luo, Supreeth Achar, Kira Prabhu, Tiancheng Sun, Lynn Tsai, Ryan Overbeck","We present a novel neural algorithm for performing high-quality,
high-resolution, real-time novel view synthesis. From a sparse set of input RGB
images or videos streams, our network both reconstructs the 3D scene and
renders novel views at 1080p resolution at 30fps on an NVIDIA A100. Our
feed-forward network generalizes across a wide variety of datasets and scenes
and produces state-of-the-art quality for a real-time method. Our quality
approaches, and in some cases surpasses, the quality of some of the top offline
methods. In order to achieve these results we use a novel combination of
several key concepts, and tie them together into a cohesive and effective
algorithm. We build on previous works that represent the scene using
semi-transparent layers and use an iterative learned render-and-refine approach
to improve those layers. Instead of flat layers, our method reconstructs
layered depth maps (LDMs) that efficiently represent scenes with complex depth
and occlusions. The iterative update steps are embedded in a multi-scale,
UNet-style architecture to perform as much compute as possible at reduced
resolution. Within each update step, to better aggregate the information from
multiple input views, we use a specialized Transformer-based network component.
This allows the majority of the per-input image processing to be performed in
the input image space, as opposed to layer space, further increasing
efficiency. Finally, due to the real-time nature of our reconstruction and
rendering, we dynamically create and discard the internal 3D geometry for each
frame, generating the LDM for each view. Taken together, this produces a novel
and effective algorithm for view synthesis. Through extensive evaluation, we
demonstrate that we achieve state-of-the-art quality at real-time rates.

Exploring Discrete Flow Matching for 3D De Novo Molecule Generation,25/11/2024,"Ian Dunn, David R. Koes","Deep generative models that produce novel molecular structures have the
potential to facilitate chemical discovery. Flow matching is a recently
proposed generative modeling framework that has achieved impressive performance
on a variety of tasks including those on biomolecular structures. The seminal
flow matching framework was developed only for continuous data. However, de
novo molecular design tasks require generating discrete data such as atomic
elements or sequences of amino acid residues. Several discrete flow matching
methods have been proposed recently to address this gap. In this work we
benchmark the performance of existing discrete flow matching methods for 3D de
novo small molecule generation and provide explanations of their differing
behavior. As a result we present FlowMol-CTMC, an open-source model that
achieves state of the art performance for 3D de novo design with fewer
learnable parameters than existing methods. Additionally, we propose the use of
metrics that capture molecule quality beyond local chemical valency constraints
and towards higher-order structural motifs. These metrics show that even though
basic constraints are satisfied, the models tend to produce unusual and
potentially problematic functional groups outside of the training data
distribution. Code and trained models for reproducing this work are available

Inference-Time Policy Steering through Human Interactions,25/11/2024,"Yanwei Wang, Lirui Wang, Yilun Du, Balakumar Sundaralingam, Xuning Yang, Yu-Wei Chao, Claudia Perez-D'Arpino, Dieter Fox, Julie Shah","Generative policies trained with human demonstrations can autonomously
accomplish multimodal, long-horizon tasks. However, during inference, humans
are often removed from the policy execution loop, limiting the ability to guide
a pre-trained policy towards a specific sub-goal or trajectory shape among
multiple predictions. Naive human intervention may inadvertently exacerbate
distribution shift, leading to constraint violations or execution failures. To
better align policy output with human intent without inducing
out-of-distribution errors, we propose an Inference-Time Policy Steering (ITPS)
framework that leverages human interactions to bias the generative sampling
process, rather than fine-tuning the policy on interaction data. We evaluate
ITPS across three simulated and real-world benchmarks, testing three forms of
human interaction and associated alignment distance metrics. Among six sampling
strategies, our proposed stochastic sampling with diffusion policy achieves the
best trade-off between alignment and distribution shift. Videos are available

Imperceptible Adversarial Examples in the Physical World,25/11/2024,"Weilin Xu, Sebastian Szyller, Cory Cornelius, Luis Murillo Rojas, Marius Arvinte, Alvaro Velasquez, Jason Martin, Nageen Himayat","Adversarial examples in the digital domain against deep learning-based
computer vision models allow for perturbations that are imperceptible to human
eyes. However, producing similar adversarial examples in the physical world has
been difficult due to the non-differentiable image distortion functions in
visual sensing systems. The existing algorithms for generating physically
realizable adversarial examples often loosen their definition of adversarial
examples by allowing unbounded perturbations, resulting in obvious or even
strange visual patterns. In this work, we make adversarial examples
imperceptible in the physical world using a straight-through estimator (STE,
a.k.a. BPDA). We employ STE to overcome the non-differentiability -- applying
exact, non-differentiable distortions in the forward pass of the
backpropagation step, and using the identity function in the backward pass. Our
differentiable rendering extension to STE also enables imperceptible
adversarial patches in the physical world. Using printout photos, and
experiments in the CARLA simulator, we show that STE enables fast generation of
$\ell_\infty$ bounded adversarial examples despite the non-differentiable
distortions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work demonstrating
imperceptible adversarial examples bounded by small $\ell_\infty$ norms in the
physical world that force zero classification accuracy in the global
perturbation threat model and cause near-zero ($4.22\%$) AP50 in object
detection in the patch perturbation threat model. We urge the community to
re-evaluate the threat of adversarial examples in the physical world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16622v1,,False
"Pricing Multi-strike Quanto Call Options on Multiple Assets with Stochastic Volatility, Correlation, and Exchange Rates",25/11/2024,"Boris Ter-Avanesov, Gunter A. Meissner","Quanto options allow the buyer to exchange the foreign currency payoff into
the domestic currency at a fixed exchange rate. We investigate quanto options
with multiple underlying assets valued in different foreign currencies each
with a different strike price in the payoff function. We carry out a
comparative performance analysis of different stochastic volatility (SV),
stochastic correlation (SC), and stochastic exchange rate (SER) models to
determine the best combination of these models for Monte Carlo (MC) simulation
pricing. In addition, we test the performance of all model variants with
constant correlation as a benchmark. We find that a combination of GARCH-Jump
SV, Weibull SC, and Ornstein Uhlenbeck (OU) SER performs best. In addition, we
analyze different discretization schemes and their results. In our simulations,
the Milstein scheme yields the best balance between execution times and lower
standard deviations of price estimates. Furthermore, we find that incorporating
mean reversion into stochastic correlation and stochastic FX rate modeling is
beneficial for MC simulation pricing. We improve the accuracy of our
simulations by implementing antithetic variates variance reduction. Finally, we
derive the correlation risk parameters Cora and Gora in our framework so that
correlation hedging of quanto options can be performed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16617v1,,False
Naive Algorithmic Collusion: When Do Bandit Learners Cooperate and When Do They Compete?,25/11/2024,"Connor Douglas, Foster Provost, Arun Sundararajan","Algorithmic agents are used in a variety of competitive decision settings,
notably in making pricing decisions in contexts that range from online retail
to residential home rentals. Business managers, algorithm designers, legal
scholars, and regulators alike are all starting to consider the ramifications
of ""algorithmic collusion."" We study the emergent behavior of multi-armed
bandit machine learning algorithms used in situations where agents are
competing, but they have no information about the strategic interaction they
are engaged in. Using a general-form repeated Prisoner's Dilemma game, agents
engage in online learning with no prior model of game structure and no
knowledge of competitors' states or actions (e.g., no observation of competing
prices). We show that these context-free bandits, with no knowledge of
opponents' choices or outcomes, still will consistently learn collusive
behavior - what we call ""naive collusion."" We primarily study this system
through an analytical model and examine perturbations to the model through
simulations.
  Our findings have several notable implications for regulators. First, calls
to limit algorithms from conditioning on competitors' prices are insufficient
to prevent algorithmic collusion. This is a direct result of collusion arising
even in the naive setting. Second, symmetry in algorithms can increase
collusion potential. This highlights a new, simple mechanism for
""hub-and-spoke"" algorithmic collusion. A central distributor need not imbue its
algorithm with supra-competitive tendencies for apparent collusion to arise; it
can simply arise by using certain (common) machine learning algorithms.
Finally, we highlight that collusive outcomes depend starkly on the specific
algorithm being used, and we highlight market and algorithmic conditions under
which it will be unknown a priori whether collusion occurs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16574v1,,False
Enhancing Few-Shot Learning with Integrated Data and GAN Model Approaches,25/11/2024,"Yinqiu Feng, Aoran Shen, Jiacheng Hu, Yingbin Liang, Shiru Wang, Junliang Du","This paper presents an innovative approach to enhancing few-shot learning by
integrating data augmentation with model fine-tuning in a framework designed to
tackle the challenges posed by small-sample data. Recognizing the critical
limitations of traditional machine learning models that require large
datasets-especially in fields such as drug discovery, target recognition, and
malicious traffic detection-this study proposes a novel strategy that leverages
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and advanced optimization techniques to
improve model performance with limited data. Specifically, the paper addresses
the noise and bias issues introduced by data augmentation methods, contrasting
them with model-based approaches, such as fine-tuning and metric learning,
which rely heavily on related datasets. By combining Markov Chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) sampling and discriminative model ensemble strategies within a GAN
framework, the proposed model adjusts generative and discriminative
distributions to simulate a broader range of relevant data. Furthermore, it
employs MHLoss and a reparameterized GAN ensemble to enhance stability and
accelerate convergence, ultimately leading to improved classification
performance on small-sample images and structured datasets. Results confirm
that the MhERGAN algorithm developed in this research is highly effective for
few-shot learning, offering a practical solution that bridges data scarcity
with high-performing model adaptability and generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16567v1,,False
Generating Out-Of-Distribution Scenarios Using Language Models,25/11/2024,"Erfan Aasi, Phat Nguyen, Shiva Sreeram, Guy Rosman, Sertac Karaman, Daniela Rus","The deployment of autonomous vehicles controlled by machine learning
techniques requires extensive testing in diverse real-world environments,
robust handling of edge cases and out-of-distribution scenarios, and
comprehensive safety validation to ensure that these systems can navigate
safely and effectively under unpredictable conditions. Addressing
Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) driving scenarios is essential for enhancing safety,
as OOD scenarios help validate the reliability of the models within the
vehicle's autonomy stack. However, generating OOD scenarios is challenging due
to their long-tailed distribution and rarity in urban driving dataset.
Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in autonomous
driving, particularly for their zero-shot generalization and common-sense
reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we leverage these LLM strengths to
introduce a framework for generating diverse OOD driving scenarios. Our
approach uses LLMs to construct a branching tree, where each branch represents
a unique OOD scenario. These scenarios are then simulated in the CARLA
simulator using an automated framework that aligns scene augmentation with the
corresponding textual descriptions. We evaluate our framework through extensive
simulations, and assess its performance via a diversity metric that measures
the richness of the scenarios. Additionally, we introduce a new ""OOD-ness""
metric, which quantifies how much the generated scenarios deviate from typical
urban driving conditions. Furthermore, we explore the capacity of modern
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and safely navigate through the
simulated OOD scenarios. Our findings offer valuable insights into the
reliability of language models in addressing OOD scenarios within the context
of urban driving.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16554v1,,False
Multi-Resolution Generative Modeling of Human Motion from Limited Data,25/11/2024,"David Eduardo Moreno-Villamarín, Anna Hilsmann, Peter Eisert","We present a generative model that learns to synthesize human motion from
limited training sequences. Our framework provides conditional generation and
blending across multiple temporal resolutions. The model adeptly captures human
motion patterns by integrating skeletal convolution layers and a multi-scale
architecture. Our model contains a set of generative and adversarial networks,
along with embedding modules, each tailored for generating motions at specific
frame rates while exerting control over their content and details. Notably, our
approach also extends to the synthesis of co-speech gestures, demonstrating its
ability to generate synchronized gestures from speech inputs, even with limited
paired data. Through direct synthesis of SMPL pose parameters, our approach
avoids test-time adjustments to fit human body meshes. Experimental results
showcase our model's ability to achieve extensive coverage of training
examples, while generating diverse motions, as indicated by local and global
diversity metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16498v1,10.1145/3697294.3697309,False
Unsupervised Event Outlier Detection in Continuous Time,25/11/2024,"Somjit Nath, Yik Chau Lui, Siqi Liu","Event sequence data record the occurrences of events in continuous time.
Event sequence forecasting based on temporal point processes (TPPs) has been
extensively studied, but outlier or anomaly detection, especially without any
supervision from humans, is still underexplored. In this work, we develop, to
the best our knowledge, the first unsupervised outlier detection approach to
detecting abnormal events. Our novel unsupervised outlier detection framework
is based on ideas from generative adversarial networks (GANs) and reinforcement
learning (RL). We train a 'generator' that corrects outliers in the data with a
'discriminator' that learns to discriminate the corrected data from the real
data, which may contain outliers. A key insight is that if the generator made a
mistake in the correction, it would generate anomalies that are different from
the anomalies in the real data, so it serves as data augmentation for the
discriminator learning. Different from typical GAN-based outlier detection
approaches, our method employs the generator to detect outliers in an online
manner. The experimental results show that our method can detect event outliers
more accurately than the state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16427v1,,False
Machine Learning for the Digital Typhoon Dataset: Extensions to Multiple Basins and New Developments in Representations and Tasks,25/11/2024,"Asanobu Kitamoto, Erwan Dzik, Gaspar Faure","This paper presents the Digital Typhoon Dataset V2, a new version of the
longest typhoon satellite image dataset for 40+ years aimed at benchmarking
machine learning models for long-term spatio-temporal data. The new addition in
Dataset V2 is tropical cyclone data from the southern hemisphere, in addition
to the northern hemisphere data in Dataset V1. Having data from two hemispheres
allows us to ask new research questions about regional differences across
basins and hemispheres. We also discuss new developments in representations and
tasks of the dataset. We first introduce a self-supervised learning framework
for representation learning. Combined with the LSTM model, we discuss
performance on intensity forecasting and extra-tropical transition forecasting
tasks. We then propose new tasks, such as the typhoon center estimation task.
We show that an object detection-based model performs better for stronger
typhoons. Finally, we study how machine learning models can generalize across
basins and hemispheres, by training the model on the northern hemisphere data
and testing it on the southern hemisphere data. The dataset is publicly

across various healthcare areas. However, large-scale modeling of in-hospital
time series data - such as vital signs, lab results, and treatments in critical
care - remains underexplored. Existing datasets are relatively small, but
combining them can enhance patient diversity and improve model robustness. To
effectively utilize these combined datasets for large-scale modeling, it is
essential to address the distribution shifts caused by varying treatment
policies, necessitating the harmonization of treatment variables across the
different datasets. This work aims to establish a foundation for training
large-scale multi-variate time series models on critical care data and to
provide a benchmark for machine learning models in transfer learning across
hospitals to study and address distribution shift challenges. We introduce a

One Diffusion to Generate Them All,25/11/2024,"Duong H. Le, Tuan Pham, Sangho Lee, Christopher Clark, Aniruddha Kembhavi, Stephan Mandt, Ranjay Krishna, Jiasen Lu","We introduce OneDiffusion, a versatile, large-scale diffusion model that
seamlessly supports bidirectional image synthesis and understanding across
diverse tasks. It enables conditional generation from inputs such as text,
depth, pose, layout, and semantic maps, while also handling tasks like image
deblurring, upscaling, and reverse processes such as depth estimation and
segmentation. Additionally, OneDiffusion allows for multi-view generation,
camera pose estimation, and instant personalization using sequential image
inputs. Our model takes a straightforward yet effective approach by treating
all tasks as frame sequences with varying noise scales during training,
allowing any frame to act as a conditioning image at inference time. Our
unified training framework removes the need for specialized architectures,
supports scalable multi-task training, and adapts smoothly to any resolution,
enhancing both generalization and scalability. Experimental results demonstrate

Flow Annealed Importance Sampling Bootstrap meets Differentiable Particle Physics,25/11/2024,"Annalena Kofler, Vincent Stimper, Mikhail Mikhasenko, Michael Kagan, Lukas Heinrich","High-energy physics requires the generation of large numbers of simulated
data samples from complex but analytically tractable distributions called
matrix elements. Surrogate models, such as normalizing flows, are gaining
popularity for this task due to their computational efficiency. We adopt an
approach based on Flow Annealed importance sampling Bootstrap (FAB) that
evaluates the differentiable target density during training and helps avoid the

comparison to other methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16234v1,,False
SALOVA: Segment-Augmented Long Video Assistant for Targeted Retrieval and Routing in Long-Form Video Analysis,25/11/2024,"Junho Kim, Hyunjun Kim, Hosu Lee, Yong Man Ro","Despite advances in Large Multi-modal Models, applying them to long and
untrimmed video content remains challenging due to limitations in context
length and substantial memory overhead. These constraints often lead to
significant information loss and reduced relevance in the model responses. With
the exponential growth of video data across web platforms, understanding
long-form video is crucial for advancing generalized intelligence. In this
paper, we introduce SALOVA: Segment-Augmented LOng Video Assistant, a novel
video-LLM framework designed to enhance the comprehension of lengthy video
content through targeted retrieval process. We address two main challenges to
achieve it: (i) We present the SceneWalk dataset, a high-quality collection of
87.8K long videos, each densely captioned at the segment level to enable models
to capture scene continuity and maintain rich descriptive context. (ii) We
develop robust architectural designs integrating dynamic routing mechanism and
spatio-temporal projector to efficiently retrieve and process relevant video
segments based on user queries. Our framework mitigates the limitations of
current video-LMMs by allowing for precise identification and retrieval of
relevant video segments in response to queries, thereby improving the
contextual relevance of the generated responses. Through extensive experiments,
SALOVA demonstrates enhanced capability in processing complex long-form videos,
showing significant capability to maintain contextual integrity across extended

VICON: Vision In-Context Operator Networks for Multi-Physics Fluid Dynamics Prediction,25/11/2024,"Yadi Cao, Yuxuan Liu, Liu Yang, Rose Yu, Hayden Schaeffer, Stanley Osher","In-Context Operator Networks (ICONs) are models that learn operators across
different types of PDEs using a few-shot, in-context approach. Although they
show successful generalization to various PDEs, existing methods treat each

processing dense data, limiting their application in higher spatial dimensions.
In this work, we propose Vision In-Context Operator Networks (VICON),
incorporating a vision transformer architecture that efficiently processes 2D
functions through patch-wise operations. We evaluated our method on three fluid
dynamics datasets, demonstrating both superior performance (reducing scaled
$L^2$ error by $40\%$ and $61.6\%$ for two benchmark datasets for compressible
flows, respectively) and computational efficiency (requiring only one-third of
the inference time per frame) in long-term rollout predictions compared to the
current state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model with fixed timestep

From Dashcam Videos to Driving Simulations: Stress Testing Automated Vehicles against Rare Events,25/11/2024,"Yan Miao, Georgios Fainekos, Bardh Hoxha, Hideki Okamoto, Danil Prokhorov, Sayan Mitra","Testing Automated Driving Systems (ADS) in simulation with realistic driving
scenarios is important for verifying their performance. However, converting
real-world driving videos into simulation scenarios is a significant challenge
due to the complexity of interpreting high-dimensional video data and the
time-consuming nature of precise manual scenario reconstruction. In this work,
we propose a novel framework that automates the conversion of real-world car
crash videos into detailed simulation scenarios for ADS testing. Our approach
leverages prompt-engineered Video Language Models(VLM) to transform dashcam
footage into SCENIC scripts, which define the environment and driving behaviors
in the CARLA simulator, enabling the generation of realistic simulation
scenarios. Importantly, rather than solely aiming for one-to-one scenario
reconstruction, our framework focuses on capturing the essential driving
behaviors from the original video while offering flexibility in parameters such
as weather or road conditions to facilitate search-based testing. Additionally,
we introduce a similarity metric that helps iteratively refine the generated
scenario through feedback by comparing key features of driving behaviors
between the real and simulated videos. Our preliminary results demonstrate
substantial time efficiency, finishing the real-to-sim conversion in minutes
