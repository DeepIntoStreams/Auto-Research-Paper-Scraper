Parameter-Efficient Conditioning for Material Generalization in Graph-Based Simulators,07/11/2025,"Naveen Raj Manoharan, Hassan Iqbal, Krishna Kumar","Graph network-based simulators (GNS) have demonstrated strong potential for
learning particle-based physics (such as fluids, deformable solids, and
granular flows) while generalizing to unseen geometries due to their inherent
inductive biases. However, existing models are typically trained for a single
material type and fail to generalize across distinct constitutive behaviors,
limiting their applicability in real-world engineering settings. Using granular
flows as a running example, we propose a parameter-efficient conditioning
mechanism that makes the GNS model adaptive to material parameters. We identify
that sensitivity to material properties is concentrated in the early
message-passing (MP) layers, a finding we link to the local nature of
constitutive models (e.g., Mohr-Coulomb) and their effects on information
propagation. We empirically validate this by showing that fine-tuning only the
first few (1-5) of 10 MP layers of a pretrained model achieves comparable test
performance as compared to fine-tuning the entire network. Building on this
insight, we propose a parameter-efficient Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM)
conditioning mechanism designed to specifically target these early layers. This
approach produces accurate long-term rollouts on unseen, interpolated, or
moderately extrapolated values (e.g., up to 2.5 degrees for friction angle and
0.25 kPa for cohesion) when trained exclusively on as few as 12 short
simulation trajectories from new materials, representing a 5-fold data
reduction compared to a baseline multi-task learning method. Finally, we
validate the model's utility by applying it to an inverse problem, successfully
identifying unknown cohesion parameters from trajectory data. This approach
enables the use of GNS in inverse design and closed-loop control tasks where
material properties are treated as design variables.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05456v1,,False
Diffusion-Based Electromagnetic Inverse Design of Scattering Structured Media,07/11/2025,"Mikhail Tsukerman, Konstantin Grotov, Pavel Ginzburg","We present a conditional diffusion model for electromagnetic inverse design
that generates structured media geometries directly from target differential
scattering cross-section profiles, bypassing expensive iterative optimization.
Our 1D U-Net architecture with Feature-wise Linear Modulation learns to map
desired angular scattering patterns to 2x2 dielectric sphere structure,
naturally handling the non-uniqueness of inverse problems by sampling diverse
valid designs. Trained on 11,000 simulated metasurfaces, the model achieves
median MPE below 19% on unseen targets (best: 1.39%), outperforming CMA-ES
evolutionary optimization while reducing design time from hours to seconds.
These results demonstrate that employing diffusion models is promising for
advancing electromagnetic inverse design research, potentially enabling rapid
exploration of complex metasurface architectures and accelerating the
development of next-generation photonic and wireless communication systems. The
code is publicly available at

Embedding-Space Data Augmentation to Prevent Membership Inference Attacks in Clinical Time Series Forecasting,07/11/2025,"Marius Fracarolli, Michael Staniek, Stefan Riezler","Balancing strong privacy guarantees with high predictive performance is
critical for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks involving Electronic Health
Records (EHR). In this study, we explore how data augmentation can mitigate
Membership Inference Attacks (MIA) on TSF models. We show that retraining with
synthetic data can substantially reduce the effectiveness of loss-based MIAs by
reducing the attacker's true-positive to false-positive ratio. The key
challenge is generating synthetic samples that closely resemble the original
training data to confuse the attacker, while also introducing enough novelty to
enhance the model's ability to generalize to unseen data. We examine multiple
augmentation strategies - Zeroth-Order Optimization (ZOO), a variant of ZOO
constrained by Principal Component Analysis (ZOO-PCA), and MixUp - to
strengthen model resilience without sacrificing accuracy. Our experimental
results show that ZOO-PCA yields the best reductions in TPR/FPR ratio for MIA
attacks without sacrificing performance on test data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05289v1,,False
Integrating Score-Based Diffusion Models with Machine Learning-Enhanced Localization for Advanced Data Assimilation in Geological Carbon Storage,07/11/2025,"Gabriel Serrão Seabra, Nikolaj T. Mücke, Vinicius Luiz Santos Silva, Alexandre A. Emerick, Denis Voskov, Femke Vossepoel","Accurate characterization of subsurface heterogeneity is important for the
safe and effective implementation of geological carbon storage (GCS) projects.
This paper explores how machine learning methods can enhance data assimilation
for GCS with a framework that integrates score-based diffusion models with
machine learning-enhanced localization in channelized reservoirs during CO$_2$
injection. We employ a machine learning-enhanced localization framework that
uses large ensembles ($N_s = 5000$) with permeabilities generated by the
diffusion model and states computed by simple ML algorithms to improve
covariance estimation for the Ensemble Smoother with Multiple Data Assimilation
(ESMDA). We apply ML algorithms to a prior ensemble of channelized permeability
fields, generated with the geostatistical model FLUVSIM. Our approach is
applied on a CO$_2$ injection scenario simulated using the Delft Advanced
Research Terra Simulator (DARTS). Our ML-based localization maintains
significantly more ensemble variance than when localization is not applied,
while achieving comparable data-matching quality. This framework has practical
implications for GCS projects, helping improve the reliability of uncertainty
quantification for risk assessment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05266v1,,False
An End-to-End Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones,07/11/2025,"Taihelong Zeng, Yun Lin, Yuhe Shi, Yan Li, Zhiqing Wei, Xuanru Ji","The emergence of truck-drone collaborative systems in last-mile logistics has
positioned the Traveling Salesman Problem with Drones (TSP-D) as a pivotal
extension of classical routing optimization, where synchronized vehicle
coordination promises substantial operational efficiency and reduced
environmental impact, yet introduces NP-hard combinatorial complexity beyond
the reach of conventional optimization paradigms. Deep reinforcement learning
offers a theoretically grounded framework to address TSP-D's inherent
challenges through self-supervised policy learning and adaptive
decision-making. This study proposes a hierarchical Actor-Critic deep
reinforcement learning framework for solving the TSP-D problem. The
architecture consists of two primary components: a Transformer-inspired encoder
and an efficient Minimal Gated Unit decoder. The encoder incorporates a novel,
optimized k-nearest neighbors sparse attention mechanism specifically for
focusing on relevant spatial relationships, further enhanced by the integration
of global node features. The Minimal Gated Unit decoder processes these encoded
representations to efficiently generate solution sequences. The entire
framework operates within an asynchronous advantage actor-critic paradigm.
Experimental results show that, on benchmark TSP-D instances of various scales
(N=10 to 100), the proposed model can obtain competitive or even superior
solutions in shorter average computation times compared to high-performance
heuristic algorithms and existing reinforcement learning methods. Moreover,
compared to advanced reinforcement learning algorithm benchmarks, the proposed
framework significantly reduces the total training time required while
achieving superior final performance, highlighting its notable advantage in
training efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05265v1,,False
No One-Model-Fits-All: Uncovering Spatio-Temporal Forecasting Trade-offs with Graph Neural Networks and Foundation Models,07/11/2025,"Ragini Gupta, Naman Raina, Bo Chen, Li Chen, Claudiu Danilov, Josh Eckhardt, Keyshla Bernard, Klara Nahrstedt","Modern IoT deployments for environmental sensing produce high volume
spatiotemporal data to support downstream tasks such as forecasting, typically
powered by machine learning models. While existing filtering and strategic
deployment techniques optimize collected data volume at the edge, they overlook
how variations in sampling frequencies and spatial coverage affect downstream
model performance. In many forecasting models, incorporating data from
additional sensors denoise predictions by providing broader spatial contexts.
This interplay between sampling frequency, spatial coverage and different
forecasting model architectures remain underexplored. This work presents a
systematic study of forecasting models - classical models (VAR), neural
networks (GRU, Transformer), spatio-temporal graph neural networks (STGNNs),
and time series foundation models (TSFMs: Chronos Moirai, TimesFM) under
varying spatial sensor nodes density and sampling intervals using real-world
temperature data in a wireless sensor network. Our results show that STGNNs are
effective when sensor deployments are sparse and sampling rate is moderate,
leveraging spatial correlations via encoded graph structure to compensate for
limited coverage. In contrast, TSFMs perform competitively at high frequencies
but degrade when spatial coverage from neighboring sensors is reduced.
Crucially, the multivariate TSFM Moirai outperforms all models by natively
learning cross-sensor dependencies. These findings offer actionable insights
for building efficient forecasting pipelines in spatio-temporal systems. All
code for model configurations, training, dataset, and logs are open-sourced for

SmartSecChain-SDN: A Blockchain-Integrated Intelligent Framework for Secure and Efficient Software-Defined Networks,07/11/2025,"Azhar Hussain Mozumder, M. John Basha, Chayapathi A. R","With more and more existing networks being transformed to Software-Defined
Networking (SDN), they need to be more secure and demand smarter ways of
traffic control. This work, SmartSecChain-SDN, is a platform that combines
machine learning based intrusion detection, blockchain-based storage of logs,
and application-awareness-based priority in SDN networks. To detect network
intrusions in a real-time, precision and low-false positives setup, the
framework utilizes the application of advanced machine learning algorithms,
namely Random Forest, XGBoost, CatBoost, and CNN-BiLSTM. SmartSecChain-SDN is
based on the Hyperledger Fabric, which is a permissioned blockchain technology,
to provide secure, scalable, and privacy-preserving storage and, thus,
guarantee that the Intrusion Detection System (IDS) records cannot be altered
and can be analyzed comprehensively. The system also has Quality of Service
(QoS) rules and traffic shaping based on applications, which enables
prioritization of critical services, such as VoIP, video conferencing, and
business applications, as well as de-prioritization of non-essential traffic,
such as downloads and updates. Mininet can simulate real-time SDN scenarios
because it is used to prototype whole architectures. It is also compatible with
controllers OpenDaylight and Ryu. It has tested the framework using the InSDN
dataset and proved that it can identify different kinds of cyberattacks and
handle bandwidth allocation efficiently under circumstances of resource
constraints. SmartSecChain-SDN comprehensively addresses SDN system protection,
securing and enhancing. The proposed study offers an innovative, extensible way
to improve cybersecurity, regulatory compliance, and the administration of
next-generation programmable networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05156v1,10.14445/23488549/IJECE-V12I10P117,False
Estimating Bidirectional Causal Effects with Large Scale Online Kernel Learning,07/11/2025,Masahiro Tanaka,"In this study, a scalable online kernel learning framework is proposed for
estimating bidirectional causal effects in systems characterized by mutual
dependence and heteroskedasticity. Traditional causal inference often focuses
on unidirectional effects, overlooking the common bidirectional relationships
in real-world phenomena. Building on heteroskedasticity-based identification,
the proposed method integrates a quasi-maximum likelihood estimator for
simultaneous equation models with large scale online kernel learning. It
employs random Fourier feature approximations to flexibly model nonlinear
conditional means and variances, while an adaptive online gradient descent
algorithm ensures computational efficiency for streaming and high-dimensional
data. Results from extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves superior accuracy and stability than single equation and polynomial
approximation baselines, exhibiting lower bias and root mean squared error
across various data-generating processes. These results confirm that the
proposed approach effectively captures complex bidirectional causal effects
with near-linear computational scaling. By combining econometric identification
with modern machine learning techniques, the proposed framework offers a
practical, scalable, and theoretically grounded solution for large scale causal
inference in natural/social science, policy making, business, and industrial
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.05050v1,,False
Carbon Price Forecasting with Structural Breaks: A Comparative Study of Deep Learning Models,07/11/2025,"Runsheng Ren, Jing Li, Yanxiu Li, Shixun Huang, Jun Shen, Wanqing Li, John Le, Sheng Wang","Accurately forecasting carbon prices is essential for informed energy market
decision-making, guiding sustainable energy planning, and supporting effective
decarbonization strategies. However, it remains challenging due to structural
breaks and high-frequency noise caused by frequent policy interventions and
market shocks. Existing studies, including the most recent baseline approaches,
have attempted to incorporate breakpoints but often treat denoising and
modeling as separate processes and lack systematic evaluation across advanced
deep learning architectures, limiting the robustness and the generalization
capability. To address these gaps, this paper proposes a comprehensive hybrid
framework that integrates structural break detection (Bai-Perron, ICSS, and
PELT algorithms), wavelet signal denoising, and three state-of-the-art deep
learning models (LSTM, GRU, and TCN). Using European Union Allowance (EUA) spot
prices from 2007 to 2024 and exogenous features such as energy prices and
policy indicators, the framework constructs univariate and multivariate
datasets for comparative evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that our
proposed PELT-WT-TCN achieves the highest prediction accuracy, reducing
forecasting errors by 22.35% in RMSE and 18.63% in MAE compared to the
state-of-the-art baseline model (Breakpoints with Wavelet and LSTM), and by
70.55% in RMSE and 74.42% in MAE compared to the original LSTM without
decomposition from the same baseline study. These findings underscore the value
of integrating structural awareness and multiscale decomposition into deep
learning architectures to enhance accuracy and interpretability in carbon price
forecasting and other nonstationary financial time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04988v1,,False
Less Is More: Generating Time Series with LLaMA-Style Autoregression in Simple Factorized Latent Spaces,07/11/2025,"Siyuan Li, Yifan Sun, Lei Cheng, Lewen Wang, Yang Liu, Weiqing Liu, Jianlong Li, Jiang Bian, Shikai Fang","Generative models for multivariate time series are essential for data
augmentation, simulation, and privacy preservation, yet current
state-of-the-art diffusion-based approaches are slow and limited to
fixed-length windows. We propose FAR-TS, a simple yet effective framework that
combines disentangled factorization with an autoregressive Transformer over a
discrete, quantized latent space to generate time series. Each time series is
decomposed into a data-adaptive basis that captures static cross-channel
correlations and temporal coefficients that are vector-quantized into discrete
tokens. A LLaMA-style autoregressive Transformer then models these token
sequences, enabling fast and controllable generation of sequences with
arbitrary length. Owing to its streamlined design, FAR-TS achieves
orders-of-magnitude faster generation than Diffusion-TS while preserving
cross-channel correlations and an interpretable latent space, enabling
high-quality and flexible time series synthesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04973v1,,False
Too Good to be Bad: On the Failure of LLMs to Role-Play Villains,07/11/2025,"Zihao Yi, Qingxuan Jiang, Ruotian Ma, Xingyu Chen, Qu Yang, Mengru Wang, Fanghua Ye, Ying Shen, Zhaopeng Tu, Xiaolong Li, Linus","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly tasked with creative
generation, including the simulation of fictional characters. However, their
ability to portray non-prosocial, antagonistic personas remains largely
unexamined. We hypothesize that the safety alignment of modern LLMs creates a
fundamental conflict with the task of authentically role-playing morally
ambiguous or villainous characters. To investigate this, we introduce the Moral
RolePlay benchmark, a new dataset featuring a four-level moral alignment scale
and a balanced test set for rigorous evaluation. We task state-of-the-art LLMs
with role-playing characters from moral paragons to pure villains. Our
large-scale evaluation reveals a consistent, monotonic decline in role-playing
fidelity as character morality decreases. We find that models struggle most
with traits directly antithetical to safety principles, such as ``Deceitful''
and ``Manipulative'', often substituting nuanced malevolence with superficial
aggression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that general chatbot proficiency is a
poor predictor of villain role-playing ability, with highly safety-aligned
models performing particularly poorly. Our work provides the first systematic
evidence of this critical limitation, highlighting a key tension between model
safety and creative fidelity. Our benchmark and findings pave the way for
developing more nuanced, context-aware alignment methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04962v1,,False
DeepForgeSeal: Latent Space-Driven Semi-Fragile Watermarking for Deepfake Detection Using Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement Learning,07/11/2025,"Tharindu Fernando, Clinton Fookes, Sridha Sridharan","Rapid advances in generative AI have led to increasingly realistic deepfakes,
posing growing challenges for law enforcement and public trust. Existing
passive deepfake detectors struggle to keep pace, largely due to their
dependence on specific forgery artifacts, which limits their ability to
generalize to new deepfake types. Proactive deepfake detection using watermarks
has emerged to address the challenge of identifying high-quality synthetic
media. However, these methods often struggle to balance robustness against
benign distortions with sensitivity to malicious tampering. This paper
introduces a novel deep learning framework that harnesses high-dimensional
latent space representations and the Multi-Agent Adversarial Reinforcement
Learning (MAARL) paradigm to develop a robust and adaptive watermarking
approach. Specifically, we develop a learnable watermark embedder that operates
in the latent space, capturing high-level image semantics, while offering
precise control over message encoding and extraction. The MAARL paradigm
empowers the learnable watermarking agent to pursue an optimal balance between
robustness and fragility by interacting with a dynamic curriculum of benign and
malicious image manipulations simulated by an adversarial attacker agent.
Comprehensive evaluations on the CelebA and CelebA-HQ benchmarks reveal that
our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
improvements of over 4.5% on CelebA and more than 5.3% on CelebA-HQ under
challenging manipulation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04949v1,,False
