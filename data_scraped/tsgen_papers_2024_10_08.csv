Regression Conformal Prediction under Bias,07/10/2024,"Matt Y. Cheung, Tucker J. Netherton, Laurence E. Court, Ashok Veeraraghavan, Guha Balakrishnan","Uncertainty quantification is crucial to account for the imperfect
predictions of machine learning algorithms for high-impact applications.
Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for uncertainty
quantification that generates calibrated prediction intervals with valid
coverage. In this work, we study how CP intervals are affected by bias - the
systematic deviation of a prediction from ground truth values - a phenomenon
prevalent in many real-world applications. We investigate the influence of bias
on interval lengths of two different types of adjustments -- symmetric
adjustments, the conventional method where both sides of the interval are
adjusted equally, and asymmetric adjustments, a more flexible method where the
interval can be adjusted unequally in positive or negative directions. We
present theoretical and empirical analyses characterizing how symmetric and
asymmetric adjustments impact the ""tightness"" of CP intervals for regression
tasks. Specifically for absolute residual and quantile-based non-conformity
scores, we prove: 1) the upper bound of symmetrically adjusted interval lengths
increases by $2|b|$ where $b$ is a globally applied scalar value representing
bias, 2) asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are not affected by bias, and
3) conditions when asymmetrically adjusted interval lengths are guaranteed to
be smaller than symmetric ones. Our analyses suggest that even if predictions
exhibit significant drift from ground truth values, asymmetrically adjusted
intervals are still able to maintain the same tightness and validity of
intervals as if the drift had never happened, while symmetric ones
significantly inflate the lengths. We demonstrate our theoretical results with
two real-world prediction tasks: sparse-view computed tomography (CT)
reconstruction and time-series weather forecasting. Our work paves the way for
more bias-robust machine learning systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05263v1,,False
LADEV: A Language-Driven Testing and Evaluation Platform for Vision-Language-Action Models in Robotic Manipulation,07/10/2024,"Zhijie Wang, Zhehua Zhou, Jiayang Song, Yuheng Huang, Zhan Shu, Lei Ma","Building on the advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision
Language Models (VLMs), recent research has introduced Vision-Language-Action
(VLA) models as an integrated solution for robotic manipulation tasks. These
models take camera images and natural language task instructions as input and
directly generate control actions for robots to perform specified tasks,
greatly improving both decision-making capabilities and interaction with human
users. However, the data-driven nature of VLA models, combined with their lack
of interpretability, makes the assurance of their effectiveness and robustness
a challenging task. This highlights the need for a reliable testing and
evaluation platform. For this purpose, in this work, we propose LADEV, a
comprehensive and efficient platform specifically designed for evaluating VLA
models. We first present a language-driven approach that automatically
generates simulation environments from natural language inputs, mitigating the
need for manual adjustments and significantly improving testing efficiency.
Then, to further assess the influence of language input on the VLA models, we
implement a paraphrase mechanism that produces diverse natural language task
instructions for testing. Finally, to expedite the evaluation process, we
introduce a batch-style method for conducting large-scale testing of VLA
models. Using LADEV, we conducted experiments on several state-of-the-art VLA
models, demonstrating its effectiveness as a tool for evaluating these models.
Our results showed that LADEV not only enhances testing efficiency but also
establishes a solid baseline for evaluating VLA models, paving the way for the
development of more intelligent and advanced robotic systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05191v1,,False
A Simulation-Free Deep Learning Approach to Stochastic Optimal Control,07/10/2024,"Mengjian Hua, Matthieu Laurière, Eric Vanden-Eijnden","We propose a simulation-free algorithm for the solution of generic problems
in stochastic optimal control (SOC). Unlike existing methods, our approach does
not require the solution of an adjoint problem, but rather leverages Girsanov
theorem to directly calculate the gradient of the SOC objective on-policy. This
allows us to speed up the optimization of control policies parameterized by
neural networks since it completely avoids the expensive back-propagation step
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in the Neural SDE
framework. In particular, it enables us to solve SOC problems in high dimension
and on long time horizons. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in
various domains of applications, including standard stochastic optimal control
problems, sampling from unnormalized distributions via construction of a
Schr\""odinger-F\""ollmer process, and fine-tuning of pre-trained diffusion
models. In all cases our method is shown to outperform the existing methods in
both the computing time and memory efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05163v1,,False
SparsePO: Controlling Preference Alignment of LLMs via Sparse Token Masks,07/10/2024,"Fenia Christopoulou, Ronald Cardenas, Gerasimos Lampouras, Haitham Bou-Ammar, Jun Wang","Preference Optimization (PO) has proven an effective step for aligning
language models to human-desired behaviors. Current variants, following the
offline Direct Preference Optimization objective, have focused on a strict
setting where all tokens are contributing signals of KL divergence and rewards
to the loss function. However, human preference is not affected by each word in
a sequence equally but is often dependent on specific words or phrases, e.g.
existence of toxic terms leads to non-preferred responses. Based on this
observation, we argue that not all tokens should be weighted equally during PO
and propose a flexible objective termed SparsePO, that aims to automatically
learn to weight the KL divergence and reward corresponding to each token during
PO training. We propose two different variants of weight-masks that can either
be derived from the reference model itself or learned on the fly. Notably, our
method induces sparsity in the learned masks, allowing the model to learn how
to best weight reward and KL divergence contributions at the token level,
learning an optimal level of mask sparsity. Extensive experiments on multiple
domains, including sentiment control, dialogue, text summarization and
text-to-code generation, illustrate that our approach assigns meaningful
weights to tokens according to the target task, generates more responses with
the desired preference and improves reasoning tasks by up to 2 percentage
points compared to other token- and response-level PO methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05102v1,,False
HyperINF: Unleashing the HyperPower of the Schulz's Method for Data Influence Estimation,07/10/2024,"Xinyu Zhou, Simin Fan, Martin Jaggi","Influence functions provide a principled method to assess the contribution of
individual training samples to a specific target. Yet, their high computational
costs limit their applications on large-scale models and datasets. Existing
methods proposed for influence function approximation have significantly
reduced the computational overheads. However, they mostly suffer from
inaccurate estimation due to the lack of strong convergence guarantees from the
algorithm. The family of hyperpower methods are well-known for their rigorous
convergence guarantees on matrix inverse approximation, while the matrix
multiplication operation can involve intractable memory and computation costs
on large-scale models. We propose HyperINF, an efficient and accurate influence
function approximation method which leverages the hyperpower method,
specifically Schulz's iterative algorithm.
  To deal with the computation-intensive matrix multiplication, we incorporate
the generalized fisher information (GFIM) as a low-rank approximation of the
Hessian matrix, which reduces the memory and computation overheads to constant
costs independent of ranks on LoRA-tuned models.
  We first demonstrate the superior accuracy and stability of \method compared
to other baselines through a synthetic convergence simulation for matrix
inversion. We further validate the efficacy of \method through extensive
real-world data attribution tasks, including mislabeled data detection and data
selection for LLM and VLM fine-tuning.
  On LoRA-tuned models, HyperINF achieves superior downstream performance with
minimal memory and computational overhead, while other baselines suffer from
significant degradation. Our codebase is available at

Compression via Pre-trained Transformers: A Study on Byte-Level Multimodal Data,07/10/2024,"David Heurtel-Depeiges, Anian Ruoss, Joel Veness, Tim Genewein","Foundation models have recently been shown to be strong data compressors.
However, when accounting for their excessive parameter count, their compression
ratios are actually inferior to standard compression algorithms. Moreover,
naively reducing the number of parameters may not necessarily help as it leads
to worse predictions and thus weaker compression. In this paper, we conduct a
large-scale empirical study to investigate whether there is a sweet spot where
competitive compression ratios with pre-trained vanilla transformers are
possible. To this end, we train families of models on 165GB of raw byte
sequences of either text, image, or audio data (and all possible combinations
of the three) and then compress 1GB of out-of-distribution (OOD) data from each
modality. We find that relatively small models (i.e., millions of parameters)
can outperform standard general-purpose compression algorithms (gzip, LZMA2)
and even domain-specific compressors (PNG, JPEG 2000, FLAC) - even when
factoring in parameter count. We achieve, e.g., the lowest compression ratio of
0.49 on OOD audio data (vs. 0.54 for FLAC). To study the impact of model- and
dataset scale, we conduct extensive ablations and hyperparameter sweeps, and we
investigate the effect of unimodal versus multimodal training. We find that
even small models can be trained to perform well on multiple modalities, but,
in contrast to previously reported results with large-scale foundation models,
transfer to unseen modalities is generally weak.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05078v1,,False
Assumption-Lean Post-Integrated Inference with Negative Control Outcomes,07/10/2024,"Jin-Hong Du, Kathryn Roeder, Larry Wasserman","Data integration has become increasingly common in aligning multiple
heterogeneous datasets. With high-dimensional outcomes, data integration
methods aim to extract low-dimensional embeddings of observations to remove
unwanted variations, such as batch effects and unmeasured covariates, inherent
in data collected from different sources. However, multiple hypothesis testing
after data integration can be substantially biased due to the data-dependent
integration processes. To address this challenge, we introduce a robust
post-integrated inference (PII) method that adjusts for latent heterogeneity
using negative control outcomes. By leveraging causal interpretations, we
derive nonparametric identification conditions that form the basis of our PII
approach.
  Our assumption-lean semiparametric inference method extends robustness and
generality to projected direct effect estimands that account for mediators,
confounders, and moderators. These estimands remain statistically meaningful
under model misspecifications and with error-prone embeddings. We provide
deterministic quantifications of the bias of target estimands induced by
estimated embeddings and finite-sample linear expansions of the estimators with
uniform concentration bounds on the residuals for all outcomes.
  The proposed doubly robust estimators are consistent and efficient under
minimal assumptions, facilitating data-adaptive estimation with machine
learning algorithms. Using random forests, we evaluate empirical statistical
errors in simulations and analyze single-cell CRISPR perturbed datasets with
potential unmeasured confounders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04996v1,,False
Random-projection ensemble dimension reduction,07/10/2024,"Wenxing Zhou, Timothy I. Cannings","We introduce a new framework for dimension reduction in the context of
high-dimensional regression. Our proposal is to aggregate an ensemble of random
projections, which have been carefully chosen based on the empirical regression
performance after being applied to the covariates. More precisely, we consider
disjoint groups of independent random projections, apply a base regression
method after each projection, and retain the projection in each group based on
the empirical performance. We aggregate the selected projections by taking the
singular value decomposition of their empirical average and then output the
leading order singular vectors. A particularly appealing aspect of our approach
is that the singular values provide a measure of the relative importance of the
corresponding projection directions, which can be used to select the final
projection dimension. We investigate in detail (and provide default
recommendations for) various aspects of our general framework, including the
projection distribution and the base regression method, as well as the number
of random projections used. Additionally, we investigate the possibility of
further reducing the dimension by applying our algorithm twice in cases where
projection dimension recommended in the initial application is too large. Our
theoretical results show that the error of our algorithm stabilises as the
number of groups of projections increases. We demonstrate the excellent
empirical performance of our proposal in a large numerical study using
simulated and real data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04922v1,,False
Unsupervised Skill Discovery for Robotic Manipulation through Automatic Task Generation,07/10/2024,"Paul Jansonnie, Bingbing Wu, Julien Perez, Jan Peters","Learning skills that interact with objects is of major importance for robotic
manipulation. These skills can indeed serve as an efficient prior for solving
various manipulation tasks. We propose a novel Skill Learning approach that
discovers composable behaviors by solving a large and diverse number of
autonomously generated tasks. Our method learns skills allowing the robot to
consistently and robustly interact with objects in its environment. The
discovered behaviors are embedded in primitives which can be composed with
Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning to solve unseen manipulation tasks. In
particular, we leverage Asymmetric Self-Play to discover behaviors and
Multiplicative Compositional Policies to embed them. We compare our method to
Skill Learning baselines and find that our skills are more interactive.
Furthermore, the learned skills can be used to solve a set of unseen
manipulation tasks, in simulation as well as on a real robotic platform.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04855v1,,False
Learning Interpretable Hierarchical Dynamical Systems Models from Time Series Data,07/10/2024,"Manuel Brenner, Elias Weber, Georgia Koppe, Daniel Durstewitz","In science, we are often interested in obtaining a generative model of the
underlying system dynamics from observed time series. While powerful methods
for dynamical systems reconstruction (DSR) exist when data come from a single
domain, how to best integrate data from multiple dynamical regimes and leverage
it for generalization is still an open question. This becomes particularly
important when individual time series are short, and group-level information
may help to fill in for gaps in single-domain data. At the same time, averaging
is not an option in DSR, as it will wipe out crucial dynamical properties
(e.g., limit cycles in one domain vs. chaos in another). Hence, a framework is
needed that enables to efficiently harvest group-level (multi-domain)
information while retaining all single-domain dynamical characteristics. Here
we provide such a hierarchical approach and showcase it on popular DSR
benchmarks, as well as on neuroscientific and medical time series. In addition
to faithful reconstruction of all individual dynamical regimes, our
unsupervised methodology discovers common low-dimensional feature spaces in
which datasets with similar dynamics cluster. The features spanning these
spaces were further dynamically highly interpretable, surprisingly in often
linear relation to control parameters that govern the dynamics of the
underlying system. Finally, we illustrate transfer learning and generalization
to new parameter regimes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04814v1,,False
Timer-XL: Long-Context Transformers for Unified Time Series Forecasting,07/10/2024,"Yong Liu, Guo Qin, Xiangdong Huang, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long","We present Timer-XL, a generative Transformer for unified time series
forecasting. To uniformly predict 1D and 2D time series, we generalize next
token prediction, predominantly adopted for causal generation of 1D sequences,
to multivariate next token prediction. The proposed paradigm uniformly
formulates various forecasting scenarios as a long-context generation problem.
We opt for the generative Transformer, which can capture global-range and
causal dependencies while providing contextual flexibility, to implement
unified forecasting on univariate series characterized by non-stationarity,
multivariate time series with complicated dynamics and correlations, and
covariate-informed contexts that include both endogenous and exogenous
variables. Technically, we propose a universal TimeAttention to facilitate
generative Transformers on time series, which can effectively capture
fine-grained intra- and inter-series dependencies of flattened time series
tokens (patches) and is further strengthened by position embeddings in both
temporal and variable dimensions. Timer-XL achieves state-of-the-art
performance across challenging forecasting benchmarks through a unified
approach. As a large time series model, it demonstrates notable model
transferability by large-scale pre-training, as well as contextual flexibility
in token lengths, positioning it as a one-for-all forecaster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04803v1,,False
ACDC: Autoregressive Coherent Multimodal Generation using Diffusion Correction,07/10/2024,"Hyungjin Chung, Dohun Lee, Jong Chul Ye","Autoregressive models (ARMs) and diffusion models (DMs) represent two leading
paradigms in generative modeling, each excelling in distinct areas: ARMs in
global context modeling and long-sequence generation, and DMs in generating
high-quality local contexts, especially for continuous data such as images and
short videos. However, ARMs often suffer from exponential error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to physically implausible results, while DMs are
limited by their local context generation capabilities. In this work, we
introduce Autoregressive Coherent multimodal generation with Diffusion
Correction (ACDC), a zero-shot approach that combines the strengths of both
ARMs and DMs at the inference stage without the need for additional
fine-tuning. ACDC leverages ARMs for global context generation and
memory-conditioned DMs for local correction, ensuring high-quality outputs by
correcting artifacts in generated multimodal tokens. In particular, we propose
a memory module based on large language models (LLMs) that dynamically adjusts
the conditioning texts for the DMs, preserving crucial global context
information. Our experiments on multimodal tasks, including coherent
multi-frame story generation and autoregressive video generation, demonstrate
that ACDC effectively mitigates the accumulation of errors and significantly
enhances the quality of generated outputs, achieving superior performance while
remaining agnostic to specific ARM and DM architectures. Project page:

Rule-based Data Selection for Large Language Models,07/10/2024,"Xiaomin Li, Mingye Gao, Zhiwei Zhang, Chang Yue, Hong Hu","The quality of training data significantly impacts the performance of large
language models (LLMs). There are increasing studies using LLMs to rate and
select data based on several human-crafted metrics (rules). However, these
conventional rule-based approaches often depend too heavily on human
heuristics, lack effective metrics for assessing rules, and exhibit limited
adaptability to new tasks. In our study, we introduce an innovative rule-based
framework that utilizes the orthogonality of score vectors associated with
rules as a novel metric for rule evaluations. Our approach includes an
automated pipeline that first uses LLMs to generate a diverse set of rules,
encompassing various rating dimensions to evaluate data quality. Then it rates
a batch of data based on these rules and uses the determinantal point process
(DPP) from random matrix theory to select the most orthogonal score vectors,
thereby identifying a set of independent rules. These rules are subsequently
used to evaluate all data, selecting samples with the highest average scores
for downstream tasks such as LLM training. We verify the effectiveness of our
method through two experimental setups: 1) comparisons with ground truth
ratings and 2) benchmarking LLMs trained with the chosen data. Our
comprehensive experiments cover a range of scenarios, including general
pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning in areas such as IMDB, Medical,
Math, and Code. The outcomes demonstrate that our DPP-based rule rating method
consistently outperforms other approaches, including rule-free rating, uniform
sampling, importance resampling, and QuRating, in terms of both rating
precision and model performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04715v1,,False
SegINR: Segment-wise Implicit Neural Representation for Sequence Alignment in Neural Text-to-Speech,07/10/2024,"Minchan Kim, Myeonghun Jeong, Joun Yeop Lee, Nam Soo Kim","We present SegINR, a novel approach to neural Text-to-Speech (TTS) that
addresses sequence alignment without relying on an auxiliary duration predictor

sequence modeling. SegINR simplifies the process by converting text sequences
directly into frame-level features. It leverages an optimal text encoder to
extract embeddings, transforming each into a segment of frame-level features
using a conditional implicit neural representation (INR). This method, named
segment-wise INR (SegINR), models temporal dynamics within each segment and
autonomously defines segment boundaries, reducing computational costs. We
integrate SegINR into a two-stage TTS framework, using it for semantic token
prediction. Our experiments in zero-shot adaptive TTS scenarios demonstrate
that SegINR outperforms conventional methods in speech quality with
computational efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04690v1,,False
Regressing the Relative Future: Efficient Policy Optimization for Multi-turn RLHF,06/10/2024,"Zhaolin Gao, Wenhao Zhan, Jonathan D. Chang, Gokul Swamy, Kianté Brantley, Jason D. Lee, Wen Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success at tasks like
summarization that involve a single turn of interaction. However, they can
still struggle with multi-turn tasks like dialogue that require long-term
planning. Previous works on multi-turn dialogue extend single-turn
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods to the multi-turn
setting by treating all prior dialogue turns as a long context. Such approaches
suffer from covariate shift: the conversations in the training set have
previous turns generated by some reference policy, which means that low
training error may not necessarily correspond to good performance when the
learner is actually in the conversation loop. In response, we introduce
REgressing the RELative FUture (REFUEL), an efficient policy optimization
approach designed to address multi-turn RLHF in LLMs. REFUEL employs a single
model to estimate $Q$-values and trains on self-generated data, addressing the
covariate shift issue. REFUEL frames the multi-turn RLHF problem as a sequence
of regression tasks on iteratively collected datasets, enabling ease of
implementation. Theoretically, we prove that REFUEL can match the performance
of any policy covered by the training set. Empirically, we evaluate our
algorithm by using Llama-3.1-70B-it to simulate a user in conversation with our
model. REFUEL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods such as DPO and
REBEL across various settings. Furthermore, despite having only 8 billion
parameters, Llama-3-8B-it fine-tuned with REFUEL outperforms Llama-3.1-70B-it
on long multi-turn dialogues. Implementation of REFUEL can be found at

Modeling Social Media Recommendation Impacts Using Academic Networks: A Graph Neural Network Approach,06/10/2024,"Sabrina Guidotti, Gregor Donabauer, Simone Somazzi, Udo Kruschwitz, Davide Taibi, Dimitri Ognibene","The widespread use of social media has highlighted potential negative impacts
on society and individuals, largely driven by recommendation algorithms that

Pullback Flow Matching on Data Manifolds,06/10/2024,"Friso de Kruiff, Erik Bekkers, Ozan Öktem, Carola-Bibiane Schönlieb, Willem Diepeveen","We propose Pullback Flow Matching (PFM), a novel framework for generative

closed-form mappings on the data manifold but also allows for designable latent
spaces, using assumed metrics on both data and latent manifolds. By enhancing
isometric learning through Neural ODEs and proposing a scalable training
objective, we achieve a latent space more suitable for interpolation, leading
to improved manifold learning and generative performance. We demonstrate PFM's
effectiveness through applications in synthetic data, protein dynamics and

Improved Off-policy Reinforcement Learning in Biological Sequence Design,06/10/2024,"Hyeonah Kim, Minsu Kim, Taeyoung Yun, Sanghyeok Choi, Emmanuel Bengio, Alex Hernández-García, Jinkyoo Park","Designing biological sequences with desired properties is a significant
challenge due to the combinatorially vast search space and the high cost of
evaluating each candidate sequence. To address these challenges, reinforcement
learning (RL) methods, such as GFlowNets, utilize proxy models for rapid reward
evaluation and annotated data for policy training. Although these approaches
have shown promise in generating diverse and novel sequences, the limited
training data relative to the vast search space often leads to the
misspecification of proxy for out-of-distribution inputs. We introduce
$\delta$-Conservative Search, a novel off-policy search method for training
GFlowNets designed to improve robustness against proxy misspecification. The
key idea is to incorporate conservativeness, controlled by parameter $\delta$,
to constrain the search to reliable regions. Specifically, we inject noise into
high-score offline sequences by randomly masking tokens with a Bernoulli
distribution of parameter $\delta$ and then denoise masked tokens using the
GFlowNet policy. Additionally, $\delta$ is adaptively adjusted based on the
uncertainty of the proxy model for each data point. This enables the reflection
of proxy uncertainty to determine the level of conservativeness. Experimental
results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing machine

TimeBridge: Non-Stationarity Matters for Long-term Time Series Forecasting,06/10/2024,"Peiyuan Liu, Beiliang Wu, Yifan Hu, Naiqi Li, Tao Dai, Jigang Bao, Shu-tao Xia","Non-stationarity poses significant challenges for multivariate time series
forecasting due to the inherent short-term fluctuations and long-term trends
that can lead to spurious regressions or obscure essential long-term

non-stationarity without adequately addressing its distinct impacts on
short-term and long-term modeling. Eliminating non-stationarity is essential
for avoiding spurious regressions and capturing local dependencies in
short-term modeling, while preserving it is crucial for revealing long-term
cointegration across variates. In this paper, we propose TimeBridge, a novel
framework designed to bridge the gap between non-stationarity and dependency
modeling in long-term time series forecasting. By segmenting input series into
smaller patches, TimeBridge applies Integrated Attention to mitigate short-term
non-stationarity and capture stable dependencies within each variate, while
Cointegrated Attention preserves non-stationarity to model long-term

Correlation-Aware Select and Merge Attention for Efficient Fine-Tuning and Context Length Extension,05/10/2024,"Ning Wang, Zekun Li, Tongxin Bai, Guoqi Li","Modeling long sequences is crucial for various large-scale models; however,
extending existing architectures to handle longer sequences presents
significant technical and resource challenges. In this paper, we propose an
efficient and flexible attention architecture that enables the extension of
context lengths in large language models with reduced computational resources
and fine-tuning time compared to other excellent methods. Specifically, we
introduce correlation-aware selection and merging mechanisms to facilitate
efficient sparse attention. In addition, we also propose a novel data
augmentation technique involving positional encodings to enhance generalization
to unseen positions. The results are as follows: First, using a single A100, we
achieve fine-tuning on Llama2-7B with a sequence length of 32K, which is more
efficient than other methods that rely on subsets for regression. Second, we
present a comprehensive method for extending context lengths across the
pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference phases. During pre-training, our
attention mechanism partially breaks translation invariance during token
selection, so we apply positional encodings only to the selected tokens. This
approach achieves relatively high performance and significant extrapolation
capabilities. For fine-tuning, we introduce Cyclic, Randomly Truncated, and
Dynamically Growing NTK Positional Embedding (CRD NTK). This design allows
fine-tuning with a sequence length of only 16K, enabling models such as
Llama2-7B and Mistral-7B to perform inference with context lengths of up to 1M
or even arbitrary lengths. Our method achieves 100\% accuracy on the passkey
task with a context length of 4M and maintains stable perplexity at a 1M
context length. This represents at least a 64-fold reduction in resource
requirements compared to traditional full-attention mechanisms, while still
achieving competitive performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04211v1,,False
Unsupervised Assessment of Landscape Shifts Based on Persistent Entropy and Topological Preservation,05/10/2024,Sebastian Basterrech,"Concept drift typically refers to the analysis of changes in data
distribution. A drift in the input data can have negative consequences on a
learning predictor and the system's stability. The majority of concept drift
methods emphasize the analysis of statistical changes in non-stationary data
over time. In this context, we consider another perspective, where the concept
drift also integrates substantial changes in the topological characteristics of
the data stream. In this article, we introduce a novel framework for monitoring
changes in multi-dimensional data streams. We explore a generalization of the
standard concept drift focusing on the changes in the topological
characteristics of the data. Our developed approach is based on persistent
entropy and topology-preserving projections in a continual learning scenario.
The framework operates in both unsupervised and supervised environments. To
demonstrate the utility of the proposed framework, we analyze the model across
three scenarios using data streams generated with MNIST samples. The obtained
results reveal the potential of applying topological data analysis for shift
detection and encourage further research in this area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04183v1,,False
Applying Quantum Autoencoders for Time Series Anomaly Detection,05/10/2024,"Robin Frehner, Kurt Stockinger","Anomaly detection is an important problem with applications in various
domains such as fraud detection, pattern recognition or medical diagnosis.
Several algorithms have been introduced using classical computing approaches.
However, using quantum computing for solving anomaly detection problems in time
series data is a widely unexplored research field.
  This paper explores the application of quantum autoencoders to time series
anomaly detection. We investigate two primary techniques for classifying
anomalies: (1) Analyzing the reconstruction error generated by the quantum
autoencoder and (2) latent representation analysis. Our simulated experimental
results, conducted across various ansaetze, demonstrate that quantum
autoencoders consistently outperform classical deep learning-based autoencoders
across multiple datasets. Specifically, quantum autoencoders achieve superior
anomaly detection performance while utilizing 60-230 times fewer parameters and
requiring five times fewer training iterations. In addition, we implement our
quantum encoder on real quantum hardware. Our experimental results demonstrate
that quantum autoencoders achieve anomaly detection performance on par with
their simulated counterparts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04154v1,,False
ECon: On the Detection and Resolution of Evidence Conflicts,05/10/2024,"Cheng Jiayang, Chunkit Chan, Qianqian Zhuang, Lin Qiu, Tianhang Zhang, Tengxiao Liu, Yangqiu Song, Yue Zhang, Pengfei Liu, Zheng Zhang","The rise of large language models (LLMs) has significantly influenced the
quality of information in decision-making systems, leading to the prevalence of
AI-generated content and challenges in detecting misinformation and managing
conflicting information, or ""inter-evidence conflicts."" This study introduces a
method for generating diverse, validated evidence conflicts to simulate
real-world misinformation scenarios. We evaluate conflict detection methods,
including Natural Language Inference (NLI) models, factual consistency (FC)
models, and LLMs, on these conflicts (RQ1) and analyze LLMs' conflict
resolution behaviors (RQ2). Our key findings include: (1) NLI and LLM models
exhibit high precision in detecting answer conflicts, though weaker models
suffer from low recall; (2) FC models struggle with lexically similar answer
conflicts, while NLI and LLM models handle these better; and (3) stronger
models like GPT-4 show robust performance, especially with nuanced conflicts.
For conflict resolution, LLMs often favor one piece of conflicting evidence
without justification and rely on internal knowledge if they have prior
beliefs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04068v1,,False
Is Score Matching Suitable for Estimating Point Processes?,05/10/2024,"Haoqun Cao, Zizhuo Meng, Tianjun Ke, Feng Zhou","Score matching estimators have gained widespread attention in recent years
partly because they are free from calculating the integral of normalizing
constant, thereby addressing the computational challenges in maximum likelihood
estimation (MLE). Some existing works have proposed score matching estimators
for point processes. However, this work demonstrates that the incompleteness of
the estimators proposed in those works renders them applicable only to specific
problems, and they fail for more general point processes. To address this
issue, this work introduces the weighted score matching estimator to point
processes. Theoretically, we prove the consistency of our estimator and
establish its rate of convergence. Experimental results indicate that our
estimator accurately estimates model parameters on synthetic data and yields
results consistent with MLE on real data. In contrast, existing score matching
estimators fail to perform effectively. Codes are publicly available at
