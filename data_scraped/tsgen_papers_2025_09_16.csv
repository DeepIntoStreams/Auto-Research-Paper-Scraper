RAGs to Riches: RAG-like Few-shot Learning for Large Language Model Role-playing,15/09/2025,"Timothy Rupprecht, Enfu Nan, Arash Akbari, Arman Akbari, Lei Lu, Priyanka Maan, Sean Duffy, Pu Zhao, Yumei He, David Kaeli, Yanzhi Wang","Role-playing Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in
high-stakes domains such as healthcare, education, and governance, where
failures can directly impact user trust and well-being. A cost effective
paradigm for LLM role-playing is few-shot learning, but existing approaches
often cause models to break character in unexpected and potentially harmful
ways, especially when interacting with hostile users. Inspired by
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), we reformulate LLM role-playing into a
text retrieval problem and propose a new prompting framework called
RAGs-to-Riches, which leverages curated reference demonstrations to condition
LLM responses. We evaluate our framework with LLM-as-a-judge preference voting
and introduce two novel token-level ROUGE metrics: Intersection over Output
(IOO) to quantity how much an LLM improvises and Intersection over References
(IOR) to measure few-shot demonstrations utilization rate during the evaluation
tasks. When simulating interactions with a hostile user, our prompting strategy
incorporates in its responses during inference an average of 35% more tokens
from the reference demonstrations. As a result, across 453 role-playing
interactions, our models are consistently judged as being more authentic, and
remain in-character more often than zero-shot and in-context Learning (ICL)
methods. Our method presents a scalable strategy for building robust,
human-aligned LLM role-playing frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12168v1,,False
In-domain SSL pre-training and streaming ASR,15/09/2025,"Jarod Duret, Salima Mdhaffar, Gaëlle Laperrière, Ryan Whetten, Audrey Galametz, Catherine Kobus, Marion-Cécile Martin, Jo Oleiwan, Yannick Estève","In this study, we investigate the benefits of domain-specific self-supervised
pre-training for both offline and streaming ASR in Air Traffic Control (ATC)
environments. We train BEST-RQ models on 4.5k hours of unlabeled ATC data, then
fine-tune on a smaller supervised ATC set. To enable real-time processing, we
propose using chunked attention and dynamic convolutions, ensuring low-latency
inference. We compare these in-domain SSL models against state-of-the-art,
general-purpose speech encoders such as w2v-BERT 2.0 and HuBERT. Results show
that domain-adapted pre-training substantially improves performance on standard
ATC benchmarks, significantly reducing word error rates when compared to models
trained on broad speech corpora. Furthermore, the proposed streaming approach
further improves word error rate under tighter latency constraints, making it
particularly suitable for safety-critical aviation applications. These findings
highlight that specializing SSL representations for ATC data is a practical
path toward more accurate and efficient ASR systems in real-world operational
settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12101v1,,False
Deceptive Risk Minimization: Out-of-Distribution Generalization by Deceiving Distribution Shift Detectors,15/09/2025,Anirudha Majumdar,"This paper proposes deception as a mechanism for out-of-distribution (OOD)
generalization: by learning data representations that make training data appear
independent and identically distributed (iid) to an observer, we can identify
stable features that eliminate spurious correlations and generalize to unseen
domains. We refer to this principle as deceptive risk minimization (DRM) and
instantiate it with a practical differentiable objective that simultaneously
learns features that eliminate distribution shifts from the perspective of a
detector based on conformal martingales while minimizing a task-specific loss.
In contrast to domain adaptation or prior invariant representation learning
methods, DRM does not require access to test data or a partitioning of training
data into a finite number of data-generating domains. We demonstrate the
efficacy of DRM on numerical experiments with concept shift and a simulated
imitation learning setting with covariate shift in environments that a robot is
deployed in.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12081v1,,False
A Time-Series Foundation Model by Universal Delay Embedding,15/09/2025,"Zijian Wang, Peng Tao, Jifan Shi, Rui Bao, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen","This study introduces Universal Delay Embedding (UDE), a pretrained
foundation model designed to revolutionize time-series forecasting through
principled integration of delay embedding representation and Koopman operator
prediction. Leveraging Takens' embedding theorem, UDE as a dynamical
representation of observed data constructs two-dimensional subspace patches
from Hankel matrices, theoretically preserving dynamical and topological
properties of underlying dynamical systems. Such patches are viewed as images,
which can be efficiently processed by exploiting advanced deep learning
technologies. Computationally, these patches further serve as tokens for
learning a self-attention encoder, thus enabling accurate prediction of
nonlinear time-series by a finite-dimensional Koopman operator in a linear
manner in a latent space. Extensive evaluations across various benchmarks and
real-world climate datasets demonstrate over 20% average reduction in mean
squared error versus state-of-the-art foundation models, alongside superior
generalization in fine-tuning scenarios. In particular, the learned dynamical
representations and Koopman operator prediction forms from the patches exhibit
exceptional interpretability, with consistent identification of topologically
informative subspaces and robust encoding of domain-invariant dynamics,
establishing UDE as a scalable, interpretable framework for universal
time-series modeling and forecasting with broad scientific and industrial
applicability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12080v1,,False
Travel Time and Weather-Aware Traffic Forecasting in a Conformal Graph Neural Network Framework,15/09/2025,"Mayur Patil, Qadeer Ahmed, Shawn Midlam-Mohler","Traffic flow forecasting is essential for managing congestion, improving
safety, and optimizing various transportation systems. However, it remains a
prevailing challenge due to the stochastic nature of urban traffic and
environmental factors. Better predictions require models capable of
accommodating the traffic variability influenced by multiple dynamic and
complex interdependent factors. In this work, we propose a Graph Neural Network
(GNN) framework to address the stochasticity by leveraging adaptive adjacency
matrices using log-normal distributions and Coefficient of Variation (CV)
values to reflect real-world travel time variability. Additionally, weather
factors such as temperature, wind speed, and precipitation adjust edge weights
and enable GNN to capture evolving spatio-temporal dependencies across traffic
stations. This enhancement over the static adjacency matrix allows the model to
adapt effectively to traffic stochasticity and changing environmental
conditions. Furthermore, we utilize the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP)
framework to provide reliable uncertainty quantification, achieving target
coverage while maintaining acceptable prediction intervals. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed model, in comparison with baseline
methods, showed better prediction accuracy and uncertainty bounds. We, then,
validate this method by constructing traffic scenarios in SUMO and applying
Monte-Carlo simulation to derive a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under
Test (VUT) to reflect real-world variability. The simulated mean travel time of
the VUT falls within the intervals defined by INRIX historical data, verifying
the model's robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12043v1,,False
Imitation Learning as Return Distribution Matching,15/09/2025,"Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli","We study the problem of training a risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL)
agent through imitation learning (IL). Unlike standard IL, our goal is not only
to train an agent that matches the expert's expected return (i.e., its average
performance) but also its risk attitude (i.e., other features of the return
distribution, such as variance). We propose a general formulation of the
risk-sensitive IL problem in which the objective is to match the expert's
return distribution in Wasserstein distance. We focus on the tabular setting
and assume the expert's reward is known. After demonstrating the limited
expressivity of Markovian policies for this task, we introduce an efficient and
sufficiently expressive subclass of non-Markovian policies tailored to it.
Building on this subclass, we develop two provably efficient algorithms, RS-BC
and RS-KT, for solving the problem when the transition model is unknown and
known, respectively. We show that RS-KT achieves substantially lower sample
complexity than RS-BC by exploiting dynamics information. We further
demonstrate the sample efficiency of return distribution matching in the
setting where the expert's reward is unknown by designing an oracle-based
variant of RS-KT. Finally, we complement our theoretical analysis of RS-KT and
RS-BC with numerical simulations, highlighting both their sample efficiency and
the advantages of non-Markovian policies over standard sample-efficient IL
algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12026v1,,False
Generalizing Behavior via Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Closed-Form Reward Centroids,15/09/2025,"Filippo Lazzati, Alberto Maria Metelli","We study the problem of generalizing an expert agent's behavior, provided
through demonstrations, to new environments and/or additional constraints.
Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) offers a promising solution by seeking to
recover the expert's underlying reward function, which, if used for planning in
the new settings, would reproduce the desired behavior. However, IRL is
inherently ill-posed: multiple reward functions, forming the so-called feasible
set, can explain the same observed behavior. Since these rewards may induce
different policies in the new setting, in the absence of additional
information, a decision criterion is needed to select which policy to deploy.
In this paper, we propose a novel, principled criterion that selects the
""average"" policy among those induced by the rewards in a certain bounded subset
of the feasible set. Remarkably, we show that this policy can be obtained by
planning with the reward centroid of that subset, for which we derive a
closed-form expression. We then present a provably efficient algorithm for
estimating this centroid using an offline dataset of expert demonstrations
only. Finally, we conduct numerical simulations that illustrate the
relationship between the expert's behavior and the behavior produced by our
method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12010v1,,False
Identifiable Autoregressive Variational Autoencoders for Nonlinear and Nonstationary Spatio-Temporal Blind Source Separation,15/09/2025,"Mika Sipilä, Klaus Nordhausen, Sara Taskinen","The modeling and prediction of multivariate spatio-temporal data involve
numerous challenges. Dimension reduction methods can significantly simplify
this process, provided that they account for the complex dependencies between
variables and across time and space. Nonlinear blind source separation has
emerged as a promising approach, particularly following recent advances in
identifiability results. Building on these developments, we introduce the
identifiable autoregressive variational autoencoder, which ensures the
identifiability of latent components consisting of nonstationary autoregressive
processes. The blind source separation efficacy of the proposed method is
showcased through a simulation study, where it is compared against
state-of-the-art methods, and the spatio-temporal prediction performance is
evaluated against several competitors on air pollution and weather datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11962v1,,False
Neuro-Symbolic Agents with Modal Logic for Autonomous Diagnostics,15/09/2025,"Antonin Sulc, Thorsten Hellert","The development of intelligent agents, particularly those powered by language
models (LMs), has shown the critical role in various environments that require
intelligent and autonomous decision. Environments are not passive testing
grounds and they represent the data required for agents to learn and exhibit
very challenging conditions that require adaptive, complex and autonomous
capacity to make decisions. While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets
has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the
structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these
environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research. This
paper introduces a neuro-symbolic multi-agent architecture where the belief
states of individual agents are formally represented as Kripke models. This
foundational choice enables them to reason about known concepts of
\emph{possibility} and \emph{necessity} using the formal language of modal
logic. In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make
infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for
proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively
guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from
reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions. In a high-fidelity
simulated particle accelerator environment, our system successfully diagnoses
complex, cascading failures by combining the powerful semantic intuition of LMs
with the rigorous, verifiable validation of modal logic and a factual world
model and showcasing a viable path toward more robust, reliable, and verifiable
autonomous agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11943v1,,False
EgoMem: Lifelong Memory Agent for Full-duplex Omnimodal Models,15/09/2025,"Yiqun Yao, Naitong Yu, Xiang Li, Xin Jiang, Xuezhi Fang, Wenjia Ma, Xuying Meng, Jing Li, Aixin Sun, Yequan Wang","We introduce EgoMem, the first lifelong memory agent tailored for full-duplex
models that process real-time omnimodal streams. EgoMem enables real-time
models to recognize multiple users directly from raw audiovisual streams, to
provide personalized response, and to maintain long-term knowledge of users'
facts, preferences, and social relationships extracted from audiovisual
history. EgoMem operates with three asynchronous processes: (i) a retrieval
process that dynamically identifies user via face and voice, and gathers
relevant context from a long-term memory; (ii) an omnimodal dialog process that
generates personalized audio responses based on the retrieved context; and
(iii) a memory management process that automatically detects dialog boundaries
from omnimodal streams, and extracts necessary information to update the
long-term memory. Unlike existing memory agents for LLMs, EgoMem relies
entirely on raw audiovisual streams, making it especially suitable for
lifelong, real-time, and embodied scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate
that EgoMem's retrieval and memory management modules achieve over 95% accuracy
on the test set. When integrated with a fine-tuned RoboEgo omnimodal chatbot,
the system achieves fact-consistency scores above 87% in real-time personalized
dialogs, establishing a strong baseline for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11914v1,,False
Growing Perspectives: Modelling Embodied Perspective Taking and Inner Narrative Development Using Large Language Models,15/09/2025,"Sabrina Patania, Luca Annese, Anna Lambiase, Anita Pellegrini, Tom Foulsham, Azzurra Ruggeri, Silvia Rossi, Silvia Serino, Dimitri Ognibene","Language and embodied perspective taking are essential for human
collaboration, yet few computational models address both simultaneously. This
work investigates the PerspAct system [1], which integrates the ReAct (Reason
and Act) paradigm with Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate developmental
stages of perspective taking, grounded in Selman's theory [2]. Using an
extended director task, we evaluate GPT's ability to generate internal
narratives aligned with specified developmental stages, and assess how these
influence collaborative performance both qualitatively (action selection) and
quantitatively (task efficiency). Results show that GPT reliably produces
developmentally-consistent narratives before task execution but often shifts
towards more advanced stages during interaction, suggesting that language
exchanges help refine internal representations. Higher developmental stages
generally enhance collaborative effectiveness, while earlier stages yield more
variable outcomes in complex contexts. These findings highlight the potential
of integrating embodied perspective taking and language in LLMs to better model
developmental dynamics and stress the importance of evaluating internal speech
during combined linguistic and embodied tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11868v1,,False
Synthetic vs. Real Training Data for Visual Navigation,15/09/2025,"Lauri Suomela, Sasanka Kuruppu Arachchige, German F. Torres, Harry Edelman, Joni-Kristian Kämäräinen","This paper investigates how the performance of visual navigation policies
trained in simulation compares to policies trained with real-world data.
Performance degradation of simulator-trained policies is often significant when
they are evaluated in the real world. However, despite this well-known
sim-to-real gap, we demonstrate that simulator-trained policies can match the
performance of their real-world-trained counterparts.
  Central to our approach is a navigation policy architecture that bridges the
sim-to-real appearance gap by leveraging pretrained visual representations and
runs real-time on robot hardware. Evaluations on a wheeled mobile robot show
that the proposed policy, when trained in simulation, outperforms its
real-world-trained version by 31% and the prior state-of-the-art methods by 50%
in navigation success rate. Policy generalization is verified by deploying the
same model onboard a drone.
  Our results highlight the importance of diverse image encoder pretraining for
sim-to-real generalization, and identify on-policy learning as a key advantage
of simulated training over training with real data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11791v1,,False
Task-Agnostic Learnable Weighted-Knowledge Base Scheme for Robust Semantic Communications,15/09/2025,"Shiyao Jiang, Jian Jiao, Xingjian Zhang, Ye Wang, Dusit Niyato, Qinyu Zhang","With the emergence of diverse and massive data in the upcoming
sixth-generation (6G) networks, the task-agnostic semantic communication system
is regarded to provide robust intelligent services. In this paper, we propose a
task-agnostic learnable weighted-knowledge base semantic communication (TALSC)
framework for robust image transmission to address the real-world heterogeneous
data bias in KB, including label flipping noise and class imbalance. The TALSC
framework incorporates a sample confidence module (SCM) as meta-learner and the
semantic coding networks as learners. The learners are updated based on the
empirical knowledge provided by the learnable weighted-KB (LW-KB). Meanwhile,
the meta-learner evaluates the significance of samples according to the task
loss feedback, and adjusts the update strategy of learners to enhance the
robustness in semantic recovery for unknown tasks. To strike a balance between
SCM parameters and precision of significance evaluation, we design an SCM-grid
extension (SCM-GE) approach by embedding the Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KAN)
within SCM, which leverages the concept of spline refinement in KAN and enables
scalable SCM with customizable granularity without retraining. Simulations
demonstrate that the TALSC framework effectively mitigates the effects of
flipping noise and class imbalance in task-agnostic image semantic
communication, achieving at least 12% higher semantic recovery accuracy (SRA)
and multi-scale structural similarity (MS-SSIM) compared to state-of-the-art
methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11636v1,,False
A Survey of Reasoning and Agentic Systems in Time Series with Large Language Models,15/09/2025,"Ching Chang, Yidan Shi, Defu Cao, Wei Yang, Jeehyun Hwang, Haixin Wang, Jiacheng Pang, Wei Wang, Yan Liu, Wen-Chih Peng, Tien-Fu Chen","Time series reasoning treats time as a first-class axis and incorporates
intermediate evidence directly into the answer. This survey defines the problem
and organizes the literature by reasoning topology with three families: direct
reasoning in one step, linear chain reasoning with explicit intermediates, and
branch-structured reasoning that explores, revises, and aggregates. The
topology is crossed with the main objectives of the field, including
traditional time series analysis, explanation and understanding, causal
inference and decision making, and time series generation, while a compact tag
set spans these axes and captures decomposition and verification, ensembling,
tool use, knowledge access, multimodality, agent loops, and LLM alignment
regimes. Methods and systems are reviewed across domains, showing what each
topology enables and where it breaks down in faithfulness or robustness, along
with curated datasets, benchmarks, and resources that support study and
deployment (https://github.com/blacksnail789521/Time-Series-Reasoning-Survey).
Evaluation practices that keep evidence visible and temporally aligned are
highlighted, and guidance is distilled on matching topology to uncertainty,
grounding with observable artifacts, planning for shift and streaming, and
treating cost and latency as design budgets. We emphasize that reasoning
structures must balance capacity for grounding and self-correction against
computational cost and reproducibility, while future progress will likely
depend on benchmarks that tie reasoning quality to utility and on closed-loop
testbeds that trade off cost and risk under shift-aware, streaming, and
long-horizon settings. Taken together, these directions mark a shift from
narrow accuracy toward reliability at scale, enabling systems that not only
analyze but also understand, explain, and act on dynamic worlds with traceable
evidence and credible outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.11575v1,,False
