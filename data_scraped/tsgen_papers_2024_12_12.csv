GPD-1: Generative Pre-training for Driving,11/12/2024,"Zixun Xie, Sicheng Zuo, Wenzhao Zheng, Yunpeng Zhang, Dalong Du, Jie Zhou, Jiwen Lu, Shanghang Zhang","Modeling the evolutions of driving scenarios is important for the evaluation
and decision-making of autonomous driving systems. Most existing methods focus
on one aspect of scene evolution such as map generation, motion prediction, and
trajectory planning. In this paper, we propose a unified Generative
Pre-training for Driving (GPD-1) model to accomplish all these tasks altogether
without additional fine-tuning. We represent each scene with ego, agent, and
map tokens and formulate autonomous driving as a unified token generation
problem. We adopt the autoregressive transformer architecture and use a
scene-level attention mask to enable intra-scene bi-directional interactions.
For the ego and agent tokens, we propose a hierarchical positional tokenizer to
effectively encode both 2D positions and headings. For the map tokens, we train
a map vector-quantized autoencoder to efficiently compress ego-centric semantic
maps into discrete tokens. We pre-train our GPD-1 on the large-scale nuPlan
dataset and conduct extensive experiments to evaluate its effectiveness. With
different prompts, our GPD-1 successfully generalizes to various tasks without
finetuning, including scene generation, traffic simulation, closed-loop
simulation, map prediction, and motion planning. Code:

"Generative Semantic Communication: Architectures, Technologies, and Applications",11/12/2024,"Jinke Ren, Yaping Sun, Hongyang Du, Weiwen Yuan, Chongjie Wang, Xianda Wang, Yingbin Zhou, Ziwei Zhu, Fangxin Wang, Shuguang Cui","This paper delves into the applications of generative artificial intelligence
(GAI) in semantic communication (SemCom) and presents a thorough study. Three
popular SemCom systems enabled by classical GAI models are first introduced,
including variational autoencoders, generative adversarial networks, and
diffusion models. For each system, the fundamental concept of the GAI model,
the corresponding SemCom architecture, and the associated literature review of
recent efforts are elucidated. Then, a novel generative SemCom system is
proposed by incorporating the cutting-edge GAI technology-large language models
(LLMs). This system features two LLM-based AI agents at both the transmitter
and receiver, serving as ""brains"" to enable powerful information understanding
and content regeneration capabilities, respectively. This innovative design
allows the receiver to directly generate the desired content, instead of
recovering the bit stream, based on the coded semantic information conveyed by
the transmitter. Therefore, it shifts the communication mindset from
""information recovery"" to ""information regeneration"" and thus ushers in a new
era of generative SemCom. A case study on point-to-point video retrieval is
presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed generative SemCom
system, showcasing a 99.98% reduction in communication overhead and a 53%
improvement in retrieval accuracy compared to the traditional communication
system. Furthermore, four typical application scenarios for generative SemCom
are delineated, followed by a discussion of three open issues warranting future
investigation. In a nutshell, this paper provides a holistic set of guidelines
for applying GAI in SemCom, paving the way for the efficient implementation of
generative SemCom in future wireless networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08642v1,,False
Synthetic Vision: Training Vision-Language Models to Understand Physics,11/12/2024,"Vahid Balazadeh, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Hyunmin Cheong, Amir Hosein Khasahmadi, Rahul G. Krishnan","Physical reasoning, which involves the interpretation, understanding, and
prediction of object behavior in dynamic environments, remains a significant
challenge for current Vision-Language Models (VLMs). In this work, we propose
two methods to enhance VLMs' physical reasoning capabilities using simulated
data. First, we fine-tune a pre-trained VLM using question-answer (QA) pairs
generated from simulations relevant to physical reasoning tasks. Second, we
introduce Physics Context Builders (PCBs), specialized VLMs fine-tuned to
create scene descriptions enriched with physical properties and processes.
During physical reasoning tasks, these PCBs can be leveraged as context to
assist a Large Language Model (LLM) to improve its performance. We evaluate
both of our approaches using multiple benchmarks, including a new stability
detection QA dataset called Falling Tower, which includes both simulated and
real-world scenes, and CLEVRER. We demonstrate that a small QA fine-tuned VLM
can significantly outperform larger state-of-the-art foundational models. We
also show that integrating PCBs boosts the performance of foundational LLMs on
physical reasoning tasks. Using the real-world scenes from the Falling Tower
dataset, we also validate the robustness of both approaches in Sim2Real
transfer. Our results highlight the utility that simulated data can have in the
creation of learning systems capable of advanced physical reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08619v1,,False
RoomTour3D: Geometry-Aware Video-Instruction Tuning for Embodied Navigation,11/12/2024,"Mingfei Han, Liang Ma, Kamila Zhumakhanova, Ekaterina Radionova, Jingyi Zhang, Xiaojun Chang, Xiaodan Liang, Ivan Laptev","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) suffers from the limited diversity and
scale of training data, primarily constrained by the manual curation of
existing simulators. To address this, we introduce RoomTour3D, a
video-instruction dataset derived from web-based room tour videos that capture
real-world indoor spaces and human walking demonstrations. Unlike existing VLN
datasets, RoomTour3D leverages the scale and diversity of online videos to
generate open-ended human walking trajectories and open-world navigable
instructions. To compensate for the lack of navigation data in online videos,
we perform 3D reconstruction and obtain 3D trajectories of walking paths
augmented with additional information on the room types, object locations and
3D shape of surrounding scenes. Our dataset includes $\sim$100K open-ended
description-enriched trajectories with $\sim$200K instructions, and 17K
action-enriched trajectories from 1847 room tour environments. We demonstrate
experimentally that RoomTour3D enables significant improvements across multiple
VLN tasks including CVDN, SOON, R2R, and REVERIE. Moreover, RoomTour3D
facilitates the development of trainable zero-shot VLN agents, showcasing the
potential and challenges of advancing towards open-world navigation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08591v1,,False
Learning Sketch Decompositions in Planning via Deep Reinforcement Learning,11/12/2024,"Michael Aichm√ºller, Hector Geffner","In planning and reinforcement learning, the identification of common subgoal
structures across problems is important when goals are to be achieved over long
horizons. Recently, it has been shown that such structures can be expressed as
feature-based rules, called sketches, over a number of classical planning
domains. These sketches split problems into subproblems which then become
solvable in low polynomial time by a greedy sequence of IW$(k)$ searches.
Methods for learning sketches using feature pools and min-SAT solvers have been
developed, yet they face two key limitations: scalability and expressivity. In
this work, we address these limitations by formulating the problem of learning
sketch decompositions as a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) task, where
general policies are sought in a modified planning problem where the successor
states of a state s are defined as those reachable from s through an IW$(k)$
search. The sketch decompositions obtained through this method are
experimentally evaluated across various domains, and problems are regarded as
solved by the decomposition when the goal is reached through a greedy sequence
of IW$(k)$ searches. While our DRL approach for learning sketch decompositions
does not yield interpretable sketches in the form of rules, we demonstrate that
the resulting decompositions can often be understood in a crisp manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08574v1,,False
GenPlan: Generative sequence models as adaptive planners,11/12/2024,"Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant","Offline reinforcement learning has shown tremendous success in behavioral
planning by learning from previously collected demonstrations. However,
decision-making in multitask missions still presents significant challenges.
For instance, a mission might require an agent to explore an unknown
environment, discover goals, and navigate to them, even if it involves
interacting with obstacles along the way. Such behavioral planning problems are
difficult to solve due to: a) agents failing to adapt beyond the single task
learned through their reward function, and b) the inability to generalize to
new environments not covered in the training demonstrations, e.g., environments
where all doors were unlocked in the demonstrations. Consequently,
state-of-the-art decision making methods are limited to missions where the
required tasks are well-represented in the training demonstrations and can be
solved within a short (temporal) planning horizon. To address this, we propose
GenPlan: a stochastic and adaptive planner that leverages discrete-flow models
for generative sequence modeling, enabling sample-efficient exploration and
exploitation. This framework relies on an iterative denoising procedure to
generate a sequence of goals and actions. This approach captures multi-modal
action distributions and facilitates goal and task discovery, thereby enhancing
generalization to out-of-distribution tasks and environments, i.e., missions
not part of the training data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through multiple simulation environments. Notably, GenPlan outperforms the
state-of-the-art methods by over 10% on adaptive planning tasks, where the
agent adapts to multi-task missions while leveraging demonstrations on
single-goal-reaching tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08565v1,,False
From Multimodal LLMs to Generalist Embodied Agents: Methods and Lessons,11/12/2024,"Andrew Szot, Bogdan Mazoure, Omar Attia, Aleksei Timofeev, Harsh Agrawal, Devon Hjelm, Zhe Gan, Zsolt Kira, Alexander Toshev","We examine the capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
tackle diverse domains that extend beyond the traditional language and vision
tasks these models are typically trained on. Specifically, our focus lies in
areas such as Embodied AI, Games, UI Control, and Planning. To this end, we
introduce a process of adapting an MLLM to a Generalist Embodied Agent (GEA).
GEA is a single unified model capable of grounding itself across these varied
domains through a multi-embodiment action tokenizer. GEA is trained with
supervised learning on a large dataset of embodied experiences and with online
RL in interactive simulators. We explore the data and algorithmic choices
necessary to develop such a model. Our findings reveal the importance of
training with cross-domain data and online RL for building generalist agents.
The final GEA model achieves strong generalization performance to unseen tasks
across diverse benchmarks compared to other generalist models and
benchmark-specific approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08442v1,,False
Proactive Model Adaptation Against Concept Drift for Online Time Series Forecasting,11/12/2024,"Lifan Zhao, Yanyan Shen","Time series forecasting always faces the challenge of concept drift, where
data distributions evolve over time, leading to a decline in forecast model
performance. Existing solutions are based on online learning, which continually
organize recent time series observations as new training samples and update
model parameters according to the forecasting feedback on recent data. However,
they overlook a critical issue: obtaining ground-truth future values of each
sample should be delayed until after the forecast horizon. This delay creates a
temporal gap between the training samples and the test sample. Our empirical
analysis reveals that the gap can introduce concept drift, causing forecast
models to adapt to outdated concepts. In this paper, we present
\textsc{Proceed}, a novel proactive model adaptation framework for online time
series forecasting. \textsc{Proceed} first operates by estimating the concept
drift between the recently used training samples and the current test sample.
It then employs an adaptation generator to efficiently translate the estimated
drift into parameter adjustments, proactively adapting the model to the test
sample. To enhance the generalization capability of the framework,
\textsc{Proceed} is trained on synthetic diverse concept drifts. We conduct
extensive experiments on five real-world datasets across various forecast
models. The empirical study demonstrates that our proposed \textsc{Proceed}
brings more performance improvements than the state-of-the-art online learning
methods, significantly facilitating forecast models' resilience against concept
drifts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08435v1,,False
SwarmGPT-Primitive: A Language-Driven Choreographer for Drone Swarms Using Safe Motion Primitive Composition,11/12/2024,"Vedant Vyas, Martin Schuck, Dinushka O. Dahanaggamaarachchi, Siqi Zhou, Angela P. Schoellig","Catalyzed by advancements in hardware and software, drone performances are
increasingly making their mark in the entertainment industry. However,
designing smooth and safe choreographies for drone swarms is complex and often
requires expert domain knowledge. In this work, we introduce
SwarmGPT-Primitive, a language-based choreographer that integrates the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with safe motion
planning to facilitate deployable drone swarm choreographies. The LLM composes
choreographies for a given piece of music by utilizing a library of motion
primitives; the language-based choreographer is augmented with an
optimization-based safety filter, which certifies the choreography for
real-world deployment by making minimal adjustments when feasibility and safety
constraints are violated. The overall SwarmGPT-Primitive framework decouples
choreographic design from safe motion planning, which allows non-expert users
to re-prompt and refine compositions without concerns about compliance with
constraints such as avoiding collisions or downwash effects or satisfying
actuation limits. We demonstrate our approach through simulations and
experiments with swarms of up to 20 drones performing choreographies designed
based on various songs, highlighting the system's ability to generate effective
and synchronized drone choreographies for real-world deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08428v1,,False
Grasp Diffusion Network: Learning Grasp Generators from Partial Point Clouds with Diffusion Models in SO(3)xR3,11/12/2024,"Joao Carvalho, An T. Le, Philipp Jahr, Qiao Sun, Julen Urain, Dorothea Koert, Jan Peters","Grasping objects successfully from a single-view camera is crucial in many
robot manipulation tasks. An approach to solve this problem is to leverage
simulation to create large datasets of pairs of objects and grasp poses, and
then learn a conditional generative model that can be prompted quickly during
deployment. However, the grasp pose data is highly multimodal since there are
several ways to grasp an object. Hence, in this work, we learn a grasp
generative model with diffusion models to sample candidate grasp poses given a
partial point cloud of an object. A novel aspect of our method is to consider
diffusion in the manifold space of rotations and to propose a
collision-avoidance cost guidance to improve the grasp success rate during
inference. To accelerate grasp sampling we use recent techniques from the
diffusion literature to achieve faster inference times. We show in simulation
and real-world experiments that our approach can grasp several objects from raw
depth images with $90\%$ success rate and benchmark it against several
baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08398v1,,False
Towards Automated Algebraic Multigrid Preconditioner Design Using Genetic Programming for Large-Scale Laser Beam Welding Simulations,11/12/2024,"Dinesh Parthasarathy, Tommaso Bevilacqua, Martin Lanser, Axel Klawonn, Harald K√∂stler","Multigrid methods are asymptotically optimal algorithms ideal for large-scale
simulations. But, they require making numerous algorithmic choices that
significantly influence their efficiency. Unlike recent approaches that learn
optimal multigrid components using machine learning techniques, we adopt a
complementary strategy here, employing evolutionary algorithms to construct
efficient multigrid cycles from available individual components. This
technology is applied to finite element simulations of the laser beam welding
process. The thermo-elastic behavior is described by a coupled system of
time-dependent thermo-elasticity equations, leading to nonlinear and
ill-conditioned systems. The nonlinearity is addressed using Newton's method,
and iterative solvers are accelerated with an algebraic multigrid (AMG)
preconditioner using hypre BoomerAMG interfaced via PETSc. This is applied as a
monolithic solver for the coupled equations. To further enhance solver
efficiency, flexible AMG cycles are introduced, extending traditional cycle
types with level-specific smoothing sequences and non-recursive cycling
patterns. These are automatically generated using genetic programming, guided
by a context-free grammar containing AMG rules. Numerical experiments
demonstrate the potential of these approaches to improve solver performance in
large-scale laser beam welding simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08186v1,,False
Evil twins are not that evil: Qualitative insights into machine-generated prompts,11/12/2024,"Nathana√´l Carraz Rakotonirina, Corentin Kervadec, Francesca Franzon, Marco Baroni","It has been widely observed that language models (LMs) respond in predictable
ways to algorithmically generated prompts that are seemingly unintelligible.
This is both a sign that we lack a full understanding of how LMs work, and a
practical challenge, because opaqueness can be exploited for harmful uses of
LMs, such as jailbreaking. We present the first thorough analysis of opaque
machine-generated prompts, or autoprompts, pertaining to 3 LMs of different
sizes and families. We find that machine-generated prompts are characterized by
a last token that is often intelligible and strongly affects the generation. A
small but consistent proportion of the previous tokens are fillers that
probably appear in the prompt as a by-product of the fact that the optimization
process fixes the number of tokens. The remaining tokens tend to have at least
a loose semantic relation with the generation, although they do not engage in
well-formed syntactic relations with it. We find moreover that some of the
ablations we applied to machine-generated prompts can also be applied to
natural language sequences, leading to similar behavior, suggesting that
autoprompts are a direct consequence of the way in which LMs process linguistic
inputs in general.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08127v1,,False
Dense Depth from Event Focal Stack,11/12/2024,"Kenta Horikawa, Mariko Isogawa, Hideo Saito, Shohei Mori","We propose a method for dense depth estimation from an event stream generated
when sweeping the focal plane of the driving lens attached to an event camera.
In this method, a depth map is inferred from an ``event focal stack'' composed
of the event stream using a convolutional neural network trained with
synthesized event focal stacks. The synthesized event stream is created from a
focal stack generated by Blender for any arbitrary 3D scene. This allows for
training on scenes with diverse structures. Additionally, we explored methods
to eliminate the domain gap between real event streams and synthetic event
streams. Our method demonstrates superior performance over a depth-from-defocus
method in the image domain on synthetic and real datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08120v1,,False
Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Large Language Models for Time Series Forecasting,11/12/2024,"Fuqiang Liu, Sicong Jiang, Luis Miranda-Moreno, Seongjin Choi, Lijun Sun","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant potential
in the field of time series forecasting, offering impressive capabilities in
handling complex temporal data. However, their robustness and reliability in
real-world applications remain under-explored, particularly concerning their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks. In this paper, we introduce a targeted
adversarial attack framework for LLM-based time series forecasting. By
employing both gradient-free and black-box optimization methods, we generate
minimal yet highly effective perturbations that significantly degrade the
forecasting accuracy across multiple datasets and LLM architectures. Our
experiments, which include models like TimeGPT and LLM-Time with GPT-3.5,
GPT-4, LLaMa, and Mistral, show that adversarial attacks lead to much more
severe performance degradation than random noise, and demonstrate the broad
effectiveness of our attacks across different LLMs. The results underscore the
critical vulnerabilities of LLMs in time series forecasting, highlighting the
need for robust defense mechanisms to ensure their reliable deployment in
practical applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08099v1,,False
Dynamic Classification of Latent Disease Progression with Auxiliary Surrogate Labels,11/12/2024,"Zexi Cai, Donglin Zeng, Karen S. Marder, Lawrence S. Honig, Yuanjia Wang","Disease progression prediction based on patients' evolving health information
is challenging when true disease states are unknown due to diagnostic
capabilities or high costs. For example, the absence of gold-standard
neurological diagnoses hinders distinguishing Alzheimer's disease (AD) from
related conditions such as AD-related dementias (ADRDs), including Lewy body
dementia (LBD). Combining temporally dependent surrogate labels and health
markers may improve disease prediction. However, existing literature models
informative surrogate labels and observed variables that reflect the underlying
states using purely generative approaches, limiting the ability to predict
future states. We propose integrating the conventional hidden Markov model as a
generative model with a time-varying discriminative classification model to
simultaneously handle potentially misspecified surrogate labels and incorporate
important markers of disease progression. We develop an adaptive
forward-backward algorithm with subjective labels for estimation, and utilize
the modified posterior and Viterbi algorithms to predict the progression of
future states or new patients based on objective markers only. Importantly, the
adaptation eliminates the need to model the marginal distribution of
longitudinal markers, a requirement in traditional algorithms. Asymptotic
properties are established, and significant improvement with finite samples is
demonstrated via simulation studies. Analysis of the neuropathological dataset
of the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center (NACC) shows much improved
accuracy in distinguishing LBD from AD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08088v1,,False
Statistical Downscaling via High-Dimensional Distribution Matching with Generative Models,11/12/2024,"Zhong Yi Wan, Ignacio Lopez-Gomez, Robert Carver, Tapio Schneider, John Anderson, Fei Sha, Leonardo Zepeda-N√∫√±ez","Statistical downscaling is a technique used in climate modeling to increase
the resolution of climate simulations. High-resolution climate information is
essential for various high-impact applications, including natural hazard risk
assessment. However, simulating climate at high resolution is intractable.
Thus, climate simulations are often conducted at a coarse scale and then
downscaled to the desired resolution. Existing downscaling techniques are
either simulation-based methods with high computational costs, or statistical
approaches with limitations in accuracy or application specificity. We
introduce Generative Bias Correction and Super-Resolution (GenBCSR), a
two-stage probabilistic framework for statistical downscaling that overcomes
the limitations of previous methods. GenBCSR employs two transformations to
match high-dimensional distributions at different resolutions: (i) the first
stage, bias correction, aligns the distributions at coarse scale, (ii) the
second stage, statistical super-resolution, lifts the corrected coarse
distribution by introducing fine-grained details. Each stage is instantiated by
a state-of-the-art generative model, resulting in an efficient and effective
computational pipeline for the well-studied distribution matching problem. By
framing the downscaling problem as distribution matching, GenBCSR relaxes the
constraints of supervised learning, which requires samples to be aligned.
Despite not requiring such correspondence, we show that GenBCSR surpasses
standard approaches in predictive accuracy of critical impact variables,
particularly in predicting the tails (99% percentile) of composite indexes
composed of interacting variables, achieving up to 4-5 folds of error
reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08079v1,,False
DialogAgent: An Auto-engagement Agent for Code Question Answering Data Production,11/12/2024,"Xiaoyun Liang, Jingyi Ren, Jiayi Qi, Chao Peng, Bo Jiang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly integral to enhancing

enables the production of diverse, high-fidelity query-response pairs by
simulating multi-turn dialogues and contextual behaviors observed in real-world

DynamicPAE: Generating Scene-Aware Physical Adversarial Examples in Real-Time,11/12/2024,"Jin Hu, Xianglong Liu, Jiakai Wang, Junkai Zhang, Xianqi Yang, Haotong Qin, Yuqing Ma, Ke Xu","Physical adversarial examples (PAEs) are regarded as ""whistle-blowers"" of
real-world risks in deep-learning applications. However, current PAE generation
studies show limited adaptive attacking ability to diverse and varying scenes.
The key challenges in generating dynamic PAEs are exploring their patterns
under noisy gradient feedback and adapting the attack to agnostic scenario
natures. To address the problems, we present DynamicPAE, the first generative
framework that enables scene-aware real-time physical attacks beyond static
attacks. Specifically, to train the dynamic PAE generator under noisy gradient
feedback, we introduce the residual-driven sample trajectory guidance
technique, which redefines the training task to break the limited feedback
information restriction that leads to the degeneracy problem. Intuitively, it
allows the gradient feedback to be passed to the generator through a low-noise
auxiliary task, thereby guiding the optimization away from degenerate solutions
and facilitating a more comprehensive and stable exploration of feasible PAEs.
To adapt the generator to agnostic scenario natures, we introduce the
context-aligned scene expectation simulation process, consisting of the
conditional-uncertainty-aligned data module and the skewness-aligned objective
re-weighting module. The former enhances robustness in the context of
incomplete observation by employing a conditional probabilistic model for
domain randomization, while the latter facilitates consistent stealth control
across different attack targets by automatically reweighting losses based on
the skewness indicator. Extensive digital and physical evaluations demonstrate
the superior attack performance of DynamicPAE, attaining a 1.95 $\times$ boost
(65.55% average AP drop under attack) on representative object detectors (e.g.,
Yolo-v8) over state-of-the-art static PAE generating methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.08053v1,,False

Accurate Prediction of Temperature Indicators in Eastern China Using a Multi-Scale CNN-LSTM-Attention model,11/12/2024,"Jiajiang Shen, Weiyan Wu, Qianyu Xu","In recent years, the importance of accurate weather forecasting has become
increasingly prominent due to the impacts of global climate change and the
