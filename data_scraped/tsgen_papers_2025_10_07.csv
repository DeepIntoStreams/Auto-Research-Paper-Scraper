"Finish First, Perfect Later: Test-Time Token-Level Cross-Validation for Diffusion Large Language Models",06/10/2025,"Runchu Tian, Junxia Cui, Xueqiang Xu, Feng Yao, Jingbo Shang","Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) models, offering advantages such as
accelerated parallel decoding and bidirectional context modeling. However, the
vanilla decoding strategy in discrete dLLMs suffers from a critical limitation:
once a token is accepted, it can no longer be revised in subsequent steps. As a
result, early mistakes persist across iterations, harming both intermediate
predictions and final output quality. To address this issue, we propose
Tolerator (Token-Level Cross-Validation Refinement), a training-free decoding
strategy that leverages cross-validation among predicted tokens. Unlike
existing methods that follow a single progressive unmasking procedure,
Tolerator introduces a two-stage process: (i) sequence fill-up and (ii)
iterative refinement by remasking and decoding a subset of tokens while
treating the remaining as context. This design enables previously accepted
tokens to be reconsidered and corrected when necessary, leading to more
reliable diffusion decoding outputs. We evaluate Tolerator on five standard
benchmarks covering language understanding, code generation, and mathematics.
Experiments show that our method achieves consistent improvements over the
baselines under the same computational budget. These findings suggest that
decoding algorithms are crucial to realizing the full potential of diffusion
large language models. Code and data are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05090v1,,False
ResMimic: From General Motion Tracking to Humanoid Whole-body Loco-Manipulation via Residual Learning,06/10/2025,"Siheng Zhao, Yanjie Ze, Yue Wang, C. Karen Liu, Pieter Abbeel, Guanya Shi, Rocky Duan","Humanoid whole-body loco-manipulation promises transformative capabilities
for daily service and warehouse tasks. While recent advances in general motion
tracking (GMT) have enabled humanoids to reproduce diverse human motions, these
policies lack the precision and object awareness required for
loco-manipulation. To this end, we introduce ResMimic, a two-stage residual
learning framework for precise and expressive humanoid control from human
motion data. First, a GMT policy, trained on large-scale human-only motion,
serves as a task-agnostic base for generating human-like whole-body movements.
An efficient but precise residual policy is then learned to refine the GMT
outputs to improve locomotion and incorporate object interaction. To further
facilitate efficient training, we design (i) a point-cloud-based object
tracking reward for smoother optimization, (ii) a contact reward that
encourages accurate humanoid body-object interactions, and (iii) a
curriculum-based virtual object controller to stabilize early training. We
evaluate ResMimic in both simulation and on a real Unitree G1 humanoid. Results
show substantial gains in task success, training efficiency, and robustness
over strong baselines. Videos are available at https://resmimic.github.io/ .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05070v1,,False
Staircase Streaming for Low-Latency Multi-Agent Inference,06/10/2025,"Junlin Wang, Jue Wang, Zhen, Xu, Ben Athiwaratkun, Bhuwan Dhingra, Ce Zhang, James Zou","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) opened up new directions for
leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs. These methods, such as
Mixture-of-Agents, typically employ additional inference steps to generate
intermediate outputs, which are then used to produce the final response. While
multi-agent inference can enhance response quality, it can significantly
increase the time to first token (TTFT), posing a challenge for
latency-sensitive applications and hurting user experience. To address this
issue, we propose staircase streaming for low-latency multi-agent inference.
Instead of waiting for the complete intermediate outputs from previous steps,
we begin generating the final response as soon as we receive partial outputs
from these steps. Experimental results demonstrate that staircase streaming
reduces TTFT by up to 93% while maintaining response quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05059v1,,False
Modeling Student Learning with 3.8 Million Program Traces,06/10/2025,"Alexis Ross, Megha Srivastava, Jeremiah Blanchard, Jacob Andreas","As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating
rich ""interaction traces"" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and
provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in
particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to
code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept
works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic
choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language
models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and
particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8
million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online
educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts.
Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated
traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling
diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also
find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number
of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who
write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover
from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of
edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the
original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of
code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can
lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior
while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

Test-Time Scaling in Diffusion LLMs via Hidden Semi-Autoregressive Experts,06/10/2025,"Jihoon Lee, Hoyeon Moon, Kevin Zhai, Arun Kumar Chithanar, Anit Kumar Sahu, Soummya Kar, Chul Lee, Souradip Chakraborty, Amrit Singh Bedi","Diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) are trained flexibly to model
extreme dependence in the data distribution; however, how to best utilize this
information at inference time remains an open problem. In this work, we uncover
an interesting property of these models: dLLMs trained on textual data
implicitly learn a mixture of semi-autoregressive experts, where different
generation orders reveal different specialized behaviors. We show that
committing to any single, fixed inference time schedule, a common practice,
collapses performance by failing to leverage this latent ensemble. To address
this, we introduce HEX (Hidden semiautoregressive EXperts for test-time
scaling), a training-free inference method that ensembles across heterogeneous
block schedules. By doing a majority vote over diverse block-sized generation
paths, HEX robustly avoids failure modes associated with any single fixed
schedule. On reasoning benchmarks such as GSM8K, it boosts accuracy by up to
3.56X (from 24.72% to 88.10%), outperforming top-K margin inference and
specialized fine-tuned methods like GRPO, without additional training. HEX even
yields significant gains on MATH benchmark from 16.40% to 40.00%, scientific
reasoning on ARC-C from 54.18% to 87.80%, and TruthfulQA from 28.36% to 57.46%.
Our results establish a new paradigm for test-time scaling in diffusion-based
LLMs (dLLMs), revealing that the sequence in which masking is performed plays a
critical role in determining performance during inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05040v1,,False
Graph-Aware Diffusion for Signal Generation,06/10/2025,"Sergio Rozada, Vimal K. B., Andrea Cavallo, Antonio G. Marques, Hadi Jamali-Rad, Elvin Isufi","We study the problem of generating graph signals from unknown distributions
defined over given graphs, relevant to domains such as recommender systems or
sensor networks. Our approach builds on generative diffusion models, which are
well established in vision and graph generation but remain underexplored for
graph signals. Existing methods lack generality, either ignoring the graph
structure in the forward process or designing graph-aware mechanisms tailored
to specific domains. We adopt a forward process that incorporates the graph
through the heat equation. Rather than relying on the standard formulation, we
consider a time-warped coefficient to mitigate the exponential decay of the
drift term, yielding a graph-aware generative diffusion model (GAD). We analyze
its forward dynamics, proving convergence to a Gaussian Markov random field
with covariance parametrized by the graph Laplacian, and interpret the backward
dynamics as a sequence of graph-signal denoising problems. Finally, we
demonstrate the advantages of GAD on synthetic data, real traffic speed
measurements, and a temperature sensor network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05036v1,,False
Curiosity-Driven Co-Development of Action and Language in Robots Through Self-Exploration,06/10/2025,"Theodore Jerome Tinker, Kenji Doya, Jun Tani","Human infants acquire language and action co-developmentally, achieving
remarkable generalization capabilities from only a minimal number of learning
examples. In contrast, recent large language models require exposure to
billions of training tokens to achieve such generalization. What mechanisms
underlie such efficient developmental learning in humans? This study addresses
this question through simulation experiments in which robots learn to perform
various actions corresponding to imperative sentences (e.g., \textit{push red
cube}) via trials of self-guided exploration. Our approach integrates the
active inference framework with reinforcement learning, enabling
curiosity-driven developmental learning. The simulations yielded several
nontrivial findings: i) Curiosity-driven exploration combined with motor noise
substantially outperforms learning without curiosity. ii) Simpler,
prerequisite-like actions emerge earlier in development, while more complex
actions involving these prerequisites develop later. iii) Rote pairing of
sentences and actions occurs before the emergence of compositional
generalization. iv) Generalization is drastically improved as the number of
compositional elements increases. These results shed light into possible
mechanisms underlying efficient co-developmental learning in infants and
provide computational parallels to findings in developmental psychology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.05013v1,,False
On Structured State-Space Duality,06/10/2025,"Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Xiwen Zhang, Weimin Wu, Han Liu","Structured State-Space Duality (SSD) [Dao & Gu, ICML 2024] is an equivalence
between a simple Structured State-Space Model (SSM) and a masked attention
mechanism. In particular, a state-space model with a scalar-times-identity
state matrix is equivalent to a masked self-attention with a $1$-semiseparable
causal mask. Consequently, the same sequence transformation (model) has two
algorithmic realizations: as a linear-time $O(T)$ recurrence or as a
quadratic-time $O(T^2)$ attention. In this note, we formalize and generalize
this duality: (i) we extend SSD from the scalar-identity case to general
diagonal SSMs (diagonal state matrices); (ii) we show that these diagonal SSMs
match the scalar case's training complexity lower bounds while supporting
richer dynamics; (iii) we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under
which an SSM is equivalent to $1$-semiseparable masked attention; and (iv) we
show that such duality fails to extend to standard softmax attention due to
rank explosion. Together, these results tighten bridge between recurrent SSMs
and Transformers, and widen the design space for expressive yet efficient
sequence models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04944v1,,False
Glocal Information Bottleneck for Time Series Imputation,06/10/2025,"Jie Yang, Kexin Zhang, Guibin Zhang, Philip S. Yu, Kaize Ding","Time Series Imputation (TSI), which aims to recover missing values in
temporal data, remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex and often
high-rate missingness in real-world scenarios. Existing models typically
optimize the point-wise reconstruction loss, focusing on recovering numerical
values (local information). However, we observe that under high missing rates,
these models still perform well in the training phase yet produce poor
imputations and distorted latent representation distributions (global
information) in the inference phase. This reveals a critical optimization
dilemma: current objectives lack global guidance, leading models to overfit
local noise and fail to capture global information of the data. To address this
issue, we propose a new training paradigm, Glocal Information Bottleneck
(Glocal-IB). Glocal-IB is model-agnostic and extends the standard IB framework
by introducing a Global Alignment loss, derived from a tractable mutual
information approximation. This loss aligns the latent representations of
masked inputs with those of their originally observed counterparts. It helps
the model retain global structure and local details while suppressing noise
caused by missing values, giving rise to better generalization under high
missingness. Extensive experiments on nine datasets confirm that Glocal-IB
leads to consistently improved performance and aligned latent representations
under missingness. Our code implementation is available in
https://github.com/Muyiiiii/NeurIPS-25-Glocal-IB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04910v1,,False
How Different from the Past? Spatio-Temporal Time Series Forecasting with Self-Supervised Deviation Learning,06/10/2025,"Haotian Gao, Zheng Dong, Jiawei Yong, Shintaro Fukushima, Kenjiro Taura, Renhe Jiang","Spatio-temporal forecasting is essential for real-world applications such as
traffic management and urban computing. Although recent methods have shown
improved accuracy, they often fail to account for dynamic deviations between
current inputs and historical patterns. These deviations contain critical
signals that can significantly affect model performance. To fill this gap, we
propose ST-SSDL, a Spatio-Temporal time series forecasting framework that
incorporates a Self-Supervised Deviation Learning scheme to capture and utilize
such deviations. ST-SSDL anchors each input to its historical average and
discretizes the latent space using learnable prototypes that represent typical
spatio-temporal patterns. Two auxiliary objectives are proposed to refine this
structure: a contrastive loss that enhances inter-prototype discriminability
and a deviation loss that regularizes the distance consistency between input
representations and corresponding prototypes to quantify deviation. Optimized
jointly with the forecasting objective, these components guide the model to
organize its hidden space and improve generalization across diverse input
conditions. Experiments on six benchmark datasets show that ST-SSDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics.
Visualizations further demonstrate its ability to adaptively respond to varying
levels of deviation in complex spatio-temporal scenarios. Our code and datasets
are available at https://github.com/Jimmy-7664/ST-SSDL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04908v1,,False
Benchmarking M-LTSF: Frequency and Noise-Based Evaluation of Multivariate Long Time Series Forecasting Models,06/10/2025,"Nick Janßen, Melanie Schaller, Bodo Rosenhahn","Understanding the robustness of deep learning models for multivariate
long-term time series forecasting (M-LTSF) remains challenging, as evaluations
typically rely on real-world datasets with unknown noise properties. We propose
a simulation-based evaluation framework that generates parameterizable
synthetic datasets, where each dataset instance corresponds to a different
configuration of signal components, noise types, signal-to-noise ratios, and
frequency characteristics. These configurable components aim to model
real-world multivariate time series data without the ambiguity of unknown
noise. This framework enables fine-grained, systematic evaluation of M-LTSF
models under controlled and diverse scenarios. We benchmark four representative
architectures S-Mamba (state-space), iTransformer (transformer-based), R-Linear
(linear), and Autoformer (decomposition-based). Our analysis reveals that all
models degrade severely when lookback windows cannot capture complete periods
of seasonal patters in the data. S-Mamba and Autoformer perform best on
sawtooth patterns, while R-Linear and iTransformer favor sinusoidal signals.
White and Brownian noise universally degrade performance with lower
signal-to-noise ratio while S-Mamba shows specific trend-noise and iTransformer
shows seasonal-noise vulnerability. Further spectral analysis shows that
S-Mamba and iTransformer achieve superior frequency reconstruction. This
controlled approach, based on our synthetic and principle-driven testbed,
offers deeper insights into model-specific strengths and limitations through
the aggregation of MSE scores and provides concrete guidance for model
selection based on signal characteristics and noise conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04900v1,,False
Revealing Interconnections between Diseases: from Statistical Methods to Large Language Models,06/10/2025,"Alina Ermilova, Dmitrii Kornilov, Sofia Samoilova, Ekaterina Laptenkova, Anastasia Kolesnikova, Ekaterina Podplutova, Senotrusova Sofya, Maksim G. Sharaev","Identifying disease interconnections through manual analysis of large-scale
clinical data is labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to expert disagreement.
While machine learning (ML) shows promise, three critical challenges remain:
(1) selecting optimal methods from the vast ML landscape, (2) determining
whether real-world clinical data (e.g., electronic health records, EHRs) or
structured disease descriptions yield more reliable insights, (3) the lack of
""ground truth,"" as some disease interconnections remain unexplored in medicine.
Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate broad utility, yet they often lack
specialized medical knowledge. To address these gaps, we conduct a systematic
evaluation of seven approaches for uncovering disease relationships based on
two data sources: (i) sequences of ICD-10 codes from MIMIC-IV EHRs and (ii) the
full set of ICD-10 codes, both with and without textual descriptions. Our
framework integrates the following: (i) a statistical co-occurrence analysis
and a masked language modeling (MLM) approach using real clinical data; (ii)
domain-specific BERT variants (Med-BERT and BioClinicalBERT); (iii) a
general-purpose BERT and document retrieval; and (iv) four LLMs (Mistral,
DeepSeek, Qwen, and YandexGPT). Our graph-based comparison of the obtained
interconnection matrices shows that the LLM-based approach produces
interconnections with the lowest diversity of ICD code connections to different
diseases compared to other methods, including text-based and domain-based
approaches. This suggests an important implication: LLMs have limited potential
for discovering new interconnections. In the absence of ground truth databases
for medical interconnections between ICD codes, our results constitute a
valuable medical disease ontology that can serve as a foundational resource for
future clinical research and artificial intelligence applications in
healthcare.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04888v1,,False
A Noise Resilient Approach for Robust Hurst Exponent Estimation,06/10/2025,"Malith Premarathna, Fabrizio Ruggeri, Dixon Vimalajeewa","Understanding signal behavior across scales is vital in areas such as natural
phenomena analysis and financial modeling. A key property is self-similarity,
quantified by the Hurst exponent (H), which reveals long-term dependencies.
Wavelet-based methods are effective for estimating H due to their multi-scale
analysis capability, but additive noise in real-world measurements often
degrades accuracy. We propose Noise-Controlled ALPHEE (NC-ALPHEE), an
enhancement of the Average Level-Pairwise Hurst Exponent Estimator (ALPHEE),
incorporating noise mitigation and generating multiple level-pairwise estimates
from signal energy pairs. A neural network (NN) combines these estimates,
replacing traditional averaging. This adaptive learning maintains ALPHEE's
behavior in noise-free cases while improving performance in noisy conditions.
Extensive simulations show that in noise-free data, NC-ALPHEE matches ALPHEE's
accuracy using both averaging and NN-based methods. Under noise, however,
traditional averaging deteriorates and requires impractical level restrictions,
while NC-ALPHEE consistently outperforms existing techniques without such
constraints. NC-ALPHEE offers a robust, adaptive approach for H estimation,
significantly enhancing the reliability of wavelet-based methods in noisy
environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04811v1,,False

LMM-Incentive: Large Multimodal Model-based Incentive Design for User-Generated Content in Web 3.0,06/10/2025,"Jinbo Wen, Jiawen Kang, Linfeng Zhang, Xiaoying Tang, Jianhang Tang, Yang Zhang, Zhaohui Yang, Dusit Niyato","Web 3.0 represents the next generation of the Internet, which is widely
recognized as a decentralized ecosystem that focuses on value expression and
data ownership. By leveraging blockchain and artificial intelligence
technologies, Web 3.0 offers unprecedented opportunities for users to create,
own, and monetize their content, thereby enabling User-Generated Content (UGC)
to an entirely new level. However, some self-interested users may exploit the
limitations of content curation mechanisms and generate low-quality content
with less effort, obtaining platform rewards under information asymmetry. Such
behavior can undermine Web 3.0 performance. To this end, we propose
\textit{LMM-Incentive}, a novel Large Multimodal Model (LMM)-based incentive
mechanism for UGC in Web 3.0. Specifically, we propose an LMM-based
contract-theoretic model to motivate users to generate high-quality UGC,
thereby mitigating the adverse selection problem from information asymmetry. To
alleviate potential moral hazards after contract selection, we leverage LMM
agents to evaluate UGC quality, which is the primary component of the contract,
utilizing prompt engineering techniques to improve the evaluation performance
of LMM agents. Recognizing that traditional contract design methods cannot
effectively adapt to the dynamic environment of Web 3.0, we develop an improved
Mixture of Experts (MoE)-based Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm for
optimal contract design. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the
proposed MoE-based PPO algorithm over representative benchmarks in the context
of contract design. Finally, we deploy the designed contract within an Ethereum
smart contract framework, further validating the effectiveness of the proposed
scheme.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04765v1,,False
"Speak, Edit, Repeat: High-Fidelity Voice Editing and Zero-Shot TTS with Cross-Attentive Mamba",06/10/2025,"Baher Mohammad, Magauiya Zhussip, Stamatios Lefkimmiatis","We introduce MAVE (Mamba with Cross-Attention for Voice Editing and
Synthesis), a novel autoregressive architecture for text-conditioned voice
editing and high-fidelity text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis, built on a
cross-attentive Mamba backbone. MAVE achieves state-of-the-art performance in
speech editing and very competitive results in zero-shot TTS, while not being
explicitly trained on the latter task, outperforming leading autoregressive and
diffusion models on diverse, real-world audio. By integrating Mamba for
efficient audio sequence modeling with cross-attention for precise
text-acoustic alignment, MAVE enables context-aware voice editing with
exceptional naturalness and speaker consistency. In pairwise human evaluations
on a random 40-sample subset of the RealEdit benchmark (400 judgments), 57.2%
of listeners rated MAVE - edited speech as perceptually equal to the original,
while 24.8% prefered the original and 18.0% MAVE - demonstrating that in the
majority of cases edits are indistinguishable from the source. MAVE compares
favorably with VoiceCraft and FluentSpeech both on pairwise comparisons and
standalone mean opinion score (MOS) evaluations. For zero-shot TTS, MAVE
exceeds VoiceCraft in both speaker similarity and naturalness, without
requiring multiple inference runs or post-processing. Remarkably, these quality
gains come with a significantly lower memory cost and approximately the same
latency: MAVE requires ~6x less memory than VoiceCraft during inference on
utterances from the RealEdit database (mean duration: 6.21s, A100, FP16, batch
size 1). Our results demonstrate that MAVE establishes a new standard for
flexible, high-fidelity voice editing and synthesis through the synergistic
integration of structured state-space modeling and cross-modal attention.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04738v1,,False
ViTs: Teaching Machines to See Time Series Anomalies Like Human Experts,06/10/2025,"Zexin Wang, Changhua Pei, Yang Liu, Hengyue Jiang, Quan Zhou, Haotian Si, Hang Cui, Jianhui Li, Gaogang Xie, Jingjing Li, Dan Pei","Web service administrators must ensure the stability of multiple systems by
promptly detecting anomalies in Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). Achieving
the goal of ""train once, infer across scenarios"" remains a fundamental
challenge for time series anomaly detection models. Beyond improving zero-shot
generalization, such models must also flexibly handle sequences of varying
lengths during inference, ranging from one hour to one week, without
retraining. Conventional approaches rely on sliding-window encoding and
self-supervised learning, which restrict inference to fixed-length inputs.
Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot
capabilities across general domains. However, when applied to time series data,
they face inherent limitations due to context length. To address this issue, we
propose ViTs, a Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based framework that converts time
series curves into visual representations. By rescaling time series images,
temporal dependencies are preserved while maintaining a consistent input size,
thereby enabling efficient processing of arbitrarily long sequences without
context constraints. Training VLMs for this purpose introduces unique
challenges, primarily due to the scarcity of aligned time series image-text
data. To overcome this, we employ an evolutionary algorithm to automatically
generate thousands of high-quality image-text pairs and design a three-stage
training pipeline consisting of: (1) time series knowledge injection, (2)
anomaly detection enhancement, and (3) anomaly reasoning refinement. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that ViTs substantially enhance the ability of VLMs to

the end of every individual round (anytime optimal). We investigate the
computational challenges associated with finding (anytime) optimal outcomes and
demonstrate that these problems are generally computationally intractable.
However, we provide approximation algorithms, fixed-parameter tractable
algorithms, and identify several special cases whereby the problem(s) can be

Forecasting-Based Biomedical Time-series Data Synthesis for Open Data and Robust AI,06/10/2025,"Youngjoon Lee, Seongmin Cho, Yehhyun Jo, Jinu Gong, Hyunjoo Jenny Lee, Joonhyuk Kang","The limited data availability due to strict privacy regulations and

Code World Models for General Game Playing,06/10/2025,"Wolfgang Lehrach, Daniel Hennes, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla, Xinghua Lou, Carter Wendelken, Zun Li, Antoine Dedieu, Jordi Grau-Moya, Marc Lanctot, Atil Iscen, John Schultz, Marcus Chiam, Ian Gemp, Piotr Zielinski, Satinder Singh, Kevin P. Murphy","Large Language Models (LLMs) reasoning abilities are increasingly being
applied to classical board and card games, but the dominant approach --
involving prompting for direct move generation -- has significant drawbacks. It
relies on the model's implicit fragile pattern-matching capabilities, leading
to frequent illegal moves and strategically shallow play. Here we introduce an
alternative approach: We use the LLM to translate natural language rules and
game trajectories into a formal, executable world model represented as Python
code. This generated model -- comprising functions for state transition, legal
move enumeration, and termination checks -- serves as a verifiable simulation
engine for high-performance planning algorithms like Monte Carlo tree search
(MCTS). In addition, we prompt the LLM to generate heuristic value functions
(to make MCTS more efficient), and inference functions (to estimate hidden
states in imperfect information games). Our method offers three distinct
advantages compared to directly using the LLM as a policy: (1) Verifiability:
The generated CWM serves as a formal specification of the game's rules,
allowing planners to algorithmically enumerate valid actions and avoid illegal
moves, contingent on the correctness of the synthesized model; (2) Strategic
Depth: We combine LLM semantic understanding with the deep search power of
classical planners; and (3) Generalization: We direct the LLM to focus on the
meta-task of data-to-code translation, enabling it to adapt to new games more
easily. We evaluate our agent on 10 different games, of which 4 are novel and
created for this paper. 5 of the games are fully observed (perfect
information), and 5 are partially observed (imperfect information). We find
that our method outperforms or matches Gemini 2.5 Pro in 9 out of the 10

Wavelet Predictive Representations for Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning,06/10/2025,"Min Wang, Xin Li, Ye He, Yao-Hui Li, Hasnaa Bennis, Riashat Islam, Mingzhong Wang","The real world is inherently non-stationary, with ever-changing factors, such
as weather conditions and traffic flows, making it challenging for agents to
adapt to varying environmental dynamics. Non-Stationary Reinforcement Learning
(NSRL) addresses this challenge by training agents to adapt rapidly to
sequences of distinct Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). However, existing NSRL
approaches often focus on tasks with regularly evolving patterns, leading to
limited adaptability in highly dynamic settings. Inspired by the success of
Wavelet analysis in time series modeling, specifically its ability to capture
signal trends at multiple scales, we propose WISDOM to leverage wavelet-domain
predictive task representations to enhance NSRL. WISDOM captures these
multi-scale features in evolving MDP sequences by transforming task
representation sequences into the wavelet domain, where wavelet coefficients
represent both global trends and fine-grained variations of non-stationary
changes. In addition to the auto-regressive modeling commonly employed in time
series forecasting, we devise a wavelet temporal difference (TD) update
operator to enhance tracking and prediction of MDP evolution. We theoretically
prove the convergence of this operator and demonstrate policy improvement with
wavelet task representations. Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that

Impatient Users Confuse AI Agents: High-fidelity Simulations of Human Traits for Testing Agents,06/10/2025,"Muyu He, Anand Kumar, Tsach Mackey, Meghana Rajeev, James Zou, Nazneen Rajani","Despite rapid progress in building conversational AI agents, robustness is
still largely untested. Small shifts in user behavior, such as being more
impatient, incoherent, or skeptical, can cause sharp drops in agent
performance, revealing how brittle current AI agents are. Today's benchmarks
fail to capture this fragility: agents may perform well under standard
evaluations but degrade spectacularly in more realistic and varied settings. We
address this robustness testing gap by introducing TraitBasis, a lightweight,
model-agnostic method for systematically stress testing AI agents. TraitBasis
learns directions in activation space corresponding to steerable user traits
(e.g., impatience or incoherence), which can be controlled, scaled, composed,
and applied at inference time without any fine-tuning or extra data. Using
TraitBasis, we extend $\tau$-Bench to $\tau$-Trait, where user behaviors are
altered via controlled trait vectors. We observe on average a 2%-30%
performance degradation on $\tau$-Trait across frontier models, highlighting
the lack of robustness of current AI agents to variations in user behavior.
Together, these results highlight both the critical role of robustness testing
and the promise of TraitBasis as a simple, data-efficient, and compositional
tool. By powering simulation-driven stress tests and training loops, TraitBasis
opens the door to building AI agents that remain reliable in the unpredictable
dynamics of real-world human interactions. We have open-sourced $\tau$-Trai
across four domains: airline, retail, telecom, and telehealth, so the community
can systematically QA their agents under realistic, behaviorally diverse
intents and trait scenarios: https://github.com/collinear-ai/tau-trait.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.04491v1,,False
