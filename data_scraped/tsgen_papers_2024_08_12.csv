Beyond Closure Models: Learning Chaotic-Systems via Physics-Informed Neural Operators,09/08/2024,"Chuwei Wang, Julius Berner, Zongyi Li, Di Zhou, Jiayun Wang, Jane Bae, Anima Anandkumar","Accurately predicting the long-term behavior of chaotic systems is crucial
for various applications such as climate modeling. However, achieving such
predictions typically requires iterative computations over a dense
spatiotemporal grid to account for the unstable nature of chaotic systems,
which is expensive and impractical in many real-world situations. An
alternative approach to such a full-resolved simulation is using a coarse grid
and then correcting its errors through a \textit{closure model}, which
approximates the overall information from fine scales not captured in the
coarse-grid simulation. Recently, ML approaches have been used for closure
modeling, but they typically require a large number of training samples from
expensive fully-resolved simulations (FRS). In this work, we prove an even more
fundamental limitation, i.e., the standard approach to learning closure models
suffers from a large approximation error for generic problems, no matter how
large the model is, and it stems from the non-uniqueness of the mapping. We
propose an alternative end-to-end learning approach using a physics-informed
neural operator (PINO) that overcomes this limitation by not using a closure
model or a coarse-grid solver. We first train the PINO model on data from a
coarse-grid solver and then fine-tune it with (a small amount of) FRS and
physics-based losses on a fine grid. The discretization-free nature of neural
operators means that they do not suffer from the restriction of a coarse grid
that closure models face, and they can provably approximate the long-term
statistics of chaotic systems. In our experiments, our PINO model achieves a
120x speedup compared to FRS with a relative error $\sim 5\%$. In contrast, the
closure model coupled with a coarse-grid solver is $58$x slower than PINO while
having a much higher error $\sim205\%$ when the closure model is trained on the
same FRS dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05177v1,,False
Beyond the Eye: A Relational Model for Early Dementia Detection Using Retinal OCTA Images,09/08/2024,"Shouyue Liu, Jinkui Hao, Yonghuai Liu, Huazhu Fu, Xinyu Guo, Shuting Zhang, Yitian Zhao","Early detection of dementia, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD) or mild
cognitive impairment (MCI), is essential to enable timely intervention and
potential treatment. Accurate detection of AD/MCI is challenging due to the
high complexity, cost, and often invasive nature of current diagnostic
techniques, which limit their suitability for large-scale population screening.
Given the shared embryological origins and physiological characteristics of the
retina and brain, retinal imaging is emerging as a potentially rapid and
cost-effective alternative for the identification of individuals with or at
high risk of AD. In this paper, we present a novel PolarNet+ that uses retinal
optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to discriminate early-onset AD
(EOAD) and MCI subjects from controls. Our method first maps OCTA images from
Cartesian coordinates to polar coordinates, allowing approximate sub-region
calculation to implement the clinician-friendly early treatment of diabetic
retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid analysis. We then introduce a multi-view module
to serialize and analyze the images along three dimensions for comprehensive,
clinically useful information extraction. Finally, we abstract the sequence
embedding into a graph, transforming the detection task into a general graph
classification problem. A regional relationship module is applied after the
multi-view module to excavate the relationship between the sub-regions. Such
regional relationship analyses validate known eye-brain links and reveal new
discriminative patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05117v1,,False
Generating novel experimental hypotheses from language models: A case study on cross-dative generalization,09/08/2024,"Kanishka Misra, Najoung Kim","Neural network language models (LMs) have been shown to successfully capture
complex linguistic knowledge. However, their utility for understanding language
acquisition is still debated. We contribute to this debate by presenting a case
study where we use LMs as simulated learners to derive novel experimental
hypotheses to be tested with humans. We apply this paradigm to study
cross-dative generalization (CDG): productive generalization of novel verbs
across dative constructions (she pilked me the ball/she pilked the ball to me)
-- acquisition of which is known to involve a large space of contextual
features -- using LMs trained on child-directed speech. We specifically ask:
""what properties of the training exposure facilitate a novel verb's
generalization to the (unmodeled) alternate construction?"" To answer this, we
systematically vary the exposure context in which a novel dative verb occurs in
terms of the properties of the theme and recipient, and then analyze the LMs'
usage of the novel verb in the unmodeled dative construction. We find LMs to
replicate known patterns of children's CDG, as a precondition to exploring
novel hypotheses. Subsequent simulations reveal a nuanced role of the features
of the novel verbs' exposure context on the LMs' CDG. We find CDG to be
facilitated when the first postverbal argument of the exposure context is
pronominal, definite, short, and conforms to the prototypical animacy
expectations of the exposure dative. These patterns are characteristic of
harmonic alignment in datives, where the argument with features ranking higher
on the discourse prominence scale tends to precede the other. This gives rise
to a novel hypothesis that CDG is facilitated insofar as the features of the
exposure context -- in particular, its first postverbal argument -- are
harmonically aligned. We conclude by proposing future experiments that can test
this hypothesis in children.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05086v1,,False
On expected signatures and signature cumulants in semimartingale models,09/08/2024,"Peter K. Friz, Paul P. Hager, Nikolas Tapia","The concept of signatures and expected signatures is vital in data science,
especially for sequential data analysis. The signature transform, a Cartan type
development, translates paths into high-dimensional feature vectors, capturing
their intrinsic characteristics. Under natural conditions, the expectation of
the signature determines the law of the signature, providing a statistical
summary of the data distribution. This property facilitates robust modeling and
inference in machine learning and stochastic processes. Building on previous
work by the present authors [Unified signature cumulants and generalized Magnus
expansions, FoM Sigma '22] we here revisit the actual computation of expected
signatures, in a general semimartingale setting. Several new formulae are
given. A log-transform of (expected) signatures leads to log-signatures
(signature cumulants), offering a significant reduction in complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05085v1,,False
Masked adversarial neural network for cell type deconvolution in spatial transcriptomics,09/08/2024,"Lin Huang, Xiaofei Liu, Shunfang Wang, Wenwen Min","Accurately determining cell type composition in disease-relevant tissues is
crucial for identifying disease targets. Most existing spatial transcriptomics
(ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging
to accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various
deconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use
single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference
to infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the
differences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial
learning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq
data. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the
differences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking
techniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate
noise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets,
demonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution. All code and
public datasets used in this paper are available at
https://github.com/wenwenmin/MACD and https://zenodo.org/records/12804822.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05065v1,,False
Variational Bayesian Phylogenetic Inference with Semi-implicit Branch Length Distributions,09/08/2024,"Tianyu Xie, Frederick A. Matsen IV, Marc A. Suchard, Cheng Zhang","Reconstructing the evolutionary history relating a collection of molecular
sequences is the main subject of modern Bayesian phylogenetic inference.
However, the commonly used Markov chain Monte Carlo methods can be inefficient
due to the complicated space of phylogenetic trees, especially when the number
of sequences is large. An alternative approach is variational Bayesian
phylogenetic inference (VBPI) which transforms the inference problem into an
optimization problem. While effective, the default diagonal lognormal
approximation for the branch lengths of the tree used in VBPI is often
insufficient to capture the complexity of the exact posterior. In this work, we
propose a more flexible family of branch length variational posteriors based on
semi-implicit hierarchical distributions using graph neural networks. We show
that this semi-implicit construction emits straightforward permutation
equivariant distributions, and therefore can handle the non-Euclidean branch
length space across different tree topologies with ease. To deal with the
intractable marginal probability of semi-implicit variational distributions, we
develop several alternative lower bounds for stochastic optimization. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method over baseline methods on
benchmark data examples, in terms of both marginal likelihood estimation and
branch length posterior approximation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05058v1,,False
Causal Discovery of Linear Non-Gaussian Causal Models with Unobserved Confounding,09/08/2024,"Daniela Schkoda, Elina Robeva, Mathias Drton","We consider linear non-Gaussian structural equation models that involve
latent confounding. In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but,
in general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects.
Instead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same
observational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these
causal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which
often suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of
latent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an
algorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The
algorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its
latent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from
the data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use
rank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove
asymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of
latent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation
studies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to
overcomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04907v1,,False
An Evaluation of Standard Statistical Models and LLMs on Time Series Forecasting,09/08/2024,"Rui Cao, Qiao Wang","This research examines the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in predicting
time series, with a specific focus on the LLMTIME model. Despite the
established effectiveness of LLMs in tasks such as text generation, language
translation, and sentiment analysis, this study highlights the key challenges
that large language models encounter in the context of time series prediction.
We assess the performance of LLMTIME across multiple datasets and introduce
classical almost periodic functions as time series to gauge its effectiveness.
The empirical results indicate that while large language models can perform
well in zero-shot forecasting for certain datasets, their predictive accuracy
diminishes notably when confronted with diverse time series data and
traditional signals. The primary finding of this study is that the predictive
capacity of LLMTIME, similar to other LLMs, significantly deteriorates when
dealing with time series data that contain both periodic and trend components,
as well as when the signal comprises complex frequency components.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04867v1,,False
MDS-GNN: A Mutual Dual-Stream Graph Neural Network on Graphs with Incomplete Features and Structure,09/08/2024,"Peng Yuan, Peng Tang","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful tools for analyzing and
learning representations from graph-structured data. A crucial prerequisite for
the outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph
information, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet
in real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various
uncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either
incomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss
inevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream
graph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning
between features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a)
reconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph
structure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed
node features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global
graph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process
mutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete
graphs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04845v1,,False
Improved Robustness for Deep Learning-based Segmentation of Multi-Center Myocardial Perfusion MRI Datasets Using Data Adaptive Uncertainty-guided Space-time Analysis,09/08/2024,"Dilek M. Yalcinkaya, Khalid Youssef, Bobak Heydari, Janet Wei, Noel Bairey Merz, Robert Judd, Rohan Dharmakumar, Orlando P. Simonetti, Jonathan W. Weinsaft, Subha V. Raman, Behzad Sharif","Background. Fully automatic analysis of myocardial perfusion MRI datasets
enables rapid and objective reporting of stress/rest studies in patients with
suspected ischemic heart disease. Developing deep learning techniques that can
analyze multi-center datasets despite limited training data and variations in
software and hardware is an ongoing challenge.
  Methods. Datasets from 3 medical centers acquired at 3T (n = 150 subjects)
were included: an internal dataset (inD; n = 95) and two external datasets
(exDs; n = 55) used for evaluating the robustness of the trained deep neural
network (DNN) models against differences in pulse sequence (exD-1) and scanner
vendor (exD-2). A subset of inD (n = 85) was used for training/validation of a
pool of DNNs for segmentation, all using the same spatiotemporal U-Net
architecture and hyperparameters but with different parameter initializations.
We employed a space-time sliding-patch analysis approach that automatically
yields a pixel-wise ""uncertainty map"" as a byproduct of the segmentation
process. In our approach, a given test case is segmented by all members of the
DNN pool and the resulting uncertainty maps are leveraged to automatically
select the ""best"" one among the pool of solutions.
  Results. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach performed similarly to the
established approach on the internal dataset (p = n.s.) whereas it
significantly outperformed on the external datasets (p < 0.005 for exD-1 and
exD-2). Moreover, the number of image series with ""failed"" segmentation was
significantly lower for the proposed vs. the established approach (4.3% vs.
17.1%, p < 0.0005).
  Conclusions. The proposed DAUGS analysis approach has the potential to
improve the robustness of deep learning methods for segmentation of
multi-center stress perfusion datasets with variations in the choice of pulse
sequence, site location or scanner vendor.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04805v1,,False
