Explicit Context-Driven Neural Acoustic Modeling for High-Fidelity RIR Generation,18/09/2025,"Chen Si, Qianyi Wu, Chaitanya Amballa, Romit Roy Choudhury","Realistic sound simulation plays a critical role in many applications. A key
element in sound simulation is the room impulse response (RIR), which
characterizes how sound propagates from a source to a listener within a given
space. Recent studies have applied neural implicit methods to learn RIR using
context information collected from the environment, such as scene images.
However, these approaches do not effectively leverage explicit geometric
information from the environment. To further exploit the potential of neural
implicit models with direct geometric features, we present Mesh-infused Neural
Acoustic Field (MiNAF), which queries a rough room mesh at given locations and
extracts distance distributions as an explicit representation of local context.
Our approach demonstrates that incorporating explicit local geometric features
can better guide the neural network in generating more accurate RIR
predictions. Through comparisons with conventional and state-of-the-art
baseline methods, we show that MiNAF performs competitively across various
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, we verify the robustness of MiNAF in datasets
with limited training samples, demonstrating an advance in high-fidelity sound
simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15210v1,,False
TITAN: A Trajectory-Informed Technique for Adaptive Parameter Freezing in Large-Scale VQE,18/09/2025,"Yifeng Peng, Xinyi Li, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Kaining Zhang, Zhiding Liang, Ying Wang, Yuxuan Du","Variational quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading candidate for harnessing
quantum computers to advance quantum chemistry and materials simulations, yet
its training efficiency deteriorates rapidly for large Hamiltonians. Two issues
underlie this bottleneck: (i) the no-cloning theorem imposes a linear growth in
circuit evaluations with the number of parameters per gradient step; and (ii)
deeper circuits encounter barren plateaus (BPs), leading to exponentially
increasing measurement overheads. To address these challenges, here we propose
a deep learning framework, dubbed Titan, which identifies and freezes inactive
parameters of a given ansatze at initialization for a specific class of
Hamiltonians, reducing the optimization overhead without sacrificing accuracy.
The motivation of Titan starts with our empirical findings that a subset of
parameters consistently has a negligible influence on training dynamics. Its
design combines a theoretically grounded data construction strategy, ensuring
each training example is informative and BP-resilient, with an adaptive neural
architecture that generalizes across ansatze of varying sizes. Across benchmark
transverse-field Ising models, Heisenberg models, and multiple molecule systems
up to 30 qubits, Titan achieves up to 3 times faster convergence and 40% to 60%
fewer circuit evaluations than state-of-the-art baselines, while matching or
surpassing their estimation accuracy. By proactively trimming parameter space,
Titan lowers hardware demands and offers a scalable path toward utilizing VQE
to advance practical quantum chemistry and materials science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15193v1,,False
Self-Improving Embodied Foundation Models,18/09/2025,"Seyed Kamyar Seyed Ghasemipour, Ayzaan Wahid, Jonathan Tompson, Pannag Sanketi, Igor Mordatch","Foundation models trained on web-scale data have revolutionized robotics, but
their application to low-level control remains largely limited to behavioral
cloning. Drawing inspiration from the success of the reinforcement learning
stage in fine-tuning large language models, we propose a two-stage
post-training approach for robotics. The first stage, Supervised Fine-Tuning
(SFT), fine-tunes pretrained foundation models using both: a) behavioral
cloning, and b) steps-to-go prediction objectives. In the second stage,
Self-Improvement, steps-to-go prediction enables the extraction of a
well-shaped reward function and a robust success detector, enabling a fleet of
robots to autonomously practice downstream tasks with minimal human
supervision. Through extensive experiments on real-world and simulated robot
embodiments, our novel post-training recipe unveils significant results on
Embodied Foundation Models. First, we demonstrate that the combination of SFT
and Self-Improvement is significantly more sample-efficient than scaling
imitation data collection for supervised learning, and that it leads to
policies with significantly higher success rates. Further ablations highlight
that the combination of web-scale pretraining and Self-Improvement is the key
to this sample-efficiency. Next, we demonstrate that our proposed combination
uniquely unlocks a capability that current methods cannot achieve: autonomously
practicing and acquiring novel skills that generalize far beyond the behaviors
observed in the imitation learning datasets used during training. These
findings highlight the transformative potential of combining pretrained
foundation models with online Self-Improvement to enable autonomous skill

Super-Linear: A Lightweight Pretrained Mixture of Linear Experts for Time Series Forecasting,18/09/2025,"Liran Nochumsohn, Raz Marshanski, Hedi Zisling, Omri Azencot","Time series forecasting (TSF) is critical in domains like energy, finance,
healthcare, and logistics, requiring models that generalize across diverse

Real-Time Streaming Mel Vocoding with Generative Flow Matching,18/09/2025,"Simon Welker, Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann","The task of Mel vocoding, i.e., the inversion of a Mel magnitude spectrogram

Forecasting and Visualizing Air Quality from Sky Images with Vision-Language Models,18/09/2025,"Mohammad Saleh Vahdatpour, Maryam Eyvazi, Yanqing Zhang","Air pollution remains a critical threat to public health and environmental
sustainability, yet conventional monitoring systems are often constrained by
limited spatial coverage and accessibility. This paper proposes an AI-driven
agent that predicts ambient air pollution levels from sky images and
synthesizes realistic visualizations of pollution scenarios using generative
modeling. Our approach combines statistical texture analysis with supervised
learning for pollution classification, and leverages vision-language model
(VLM)-guided image generation to produce interpretable representations of air
quality conditions. The generated visuals simulate varying degrees of
pollution, offering a foundation for user-facing interfaces that improve
transparency and support informed environmental decision-making. These outputs
can be seamlessly integrated into intelligent applications aimed at enhancing
situational awareness and encouraging behavioral responses based on real-time
forecasts. We validate our method using a dataset of urban sky images and
demonstrate its effectiveness in both pollution level estimation and
semantically consistent visual synthesis. The system design further
incorporates human-centered user experience principles to ensure accessibility,
clarity, and public engagement in air quality forecasting. To support scalable

Improving Internet Traffic Matrix Prediction via Time Series Clustering,18/09/2025,"Martha Cash, Alexander Wyglinski","We present a novel framework that leverages time series clustering to improve
internet traffic matrix (TM) prediction using deep learning (DL) models.
Traffic flows within a TM often exhibit diverse temporal behaviors, which can
hinder prediction accuracy when training a single model across all flows. To
address this, we propose two clustering strategies, source clustering and
histogram clustering, that group flows with similar temporal patterns prior to
model training. Clustering creates more homogeneous data subsets, enabling
models to capture underlying patterns more effectively and generalize better
than global prediction approaches that fit a single model to the entire TM.
Compared to existing TM prediction methods, our method reduces RMSE by up to
92\% for Abilene and 75\% for G\'EANT. In routing scenarios, our clustered
predictions also reduce maximum link utilization (MLU) bias by 18\% and 21\%,

Communication Efficient Split Learning of ViTs with Attention-based Double Compression,18/09/2025,"Federico Alvetreti, Jary Pomponi, Paolo Di Lorenzo, Simone Scardapane","This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient Split Learning (SL)
framework, named Attention-based Double Compression (ADC), which reduces the
communication overhead required for transmitting intermediate Vision
Transformers activations during the SL training process. ADC incorporates two
parallel compression strategies. The first one merges samples' activations that
are similar, based on the average attention score calculated in the last client
layer; this strategy is class-agnostic, meaning that it can also merge samples
having different classes, without losing generalization ability nor decreasing
final results. The second strategy follows the first and discards the least
meaningful tokens, further reducing the communication cost. Combining these
strategies not only allows for sending less during the forward pass, but also
the gradients are naturally compressed, allowing the whole model to be trained
without additional tuning or approximations of the gradients. Simulation
results demonstrate that Attention-based Double Compression outperforms
state-of-the-art SL frameworks by significantly reducing communication
overheads while maintaining high accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.15058v1,,False
Balancing Sparse RNNs with Hyperparameterization Benefiting Meta-Learning,18/09/2025,"Quincy Hershey, Randy Paffenroth","This paper develops alternative hyperparameters for specifying sparse

sparsity within the trainable weight matrices of the model while improving
overall performance. This architecture enables the definition of a novel
metric, hidden proportion, which seeks to balance the distribution of unknowns
within the model and provides significant explanatory power of model
performance. Together, the use of the varied sparsity RNN architecture combined
with the hidden proportion metric generates significant performance gains while
improving performance expectations on an a priori basis. This combined approach
provides a path forward towards generalized meta-learning applications and

From Patterns to Predictions: A Shapelet-Based Framework for Directional Forecasting in Noisy Financial Markets,18/09/2025,"Juwon Kim, Hyunwook Lee, Hyotaek Jeon, Seungmin Jin, Sungahn Ko","Directional forecasting in financial markets requires both accuracy and
interpretability. Before the advent of deep learning, interpretable approaches
based on human-defined patterns were prevalent, but their structural vagueness
and scale ambiguity hindered generalization. In contrast, deep learning models
can effectively capture complex dynamics, yet often offer limited transparency.
To bridge this gap, we propose a two-stage framework that integrates
unsupervised pattern extracion with interpretable forecasting. (i) SIMPC
segments and clusters multivariate time series, extracting recurrent patterns
that are invariant to amplitude scaling and temporal distortion, even under
varying window sizes. (ii) JISC-Net is a shapelet-based classifier that uses
the initial part of extracted patterns as input and forecasts subsequent
partial sequences for short-term directional movement. Experiments on Bitcoin
and three S&P 500 equities demonstrate that our method ranks first or second in

Beyond Marginals: Learning Joint Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Multivariate Anomaly Detection,18/09/2025,"Padmaksha Roy, Almuatazbellah Boker, Lamine Mili","In this paper, we aim to improve multivariate anomaly detection (AD) by
modeling the \textit{time-varying non-linear spatio-temporal correlations}
found in multivariate time series data . In multivariate time series data, an
anomaly may be indicated by the simultaneous deviation of interrelated time
series from their expected collective behavior, even when no individual time
series exhibits a clearly abnormal pattern on its own. In many existing
approaches, time series variables are assumed to be (conditionally)
independent, which oversimplifies real-world interactions. Our approach
addresses this by modeling joint dependencies in the latent space and
decoupling the modeling of \textit{marginal distributions, temporal dynamics,
and inter-variable dependencies}. We use a transformer encoder to capture
temporal patterns, and to model spatial (inter-variable) dependencies, we fit a
multi-variate likelihood and a copula. The temporal and the spatial components

M4Diffuser: Multi-View Diffusion Policy with Manipulability-Aware Control for Robust Mobile Manipulation,18/09/2025,"Ju Dong, Lei Zhang, Liding Zhang, Yao Ling, Yu Fu, Kaixin Bai, Zoltán-Csaba Márton, Zhenshan Bing, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Christian Knoll, Jianwei Zhang","Mobile manipulation requires the coordinated control of a mobile base and a
robotic arm while simultaneously perceiving both global scene context and
fine-grained object details. Existing single-view approaches often fail in
unstructured environments due to limited fields of view, exploration, and
generalization abilities. Moreover, classical controllers, although stable,
struggle with efficiency and manipulability near singularities. To address
these challenges, we propose M4Diffuser, a hybrid framework that integrates a
Multi-View Diffusion Policy with a novel Reduced and Manipulability-aware QP
(ReM-QP) controller for mobile manipulation. The diffusion policy leverages
proprioceptive states and complementary camera perspectives with both
close-range object details and global scene context to generate task-relevant
end-effector goals in the world frame. These high-level goals are then executed
by the ReM-QP controller, which eliminates slack variables for computational
efficiency and incorporates manipulability-aware preferences for robustness
near singularities. Comprehensive experiments in simulation and real-world
environments show that M4Diffuser achieves 7 to 56 percent higher success rates
and reduces collisions by 3 to 31 percent over baselines. Our approach
demonstrates robust performance for smooth whole-body coordination, and strong
generalization to unseen tasks, paving the way for reliable mobile manipulation

Towards universal property prediction in Cartesian space: TACE is all you need,18/09/2025,"Zemin Xu, Wenbo Xie, Daiqian Xie, P. Hu","Machine learning has revolutionized atomistic simulations and materials
science, yet current approaches often depend on spherical-harmonic
representations. Here we introduce the Tensor Atomic Cluster Expansion and
Tensor Moment Potential, the first unified framework formulated entirely in
Cartesian space for the systematic prediction of arbitrary structure-determined
tensorial properties. TACE achieves this by decomposing atomic environments
into a complete hierarchy of (irreducible) Cartesian tensors, ensuring
symmetry-consistent representations that naturally encode invariance and
equivariance constraints. Beyond geometry, TACE incorporates universal
embeddings that flexibly integrate diverse attributes including basis sets,
charges, magnetic moments and field perturbations. This allows explicit control
over external invariants and equivariants in the prediction process. Long-range
interactions are also accurately described through the Latent Ewald Summation
module within the short-range approximation, providing a rigorous yet
computationally efficient treatment of electrostatic interactions. We
demonstrate that TACE attains accuracy, stability, and efficiency on par with
or surpassing leading equivariant frameworks across finite molecules and
extended materials, including in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks, spectra,
hessians, external-field response, charged systems, magnetic systems,
multi-fidelity training, and heterogeneous catalytic systems. Crucially, TACE
bridges scalar and tensorial modeling and establishes a Cartesian-space
paradigm that unifies and extends beyond the design space of
spherical-harmonic-based methods. This work lays the foundation for a new
generation of universal atomistic machine learning models capable of
systematically capturing the rich interplay of geometry, fields and material
properties within a single coherent framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14961v1,,False
Sentinel Agents for Secure and Trustworthy Agentic AI in Multi-Agent Systems,18/09/2025,"Diego Gosmar, Deborah A. Dahl","This paper proposes a novel architectural framework aimed at enhancing
security and reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS). A central component of
this framework is a network of Sentinel Agents, functioning as a distributed
security layer that integrates techniques such as semantic analysis via large
language models (LLMs), behavioral analytics, retrieval-augmented verification,
and cross-agent anomaly detection. Such agents can potentially oversee
inter-agent communications, identify potential threats, enforce privacy and
access controls, and maintain comprehensive audit records. Complementary to the
idea of Sentinel Agents is the use of a Coordinator Agent. The Coordinator
Agent supervises policy implementation, and manages agent participation. In
addition, the Coordinator also ingests alerts from Sentinel Agents. Based on
these alerts, it can adapt policies, isolate or quarantine misbehaving agents,
and contain threats to maintain the integrity of the MAS ecosystem. This
dual-layered security approach, combining the continuous monitoring of Sentinel
Agents with the governance functions of Coordinator Agents, supports dynamic
and adaptive defense mechanisms against a range of threats, including prompt
injection, collusive agent behavior, hallucinations generated by LLMs, privacy
breaches, and coordinated multi-agent attacks. In addition to the architectural
design, we present a simulation study where 162 synthetic attacks of different
families (prompt injection, hallucination, and data exfiltration) were injected
into a multi-agent conversational environment. The Sentinel Agents successfully
detected the attack attempts, confirming the practical feasibility of the
proposed monitoring approach. The framework also offers enhanced system
observability, supports regulatory compliance, and enables policy evolution

DAG: A Dual Causal Network for Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables,18/09/2025,"Xiangfei Qiu, Yuhan Zhu, Zhengyu Li, Hanyin Cheng, Xingjian Wu, Chenjuan Guo, Bin Yang, Jilin Hu","Time series forecasting is crucial in various fields such as economics,
traffic, and AIOps. However, in real-world applications, focusing solely on the
endogenous variables (i.e., target variables), is often insufficient to ensure
accurate predictions. Considering exogenous variables (i.e., covariates)
provides additional predictive information, thereby improving forecasting
accuracy. However, existing methods for time series forecasting with exogenous
variables (TSF-X) have the following shortcomings: 1) they do not leverage
future exogenous variables, 2) they fail to account for the causal
relationships between endogenous and exogenous variables. As a result, their
performance is suboptimal. In this study, to better leverage exogenous
variables, especially future exogenous variable, we propose a general framework
DAG, which utilizes dual causal network along both the temporal and channel
dimensions for time series forecasting with exogenous variables. Specifically,
we first introduce the Temporal Causal Module, which includes a causal
discovery module to capture how historical exogenous variables affect future
exogenous variables. Following this, we construct a causal injection module
that incorporates the discovered causal relationships into the process of
forecasting future endogenous variables based on historical endogenous
variables. Next, we propose the Channel Causal Module, which follows a similar
design principle. It features a causal discovery module models how historical
exogenous variables influence historical endogenous variables, and a causal
injection module incorporates the discovered relationships to enhance the
prediction of future endogenous variables based on future exogenous variables.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14933v1,,False
Inspired by machine learning optimization: can gradient-based optimizers solve cycle skipping in full waveform inversion given sufficient iterations?,18/09/2025,"Xinru Mu, Omar M. Saad, Shaowen Wang, Tariq Alkhalifah","Full waveform inversion (FWI) iteratively updates the velocity model by
minimizing the difference between observed and simulated data. Due to the high
computational cost and memory requirements associated with global optimization
algorithms, FWI is typically implemented using local optimization methods.
However, when the initial velocity model is inaccurate and low-frequency
seismic data (e.g., below 3 Hz) are absent, the mismatch between simulated and
observed data may exceed half a cycle, a phenomenon known as cycle skipping. In
such cases, local optimization algorithms (e.g., gradient-based local
optimizers) tend to converge to local minima, leading to inaccurate inversion
results. In machine learning, neural network training is also an optimization
problem prone to local minima. It often employs gradient-based optimizers with
a relatively large learning rate (beyond the theoretical limits of local
optimization that are usually determined numerically by a line search), which
allows the optimization to behave like a quasi-global optimizer. Consequently,
after training for several thousand iterations, we can obtain a neural network
model with strong generative capability. In this study, we also employ
gradient-based optimizers with a relatively large learning rate for FWI.
Results from both synthetic and field data experiments show that FWI may
initially converge to a local minimum; however, with sufficient additional
iterations, the inversion can gradually approach the global minimum, slowly
from shallow subsurface to deep, ultimately yielding an accurate velocity
model. Furthermore, numerical examples indicate that, given sufficient
iterations, reasonable velocity inversion results can still be achieved even
when low-frequency data below 5 Hz are missing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14919v1,,False
Beyond Spherical geometry: Unraveling complex features of objects orbiting around stars from its transit light curve using deep learning,18/09/2025,"Ushasi Bhowmick, Shivam Kumaran","Characterizing the geometry of an object orbiting around a star from its
transit light curve is a powerful tool to uncover various complex phenomena.
This problem is inherently ill-posed, since similar or identical light curves
can be produced by multiple different shapes. In this study, we investigate the
extent to which the features of a shape can be embedded in a transit light
curve. We generate a library of two-dimensional random shapes and simulate
their transit light curves with light curve simulator, Yuti. Each shape is
decomposed into a series of elliptical components expressed in the form of
Fourier coefficients that adds increasingly diminishing perturbations to an
ideal ellipse. We train deep neural networks to predict these Fourier
coefficients directly from simulated light curves. Our results demonstrate that
the neural network can successfully reconstruct the low-order ellipses, which
describe overall shape, orientation and large-scale perturbations. For higher
order ellipses the scale is successfully determined but the inference of
eccentricity and orientation is limited, demonstrating the extent of shape
information in the light curve. We explore the impact of non-convex shape
features in reconstruction, and show its dependence on shape orientation. The
level of reconstruction achieved by the neural network underscores the utility
of using light curves as a means to extract geometric information from
transiting systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14875v1,,False
Diffusion-Based Scenario Tree Generation for Multivariate Time Series Prediction and Multistage Stochastic Optimization,18/09/2025,"Stelios Zarifis, Ioannis Kordonis, Petros Maragos","Stochastic forecasting is critical for efficient decision-making in uncertain

Mitigating Intra-Speaker Variability in Diarization with Style-Controllable Speech Augmentation,18/09/2025,"Miseul Kim, Soo Jin Park, Kyungguen Byun, Hyeon-Kyeong Shin, Sunkuk Moon, Shuhua Zhang, Erik Visser","Speaker diarization systems often struggle with high intrinsic intra-speaker

enriched with phonetic and stylistic diversity. And then, speaker embeddings
from both the original and generated audio are blended to enhance the system's

Automating Modelica Module Generation Using Large Language Models: A Case Study on Building Control Description Language,18/09/2025,"Hanlong Wan, Xing Lu, Yan Chen, Karthik Devaprasad, Laura Hinkle","Dynamic energy systems and controls require advanced modeling frameworks to

Language modules in the Building Modelica Library as a case study. We developed
a structured workflow that combines standardized prompt scaffolds, library
aware grounding, automated compilation with OpenModelica, and human in the loop
evaluation. Experiments were carried out on four basic logic tasks (And, Or,
Not, and Switch) and five control modules (chiller enable/disable, bypass valve
control, cooling tower fan speed, plant requests, and relief damper control).
The results showed that GPT 4o failed to produce executable Modelica code in
zero shot mode, while Claude Sonnet 4 achieved up to full success for basic
logic blocks with carefully engineered prompts. For control modules, success
rates reached 83 percent, and failed outputs required medium level human repair
(estimated one to eight hours). Retrieval augmented generation often produced
mismatches in module selection (for example, And retrieved as Or), while a
deterministic hard rule search strategy avoided these errors. Human evaluation
also outperformed AI evaluation, since current LLMs cannot assess simulation
results or validate behavioral correctness. Despite these limitations, the LLM
assisted workflow reduced the average development time from 10 to 20 hours down

Rationality Check! Benchmarking the Rationality of Large Language Models,18/09/2025,"Zhilun Zhou, Jing Yi Wang, Nicholas Sukiennik, Chen Gao, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, James Evans","Large language models (LLMs), a recent advance in deep learning and machine
intelligence, have manifested astonishing capacities, now considered among the
most promising for artificial general intelligence. With human-like
capabilities, LLMs have been used to simulate humans and serve as AI assistants
across many applications. As a result, great concern has arisen about whether
and under what circumstances LLMs think and behave like real human agents.
Rationality is among the most important concepts in assessing human behavior,
both in thinking (i.e., theoretical rationality) and in taking action (i.e.,
practical rationality). In this work, we propose the first benchmark for
evaluating the omnibus rationality of LLMs, covering a wide range of domains
and LLMs. The benchmark includes an easy-to-use toolkit, extensive experimental
results, and analysis that illuminates where LLMs converge and diverge from
idealized human rationality. We believe the benchmark can serve as a
foundational tool for both developers and users of LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14546v1,,False
Predicting Case Suffixes With Activity Start and End Times: A Sweep-Line Based Approach,18/09/2025,"Muhammad Awais Ali, Marlon Dumas, Fredrik Milani","Predictive process monitoring techniques support the operational decision
making by predicting future states of ongoing cases of a business process. A
subset of these techniques predict the remaining sequence of activities of an
ongoing case (case suffix prediction). Existing approaches for case suffix
prediction generate sequences of activities with a single timestamp (e.g. the
end timestamp). This output is insufficient for resource capacity planning,
where we need to reason about the periods of time when resources will be busy
performing work. This paper introduces a technique for predicting case suffixes
consisting of activities with start and end timestamps. In other words, the
proposed technique predicts both the waiting time and the processing time of
each activity. Since the waiting time of an activity in a case depends on how
busy resources are in other cases, the technique adopts a sweep-line approach,
wherein the suffixes of all ongoing cases in the process are predicted in
lockstep, rather than predictions being made for each case in isolation. An
evaluation on real-life and synthetic datasets compares the accuracy of
different instantiations of this approach, demonstrating the advantages of a
multi-model approach to case suffix prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.14536v1,,False
