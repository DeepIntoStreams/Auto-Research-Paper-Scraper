Parallelly Tempered Generative Adversarial Networks,18/11/2024,"Jinwon Sohn, Qifan Song","A generative adversarial network (GAN) has been a representative backbone
model in generative artificial intelligence (AI) because of its powerful
performance in capturing intricate data-generating processes. However, the GAN
training is well-known for its notorious training instability, usually
characterized by the occurrence of mode collapse. Through the lens of
gradients' variance, this work particularly analyzes the training instability
and inefficiency in the presence of mode collapse by linking it to
multimodality in the target distribution. To ease the raised training issues
from severe multimodality, we introduce a novel GAN training framework that
leverages a series of tempered distributions produced via convex interpolation.
With our newly developed GAN objective function, the generator can learn all
the tempered distributions simultaneously, conceptually resonating with the
parallel tempering in Statistics. Our simulation studies demonstrate the
superiority of our approach over existing popular training strategies in both
image and tabular data synthesis. We theoretically analyze that such
significant improvement can arise from reducing the variance of gradient
estimates by using the tempered distributions. Finally, we further develop a
variant of the proposed framework aimed at generating fair synthetic data which
is one of the growing interests in the field of trustworthy AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11786v1,,False
Semantic-Geometric-Physical-Driven Robot Manipulation Skill Transfer via Skill Library and Tactile Representation,18/11/2024,"Mingchao Qi, Yuanjin Li, Xing Liu, Zhengxiong Liu, Panfeng Huang","Deploying robots in open-world environments involves complex tasks
characterized by long sequences and rich interactions, necessitating efficient
transfer of robotic skills across diverse and complex scenarios. To address
this challenge, we propose a skill library framework based on knowledge graphs,
which endows robots with high-level skill awareness and spatial semantic
understanding. The framework hierarchically organizes operational knowledge by
constructing a ""task graph"" and a ""scene graph"" to represent task and scene
semantic information, respectively. We introduce a ""state graph"" to facilitate
interaction between high-level task planning and low-level scene information.
Furthermore, we propose a hierarchical transfer framework for operational
skills. At the task level, the framework integrates contextual learning and
chain-of-thought prompting within a four-stage prompt paradigm, leveraging
large language models' (LLMs) reasoning and generalization capabilities to
achieve task-level subtask sequence transfer. At the motion level, an adaptive
trajectory transfer method is developed using the A* algorithm and the skill
library, enabling motion-level adaptive trajectory transfer. At the physical
level, we introduce an adaptive contour extraction and posture perception
method based on tactile perception. This method dynamically obtains
high-precision contour and posture information from visual-tactile texture data
and adjusts transferred skills, such as contact positions and postures, to
ensure effectiveness in new environments. Experimental results validate the
effectiveness of the proposed methods. Project

Robust Reinforcement Learning under Diffusion Models for Data with Jumps,18/11/2024,"Chenyang Jiang, Donggyu Kim, Alejandra Quintos, Yazhen Wang","Reinforcement Learning (RL) has proven effective in solving complex
decision-making tasks across various domains, but challenges remain in
continuous-time settings, particularly when state dynamics are governed by
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with jump components. In this paper,
we address this challenge by introducing the Mean-Square Bipower Variation
Error (MSBVE) algorithm, which enhances robustness and convergence in scenarios
involving significant stochastic noise and jumps. We first revisit the
Mean-Square TD Error (MSTDE) algorithm, commonly used in continuous-time RL,
and highlight its limitations in handling jumps in state dynamics. The proposed
MSBVE algorithm minimizes the mean-square quadratic variation error, offering
improved performance over MSTDE in environments characterized by SDEs with
jumps. Simulations and formal proofs demonstrate that the MSBVE algorithm
reliably estimates the value function in complex settings, surpassing MSTDE's
performance when faced with jump processes. These findings underscore the
importance of alternative error metrics to improve the resilience and
effectiveness of RL algorithms in continuous-time frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11697v1,,False
Artificial Scientific Discovery,18/11/2024,Antonio Norelli,"Rooted in the explosion of deep learning over the past decade, this thesis
spans from AlphaGo to ChatGPT to empirically examine the fundamental concepts
needed to realize the vision of an artificial scientist: a machine with the
capacity to autonomously generate original research and contribute to the
expansion of human knowledge. The investigation begins with {\sc Olivaw}, an
AlphaGo Zero-like agent that discovers Othello knowledge from scratch but is
unable to communicate it. This realization leads to the development of the
Explanatory Learning (EL) framework, a formalization of the problem faced by a
scientist when trying to explain a new phenomenon to their peers. The effective
EL prescriptions allow us to crack Zendo, a board game simulating the
scientific endeavor. This success comes with a fundamental insight: an
artificial scientist must develop its own interpretation of the language used
to explain its findings. This perspective then leads us to see modern
multimodal models as interpreters, and to devise a new way to build
interpretable and cost-effective CLIP-like models: by coupling two unimodal
models using little multimodal data and no further training. Finally, we
discuss what ChatGPT and its siblings are still missing to become artificial
scientists, and introduce Odeen, a benchmark about interpreting explanations
that sees LLMs going no further than random chance while being instead fully
solved by humans.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11672v1,,False
Generative Spatio-temporal GraphNet for Transonic Wing Pressure Distribution Forecasting,18/11/2024,"Gabriele Immordino, Andrea Vaiuso, Andrea Da Ronch, Marcello Righi","This study presents a framework for predicting unsteady transonic wing
pressure distributions, integrating an autoencoder architecture with graph
convolutional networks and graph-based temporal layers to model time
dependencies. The framework compresses high-dimensional pressure distribution
data into a lower-dimensional latent space using an autoencoder, ensuring
efficient data representation while preserving essential features. Within this
latent space, graph-based temporal layers are employed to predict future wing
pressures based on past data, effectively capturing temporal dependencies and
improving predictive accuracy. This combined approach leverages the strengths
of autoencoders for dimensionality reduction, graph convolutional networks for
handling unstructured grid data, and temporal layers for modeling time-based
sequences. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through its
application to the Benchmark Super Critical Wing test case, achieving accuracy
comparable to computational fluid dynamics, while significantly reducing
prediction time. This framework offers a scalable, computationally efficient
solution for the aerodynamic analysis of unsteady phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11592v1,,False
Hybrid Data-Driven SSM for Interpretable and Label-Free mmWave Channel Prediction,18/11/2024,"Yiyong Sun, Jiajun He, Zhidi Lin, Wenqiang Pu, Feng Yin, Hing Cheung So","Accurate prediction of mmWave time-varying channels is essential for
mitigating the issue of channel aging in complex scenarios owing to high user
mobility. Existing channel prediction methods have limitations: classical
model-based methods often struggle to track highly nonlinear channel dynamics
due to limited expert knowledge, while emerging data-driven methods typically
require substantial labeled data for effective training and often lack
interpretability. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel hybrid
method that integrates a data-driven neural network into a conventional
model-based workflow based on a state-space model (SSM), implicitly tracking
complex channel dynamics from data without requiring precise expert knowledge.
Additionally, a novel unsupervised learning strategy is developed to train the
embedded neural network solely with unlabeled data. Theoretical analyses and
ablation studies are conducted to interpret the enhanced benefits gained from
the hybrid integration. Numerical simulations based on the 3GPP mmWave channel
model corroborate the superior prediction accuracy of the proposed method,
compared to state-of-the-art methods that are either purely model-based or
data-driven. Furthermore, extensive experiments validate its robustness against
various challenging factors, including among others severe channel variations
and high noise levels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11576v1,,False
Real-Time Fitness Exercise Classification and Counting from Video Frames,18/11/2024,Riccardo Riccio,"This paper introduces a novel method for real-time exercise classification
using a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) neural network. Existing
exercise recognition approaches often rely on synthetic datasets, raw
coordinate inputs sensitive to user and camera variations, and fail to fully
exploit the temporal dependencies in exercise movements. These issues limit
their generalizability and robustness in real-world conditions, where lighting,
camera angles, and user body types vary.
  To address these challenges, we propose a BiLSTM-based model that leverages
invariant features, such as joint angles, alongside raw coordinates. By using
both angles and (x, y, z) coordinates, the model adapts to changes in
perspective, user positioning, and body differences, improving generalization.
Training on 30-frame sequences enables the BiLSTM to capture the temporal
context of exercises and recognize patterns evolving over time.
  We compiled a dataset combining synthetic data from the InfiniteRep dataset
and real-world videos from Kaggle and other sources. This dataset includes four
common exercises: squat, push-up, shoulder press, and bicep curl. The model was
trained and validated on these diverse datasets, achieving an accuracy of over
99% on the test set. To assess generalizability, the model was tested on 2
separate test sets representative of typical usage conditions. Comparisons with
the previous approach from the literature are present in the result section
showing that the proposed model is the best-performing one.
  The classifier is integrated into a web application providing real-time
exercise classification and repetition counting without manual exercise
selection.
  Demo and datasets are available at the following GitHub Repository:

Robust Bernoulli mixture models for credit portfolio risk,18/11/2024,"Jonathan Ansari, Eva Lütkebohmert","This paper presents comparison results and establishes risk bounds for credit
portfolios within classes of Bernoulli mixture models, assuming conditionally
independent defaults that are stochastically increasing with a common risk
factor. We provide simple and interpretable conditions for conditional default
probabilities that imply a comparison of credit portfolio losses in convex
order. In the case of threshold models, the ranking of portfolio losses is
based on a pointwise comparison of the underlying copulas. Our setting includes
as special case the well-known Gaussian copula model but allows for general
tail dependencies, which are crucial for modeling credit portfolio risks.
Moreover, our results extend the classical parameterized models, such as the
industry models CreditMetrics and KMV Portfolio Manager, to a robust setting
where individual parameters or the copula modeling the dependence structure can
be ambiguous. A simulation study and a real data example under model
uncertainty offer evidence supporting the effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11522v1,,False
A Modular Open Source Framework for Genomic Variant Calling,18/11/2024,"Ankita Vaishnobi Bisoi, Bharath Ramsundar","Variant calling is a fundamental task in genomic research, essential for
detecting genetic variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and
insertions or deletions (indels). This paper presents an enhancement to
DeepChem, a widely used open-source drug discovery framework, through the
integration of DeepVariant. In particular, we introduce a variant calling
pipeline that leverages DeepVariant's convolutional neural network (CNN)
architecture to improve the accuracy and reliability of variant detection. The
implemented pipeline includes stages for realignment of sequencing reads,
candidate variant detection, and pileup image generation, followed by variant
classification using a modified Inception v3 model. Our work adds a modular and
extensible variant calling framework to the DeepChem framework and enables
future work integrating DeepChem's drug discovery infrastructure more tightly
with bioinformatics pipelines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11513v1,,False
Physics Encoded Blocks in Residual Neural Network Architectures for Digital Twin Models,18/11/2024,"Muhammad Saad Zia, Ashiq Anjum, Lu Liu, Anthony Conway, Anasol Pena Rios","Physics Informed Machine Learning has emerged as a popular approach in
modelling and simulation for digital twins to generate accurate models of
processes and behaviours of real-world systems. However, despite their success
in generating accurate and reliable models, the existing methods either use
simple regularizations in loss functions to offer limited physics integration
or are too specific in architectural definitions to be generalized to a wide
variety of physical systems. This paper presents a generic approach based on a
novel physics-encoded residual neural network architecture to combine
data-driven and physics-based analytical models to address these limitations.
Our method combines physics blocks as mathematical operators from physics-based
models with learning blocks comprising feed-forward layers. Intermediate
residual blocks are incorporated for stable gradient flow as they train on
physical system observation data. This way, the model learns to comply with the
geometric and kinematic aspects of the physical system. Compared to
conventional neural network-based methods, our method improves generalizability
with substantially low data requirements and model complexity in terms of
parameters, especially in scenarios where prior physics knowledge is either
elementary or incomplete. We investigate our approach in two application
domains. The first is a basic robotic motion model using Euler Lagrangian
equations of motion as physics prior. The second application is a complex
scenario of a steering model for a self-driving vehicle in a simulation. In
both applications, our method outperforms both conventional neural network
based approaches as-well as state-of-the-art Physics Informed Machine Learning
methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11497v1,,False
Physics meets Topology: Physics-informed topological neural networks for learning rigid body dynamics,18/11/2024,"Amaury Wei, Olga Fink","Rigid body interactions are fundamental to numerous scientific disciplines,
but remain challenging to simulate due to their abrupt nonlinear nature and
sensitivity to complex, often unknown environmental factors. These challenges
call for adaptable learning-based methods capable of capturing complex
interactions beyond explicit physical models and simulations. While graph
neural networks can handle simple scenarios, they struggle with complex scenes
and long-term predictions. We introduce a novel framework for modeling rigid
body dynamics and learning collision interactions, addressing key limitations
of existing graph-based methods. Our approach extends the traditional
representation of meshes by incorporating higher-order topology complexes,
offering a physically consistent representation. Additionally, we propose a
physics-informed message-passing neural architecture, embedding physical laws
directly in the model. Our method demonstrates superior accuracy, even during
long rollouts, and exhibits strong generalization to unseen scenarios.
Importantly, this work addresses the challenge of multi-entity dynamic
interactions, with applications spanning diverse scientific and engineering
domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11467v1,,False
IKEA Manuals at Work: 4D Grounding of Assembly Instructions on Internet Videos,18/11/2024,"Yunong Liu, Cristobal Eyzaguirre, Manling Li, Shubh Khanna, Juan Carlos Niebles, Vineeth Ravi, Saumitra Mishra, Weiyu Liu, Jiajun Wu","Shape assembly is a ubiquitous task in daily life, integral for constructing
complex 3D structures like IKEA furniture. While significant progress has been
made in developing autonomous agents for shape assembly, existing datasets have
not yet tackled the 4D grounding of assembly instructions in videos, essential
for a holistic understanding of assembly in 3D space over time. We introduce
IKEA Video Manuals, a dataset that features 3D models of furniture parts,
instructional manuals, assembly videos from the Internet, and most importantly,
annotations of dense spatio-temporal alignments between these data modalities.
To demonstrate the utility of IKEA Video Manuals, we present five applications
essential for shape assembly: assembly plan generation, part-conditioned

furniture assembly based on instructional video manuals. For each application,
we provide evaluation metrics and baseline methods. Through experiments on our

Zero-Shot Load Forecasting with Large Language Models,18/11/2024,"Wenlong Liao, Zhe Yang, Mengshuo Jia, Christian Rehtanz, Jiannong Fang, Fernando Porté-Agel","Deep learning models have shown strong performance in load forecasting, but
they generally require large amounts of data for model training before being
applied to new scenarios, which limits their effectiveness in data-scarce
scenarios. Inspired by the great success of pre-trained language models (LLMs)
in natural language processing, this paper proposes a zero-shot load
forecasting approach using an advanced LLM framework denoted as the Chronos
model. By utilizing its extensive pre-trained knowledge, the Chronos model
enables accurate load forecasting in data-scarce scenarios without the need for
extensive data-specific training. Simulation results across five real-world
datasets demonstrate that the Chronos model significantly outperforms nine
popular baseline models for both deterministic and probabilistic load
forecasting with various forecast horizons (e.g., 1 to 48 hours), even though
the Chronos model is neither tailored nor fine-tuned to these specific load
datasets. Notably, Chronos reduces root mean squared error (RMSE), continuous
ranked probability score (CRPS), and quantile score (QS) by approximately
7.34%-84.30%, 19.63%-60.06%, and 22.83%-54.49%, respectively, compared to
baseline models. These results highlight the superiority and flexibility of the
Chronos model, positioning it as an effective solution in data-scarce
scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11350v1,,False
Mitigating Knowledge Conflicts in Language Model-Driven Question Answering,18/11/2024,"Han Cao, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xiangtian Li, Chufan Wu, Hansong Zhang, Wenqing Zhang","Knowledge-aware sequence to sequence generation tasks such as document
question answering and abstract summarization typically requires two types of
knowledge: encoded parametric knowledge and retrieved contextual information.
Previous work show improper correlation between parametric knowledge and
answers in the training set could cause the model ignore input information at
test time, resulting in un-desirable model behaviour such as over-stability and
hallucination. In this work, we argue that hallucination could be mitigated via
explicit correlation between input source and generated content. We focus on a
typical example of hallucination, entity-based knowledge conflicts in question
answering, where correlation of entities and their description at training time
hinders model behaviour during inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11344v1,,False
Enhancing Decision Transformer with Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation,18/11/2024,"Zhihong Liu, Long Qian, Zeyang Liu, Lipeng Wan, Xingyu Chen, Xuguang Lan","Decision Transformer (DT) can learn effective policy from offline datasets by
converting the offline reinforcement learning (RL) into a supervised sequence
modeling task, where the trajectory elements are generated auto-regressively
conditioned on the return-to-go (RTG).However, the sequence modeling learning
approach tends to learn policies that converge on the sub-optimal trajectories
within the dataset, for lack of bridging data to move to better trajectories,
even if the condition is set to the highest RTG.To address this issue, we
introduce Diffusion-Based Trajectory Branch Generation (BG), which expands the
trajectories of the dataset with branches generated by a diffusion model.The
trajectory branch is generated based on the segment of the trajectory within
the dataset, and leads to trajectories with higher returns.We concatenate the
generated branch with the trajectory segment as an expansion of the
trajectory.After expanding, DT has more opportunities to learn policies to move
to better trajectories, preventing it from converging to the sub-optimal
trajectories.Empirically, after processing with BG, DT outperforms
state-of-the-art sequence modeling methods on D4RL benchmark, demonstrating the
effectiveness of adding branches to the dataset without further modifications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11327v1,,False
Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks with Incremental Blocks,18/11/2024,"Gang Dang, Dainhui Wang","Recurrent stochastic configuration networks (RSCNs) have shown promise in
modelling nonlinear dynamic systems with order uncertainty due to their
advantages of easy implementation, less human intervention, and strong
approximation capability. This paper develops the original RSCNs with block
increments, termed block RSCNs (BRSCNs), to further enhance the learning
capacity and efficiency of the network. BRSCNs can simultaneously add multiple
reservoir nodes (subreservoirs) during the construction. Each subreservoir is
configured with a unique structure in the light of a supervisory mechanism,
ensuring the universal approximation property. The reservoir feedback matrix is
appropriately scaled to guarantee the echo state property of the network.
Furthermore, the output weights are updated online using a projection
algorithm, and the persistent excitation conditions that facilitate parameter
convergence are also established. Numerical results over a time series
prediction, a nonlinear system identification task, and two industrial data
predictive analyses demonstrate that the proposed BRSCN performs favourably in
terms of modelling efficiency, learning, and generalization performance,

GROOT: Effective Design of Biological Sequences with Limited Experimental Data,18/11/2024,"Thanh V. T. Tran, Nhat Khang Ngo, Viet Anh Nguyen, Truong Son Hy","Latent space optimization (LSO) is a powerful method for designing discrete,
high-dimensional biological sequences that maximize expensive black-box
functions, such as wet lab experiments. This is accomplished by learning a
latent space from available data and using a surrogate model to guide
optimization algorithms toward optimal outputs. However, existing methods
struggle when labeled data is limited, as training the surrogate model with few
labeled data points can lead to subpar outputs, offering no advantage over the
training data itself. We address this challenge by introducing GROOT, a
Graph-based Latent Smoothing for Biological Sequence Optimization. In
particular, GROOT generates pseudo-labels for neighbors sampled around the
training latent embeddings. These pseudo-labels are then refined and smoothed
by Label Propagation. Additionally, we theoretically and empirically justify
our approach, demonstrate GROOT's ability to extrapolate to regions beyond the
training set while maintaining reliability within an upper bound of their
expected distances from the training regions. We evaluate GROOT on various
biological sequence design tasks, including protein optimization (GFP and AAV)
and three tasks with exact oracles from Design-Bench. The results demonstrate
that GROOT equalizes and surpasses existing methods without requiring access to
black-box oracles or vast amounts of labeled data, highlighting its

EXCON: Extreme Instance-based Contrastive Representation Learning of Severely Imbalanced Multivariate Time Series for Solar Flare Prediction,18/11/2024,"Onur Vural, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi","In heliophysics research, predicting solar flares is crucial due to their
potential to impact both space-based systems and Earth's infrastructure
substantially. Magnetic field data from solar active regions, recorded by solar
imaging observatories, are transformed into multivariate time series to enable
solar flare prediction using temporal window-based analysis. In the realm of
multivariate time series-driven solar flare prediction, addressing severe class
imbalance with effective strategies for multivariate time series representation
learning is key to developing robust predictive models. Traditional methods
often struggle with overfitting to the majority class in prediction tasks where
major solar flares are infrequent. This work presents EXCON, a contrastive
representation learning framework designed to enhance classification
performance amidst such imbalances. EXCON operates through four stages:
obtaining core features from multivariate time series data; selecting
distinctive contrastive representations for each class to maximize inter-class
separation; training a temporal feature embedding module with a custom extreme
reconstruction loss to minimize intra-class variation; and applying a
classifier to the learned embeddings for robust classification. The proposed
method leverages contrastive learning principles to map similar instances
closer in the feature space while distancing dissimilar ones, a strategy not
extensively explored in solar flare prediction tasks. This approach not only
addresses class imbalance but also offers a versatile solution applicable to
univariate and multivariate time series across binary and multiclass
classification problems. Experimental results, including evaluations on the
benchmark solar flare dataset and multiple time series archive datasets with
binary and multiclass labels, demonstrate EXCON's efficacy in enhancing
classification performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.11249v1,,False
