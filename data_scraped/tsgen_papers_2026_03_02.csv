Memory Caching: RNNs with Growing Memory,27/02/2026,"Ali Behrouz, Zeman Li, Yuan Deng, Peilin Zhong, Meisam Razaviyayn, Vahab Mirrokni","Transformers have been established as the de-facto backbones for most recent advances in sequence modeling, mainly due to their growing memory capacity that scales with the context length. While plausible for retrieval tasks, it causes quadratic complexity and so has motivated recent studies to explore viable subquadratic recurrent alternatives. Despite showing promising preliminary results in diverse domains, such recurrent architectures underperform Transformers in recall-intensive tasks, often attributed to their fixed-size memory. In this paper, we introduce Memory Caching (MC), a simple yet effective technique that enhances recurrent models by caching checkpoints of their memory states (a.k.a. hidden states). Memory Caching allows the effective memory capacity of RNNs to grow with sequence length, offering a flexible trade-off that interpolates between the fixed memory (i.e., $O(L)$ complexity) of RNNs and the growing memory (i.e., $O(L^2)$ complexity) of Transformers. We propose four variants of MC, including gated aggregation and sparse selective mechanisms, and discuss their implications on both linear and deep memory modules. Our experimental results on language modeling, and long-context understanding tasks show that MC enhances the performance of recurrent models, supporting its effectiveness. The results of in-context recall tasks indicate that while Transformers achieve the best accuracy, our MC variants show competitive performance, close the gap with Transformers, and performs better than state-of-the-art recurrent models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24281v1,,False
FaultXformer: A Transformer-Encoder Based Fault Classification and Location Identification model in PMU-Integrated Active Electrical Distribution System,27/02/2026,"Kriti Thakur, Alivelu Manga Parimi, Mayukha Pal","Accurate fault detection and localization in electrical distribution systems is crucial, especially with the increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs), which inject greater variability and complexity into grid operations. In this study, FaultXformer is proposed, a Transformer encoder-based architecture developed for automatic fault analysis using real-time current data obtained from phasor measurement unit (PMU). The approach utilizes time-series current data to initially extract rich temporal information in stage 1, which is crucial for identifying the fault type and precisely determining its location across multiple nodes. In Stage 2, these extracted features are processed to differentiate among distinct fault types and identify the respective fault location within the distribution system. Thus, this dual-stage transformer encoder pipeline enables high-fidelity representation learning, considerably boosting the performance of the work. The model was validated on a dataset generated from the IEEE 13-node test feeder, simulated with 20 separate fault locations and several DER integration scenarios, utilizing current measurements from four strategically located PMUs. To demonstrate robust performance evaluation, stratified 10-fold cross-validation is performed. FaultXformer achieved average accuracies of 98.76% in fault type classification and 98.92% in fault location identification across cross-validation, consistently surpassing conventional deep learning baselines convolutional neural network (CNN), recurrent neural network (RNN). long short-term memory (LSTM) by 1.70%, 34.95%, and 2.04% in classification accuracy and by 10.82%, 40.89%, and 6.27% in location accuracy, respectively. These results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed model with significant DER penetration.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24254v1,,False
Time Series Foundation Models as Strong Baselines in Transportation Forecasting: A Large-Scale Benchmark Analysis,27/02/2026,"Javier Pulido, Filipe Rodrigues","Accurate forecasting of transportation dynamics is essential for urban mobility and infrastructure planning. Although recent work has achieved strong performance with deep learning models, these methods typically require dataset-specific training, architecture design and hyper-parameter tuning. This paper evaluates whether general-purpose time-series foundation models can serve as forecasters for transportation tasks by benchmarking the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art model, Chronos-2, across ten real-world datasets covering highway traffic volume and flow, urban traffic speed, bike-sharing demand, and electric vehicle charging station data. Under a consistent evaluation protocol, we find that, even without any task-specific fine-tuning, Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art or competitive accuracy across most datasets, frequently outperforming classical statistical baselines and specialized deep learning architectures, particularly at longer horizons. Beyond point forecasting, we evaluate its native probabilistic outputs using prediction-interval coverage and sharpness, demonstrating that Chronos-2 also provides useful uncertainty quantification without dataset-specific training. In general, this study supports the adoption of time-series foundation models as a key baseline for transportation forecasting research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24238v1,,False
Flow-Based Density Ratio Estimation for Intractable Distributions with Applications in Genomics,27/02/2026,"Egor Antipov, Alessandro Palma, Lorenzo Consoli, Stephan Günnemann, Andrea Dittadi, Fabian J. Theis","Estimating density ratios between pairs of intractable data distributions is a core problem in probabilistic modeling, enabling principled comparisons of sample likelihoods under different data-generating processes across conditions and covariates. While exact-likelihood models such as normalizing flows offer a promising approach to density ratio estimation, naive flow-based evaluations are computationally expensive, as they require simulating costly likelihood integrals for each distribution separately. In this work, we leverage condition-aware flow matching to derive a single dynamical formulation for tracking density ratios along generative trajectories. We demonstrate competitive performance on simulated benchmarks for closed-form ratio estimation, and show that our method supports versatile tasks in single-cell genomics data analysis, where likelihood-based comparisons of cellular states across experimental conditions enable treatment effect estimation and batch correction evaluation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24201v1,,False
Task-Centric Acceleration of Small-Language Models,27/02/2026,"Dor Tsur, Sharon Adar, Ran Levy","Small language models (SLMs) have emerged as efficient alternatives to large language models for task-specific applications. However, they are often employed in high-volume, low-latency settings, where efficiency is crucial. We propose TASC, Task-Adaptive Sequence Compression, a framework for SLM acceleration comprising two use-cases: When performing SLM fine-tuning, we propose TASC-ft, which iteratively enriches the tokenizer vocabulary with high-frequency output n-grams and then fine-tunes the model to utilize the expanded vocabulary. Next, we propose an inference-time method, termed TASC-spec. TASC-spec is a lightweight, training-free speculative decoding method that constructs an n-gram draft model from the task's output corpus, mixing task and context n-gram information.TASC-spec avoids any additional training, while bypassing draft-target vocabulary alignment constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of both methods across multiple low output-variability generation tasks. Our methods show consistent improvements in inference efficiency while maintaining task performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24174v1,,False
What You Read is What You Classify: Highlighting Attributions to Text and Text-Like Inputs,27/02/2026,"Daniel S. Berman, Brian Merritt, Stanley Ta, Dana Udwin, Amanda Ernlund, Jeremy Ratcliff, Vijay Narayan","At present, there are no easily understood explainable artificial intelligence (AI) methods for discrete token inputs, like text. Most explainable AI techniques do not extend well to token sequences, where both local and global features matter, because state-of-the-art models, like transformers, tend to focus on global connections. Therefore, existing explainable AI algorithms fail by (i) identifying disparate tokens of importance, or (ii) assigning a large number of tokens a low value of importance. This method for explainable AI for tokens-based classifiers generalizes a mask-based explainable AI algorithm for images. It starts with an Explainer neural network that is trained to create masks to hide information not relevant for classification. Then, the Hadamard product of the mask and the continuous values of the classifier's embedding layer is taken and passed through the classifier, changing the magnitude of the embedding vector but keeping the orientation unchanged. The Explainer is trained for a taxonomic classifier for nucleotide sequences and it is shown that the masked segments are less relevant to classification than the unmasked ones. This method focused on the importance the token as a whole (i.e., a segment of the input sequence), producing a human-readable explanation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24149v1,,False
End-to-end Differentiable Calibration and Reconstruction for Optical Particle Detectors,27/02/2026,"Omar Alterkait, César Jesús-Valls, Ryo Matsumoto, Patrick de Perio, Kazuhiro Terao","Large-scale homogeneous detectors with optical readouts are widely used in particle detection, with Cherenkov and scintillator neutrino detectors as prominent examples. Analyses in experimental physics rely on high-fidelity simulators to translate sensor-level information into physical quantities of interest. This task critically depends on accurate calibration, which aligns simulation behavior with real detector data, and on tracking, which infers particle properties from optical signals. We present the first end-to-end differentiable optical particle detector simulator, enabling simultaneous calibration and reconstruction through gradient-based optimization. Our approach unifies simulation, calibration, and tracking, which are traditionally treated as separate problems, within a single differentiable framework. We demonstrate that it achieves smooth and physically meaningful gradients across all key stages of light generation, propagation, and detection while maintaining computational efficiency. We show that gradient-based calibration and reconstruction greatly simplify existing analysis pipelines while matching or surpassing the performance of conventional non-differentiable methods in both accuracy and speed. Moreover, the framework's modularity allows straightforward adaptation to diverse detector geometries and target materials, providing a flexible foundation for experiment design and optimization. The results demonstrate the readiness of this technique for adoption in current and future optical detector experiments, establishing a new paradigm for simulation and reconstruction in particle physics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24129v1,,False
DiffusionHarmonizer: Bridging Neural Reconstruction and Photorealistic Simulation with Online Diffusion Enhancer,27/02/2026,"Yuxuan Zhang, Katarína Tóthová, Zian Wang, Kangxue Yin, Haithem Turki, Riccardo de Lutio, Yen-Yu Chang, Or Litany, Sanja Fidler, Zan Gojcic","Simulation is essential to the development and evaluation of autonomous robots such as self-driving vehicles. Neural reconstruction is emerging as a promising solution as it enables simulating a wide variety of scenarios from real-world data alone in an automated and scalable way. However, while methods such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting can produce visually compelling results, they often exhibit artifacts particularly when rendering novel views, and fail to realistically integrate inserted dynamic objects, especially when they were captured from different scenes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce DiffusionHarmonizer, an online generative enhancement framework that transforms renderings from such imperfect scenes into temporally consistent outputs while improving their realism. At its core is a single-step temporally-conditioned enhancer that is converted from a pretrained multi-step image diffusion model, capable of running in online simulators on a single GPU. The key to training it effectively is a custom data curation pipeline that constructs synthetic-real pairs emphasizing appearance harmonization, artifact correction, and lighting realism. The result is a scalable system that significantly elevates simulation fidelity in both research and production environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24096v1,,False
Neural Diffusion Intensity Models for Point Process Data,27/02/2026,"Xinlong Du, Harsha Honnappa, Vinayak Rao","Cox processes model overdispersed point process data via a latent stochastic intensity, but both nonparametric estimation of the intensity model and posterior inference over intensity paths are typically intractable, relying on expensive MCMC methods. We introduce Neural Diffusion Intensity Models, a variational framework for Cox processes driven by neural SDEs. Our key theoretical result, based on enlargement of filtrations, shows that conditioning on point process observations preserves the diffusion structure of the latent intensity with an explicit drift correction. This guarantees the variational family contains the true posterior, so that ELBO maximization coincides with maximum likelihood estimation under sufficient model capacity. We design an amortized encoder architecture that maps variable-length event sequences to posterior intensity paths by simulating the drift-corrected SDE, replacing repeated MCMC runs with a single forward pass. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data demonstrate accurate recovery of latent intensity dynamics and posterior paths, with orders-of-magnitude speedups over MCMC-based methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.24083v1,,False
PointCoT: A Multi-modal Benchmark for Explicit 3D Geometric Reasoning,27/02/2026,"Dongxu Zhang, Yiding Sun, Pengcheng Li, Yumou Liu, Hongqiang Lin, Haoran Xu, Xiaoxuan Mu, Liang Lin, Wenbiao Yan, Ning Yang, Chaowei Fang, Juanjuan Zhao, Jihua Zhu, Conghui He, Cheng Tan","While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate proficiency in 2D scenes, extending their perceptual intelligence to 3D point cloud understanding remains a significant challenge. Current approaches focus primarily on aligning 3D features with pre-trained models. However, they typically treat geometric reasoning as an implicit mapping process. These methods bypass intermediate logical steps and consequently suffer from geometric hallucinations. They confidently generate plausible responses that fail to ground in precise structural details. To bridge this gap, we present PointCoT, a novel framework that empowers MLLMs with explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning for 3D data. We advocate for a \textit{Look, Think, then Answer} paradigm. In this approach, the model is supervised to generate geometry-grounded rationales before predicting final answers. To facilitate this, we construct Point-Reason-Instruct, a large-scale benchmark comprising $\sim$86k instruction-tuning samples with hierarchical CoT annotations. By leveraging a dual-stream multi-modal architecture, our method synergizes semantic appearance with geometric truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PointCoT achieves state-of-the-art performance on complex reasoning tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23945v1,,False
A Theory of Random Graph Shift in Truncated-Spectrum vRKHS,27/02/2026,"Zhang Wan, Tingting Mu, Samuel Kaski","This paper develops a theory of graph classification under domain shift through a random-graph generative lens, where we consider intra-class graphs sharing the same random graph model (RGM) and the domain shift induced by changes in RGM components. While classic domain adaptation (DA) theories have well-underpinned existing techniques to handle graph distribution shift, the information of graph samples, which are itself structured objects, is less explored. The non-Euclidean nature of graphs and specialized architectures for graph learning further complicate a fine-grained analysis of graph distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose a theory that assumes RGM as the data generative process, exploiting its connection to hypothesis complexity in function space perspective for such fine-grained analysis. Building on a vector-valued reproducing kernel Hilbert space (vRKHS) formulation, we derive a generalization bound whose shift penalty admits a factorization into (i) a domain discrepancy term, (ii) a spectral-geometry term summarized by the accessible truncated spectrum, and (iii) an amplitude term that aggregates convergence and construction-stability effects. We empirically verify the insights on these terms in both real data and simulations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23880v1,,False
TradeFM: A Generative Foundation Model for Trade-flow and Market Microstructure,27/02/2026,"Maxime Kawawa-Beaudan, Srijan Sood, Kassiani Papasotiriou, Daniel Borrajo, Manuela Veloso","Foundation models have transformed domains from language to genomics by learning general-purpose representations from large-scale, heterogeneous data. We introduce TradeFM, a 524M-parameter generative Transformer that brings this paradigm to market microstructure, learning directly from billions of trade events across >9K equities. To enable cross-asset generalization, we develop scale-invariant features and a universal tokenization scheme that map the heterogeneous, multi-modal event stream of order flow into a unified discrete sequence -- eliminating asset-specific calibration. Integrated with a deterministic market simulator, TradeFM-generated rollouts reproduce key stylized facts of financial returns, including heavy tails, volatility clustering, and absence of return autocorrelation. Quantitatively, TradeFM achieves 2-3x lower distributional error than Compound Hawkes baselines and generalizes zero-shot to geographically out-of-distribution APAC markets with moderate perplexity degradation. Together, these results suggest that scale-invariant trade representations capture transferable structure in market microstructure, opening a path toward synthetic data generation, stress testing, and learning-based trading agents.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23784v1,,False
Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization,27/02/2026,"Zhipeng Xu, Zilong Wang, Xinyang Jiang, Dongsheng Li, De Cheng, Nannan Wang","This paper addresses the domain generalization (DG) problem in deep learning. While most DG methods focus on enforcing visual feature invariance, we leverage the reasoning capability of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and explore the potential of constructing reasoning chains that derives image categories to achieve more robust predictions under domain shift. To this end, we systematically study the role of reasoning in DG using DomainBed-Reasoning, a newly constructed extension of DomainBed dataset, in which each sample is paired with class-relevant reasoning chains. Our analysis reveals two key challenges: (i) fine-tuning MLLMs with reasoning chains for classification is more challenging than direct label supervision, since the model must optimize complex reasoning sequences before label prediction; and (ii) mismatches in reasoning patterns between supervision signals and fine-tuned MLLMs lead to a trade-off between semantic richness (informative but harder to optimize) and optimization efficiency (easier to optimize but less informative). To address these issues, we propose RD-MLDG (Reasoning-Driven Multimodal LLM for Domain Generalization), a framework with two components: (i) MTCT (Multi-Task Cross-Training), which introduces an additional direct classification pathway to guide reasoning supervision; and (ii) SARR (Self-Aligned Reasoning Regularization), which preserves the semantic richness of reasoning chains while mitigating reasoning-pattern mismatches via iterative self-labeling. Experiments on standard DomainBed datasets (PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome, TerraInc) demonstrate that RD-MLDG achieves state-of-the-art performances, highlighting reasoning as a promising complementary signal for robust out-of-domain generalization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23777v1,,False
Selective Denoising Diffusion Model for Time Series Anomaly Detection,27/02/2026,"Kohei Obata, Zheng Chen, Yasuko Matsubara, Lingwei Zhu, Yasushi Sakurai","Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) has been an important area of research for decades, with reconstruction-based methods, mostly based on generative models, gaining popularity and demonstrating success. Diffusion models have recently attracted attention due to their advanced generative capabilities. Existing diffusion-based methods for TSAD rely on a conditional strategy, which reconstructs input instances from white noise with the aid of the conditioner. However, this poses challenges in accurately reconstructing the normal parts, resulting in suboptimal detection performance. In response, we propose a novel diffusion-based method, named AnomalyFilter, which acts as a selective filter that only denoises anomaly parts in the instance while retaining normal parts. To build such a filter, we mask Gaussian noise during the training phase and conduct the denoising process without adding noise to the instances. The synergy of the two simple components greatly enhances the performance of naive diffusion models. Extensive experiments on five datasets demonstrate that AnomalyFilter achieves notably low reconstruction error on normal parts, providing empirical support for its effectiveness in anomaly detection. AnomalyFilter represents a pioneering approach that focuses on the noise design of diffusion models specifically tailored for TSAD.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23662v1,,False
TRIZ-RAGNER: A Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Model for TRIZ-Aware Named Entity Recognition in Patent-Based Contradiction Mining,27/02/2026,"Zitong Xu, Yuqing Wu, Yue Zhao","TRIZ-based contradiction mining is a fundamental task in patent analysis and systematic innovation, as it enables the identification of improving and worsening technical parameters that drive inventive problem solving. However, existing approaches largely rely on rule-based systems or traditional machine learning models, which struggle with semantic ambiguity, domain dependency, and limited generalization when processing complex patent language. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown strong semantic understanding capabilities, yet their direct application to TRIZ parameter extraction remains challenging due to hallucination and insufficient grounding in structured TRIZ knowledge. To address these limitations, this paper proposes TRIZ-RAGNER, a retrieval-augmented large language model framework for TRIZ-aware named entity recognition in patent-based contradiction mining. TRIZ-RAGNER reformulates contradiction mining as a semantic-level NER task and integrates dense retrieval over a TRIZ knowledge base, cross-encoder reranking for context refinement, and structured LLM prompting to extract improving and worsening parameters from patent sentences. By injecting domain-specific TRIZ knowledge into the LLM reasoning process, the proposed framework effectively reduces semantic noise and improves extraction consistency. Experiments on the PaTRIZ dataset demonstrate that TRIZ-RAGNER consistently outperforms traditional sequence labeling models and LLM-based baselines. The proposed framework achieves a precision of 85.6%, a recall of 82.9%, and an F1-score of 84.2% in TRIZ contradiction pair identification. Compared with the strongest baseline using prompt-enhanced GPT, TRIZ-RAGNER yields an absolute F1-score improvement of 7.3 percentage points, confirming the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented TRIZ knowledge grounding for robust and accurate patent-based contradiction mining.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23656v1,,False
SDMixer: Sparse Dual-Mixer for Time Series Forecasting,27/02/2026,Xiang Ao,"Multivariate time series forecasting is widely applied in fields such as transportation, energy, and finance. However, the data commonly suffers from issues of multi-scale characteristics, weak correlations, and noise interference, which limit the predictive performance of existing models. This paper proposes a dual-stream sparse Mixer prediction framework that extracts global trends and local dynamic features from sequences in both the frequency and time domains, respectively. It employs a sparsity mechanism to filter out invalid information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of cross-variable dependency modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that this method achieves leading performance on multiple real-world scenario datasets, validating its effectiveness and generality.

VaSST: Variational Inference for Symbolic Regression using Soft Symbolic Trees,27/02/2026,"Somjit Roy, Pritam Dey, Bani K. Mallick","Symbolic regression has recently gained traction in AI-driven scientific discovery, aiming to recover explicit closed-form expressions from data that reveal underlying physical laws. Despite recent advances, existing methods remain dominated by heuristic search algorithms or data-intensive approaches that assume low-noise regimes and lack principled uncertainty quantification. Fully probabilistic formulations are scarce, and existing Markov chain Monte Carlo-based Bayesian methods often struggle to efficiently explore the highly multimodal combinatorial space of symbolic expressions. We introduce VaSST, a scalable probabilistic framework for symbolic regression based on variational inference. VaSST employs a continuous relaxation of symbolic expression trees, termed soft symbolic trees, where discrete operator and feature assignments are replaced by soft distributions over allowable components. This relaxation transforms the combinatorial search over an astronomically large symbolic space into an efficient gradient-based optimization problem while preserving a coherent probabilistic interpretation. The learned soft representations induce posterior distributions over symbolic structures, enabling principled uncertainty quantification. Across simulated experiments and Feynman Symbolic Regression Database within SRBench, VaSST achieves superior performance in both structural recovery and predictive accuracy compared to state-of-the-art symbolic regression methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.23561v1,,False
