PROVCREATOR: Synthesizing Complex Heterogenous Graphs with Node and Edge Attributes,28/07/2025,"Tianhao Wang, Simon Klancher, Kunal Mukherjee, Josh Wiedemeier, Feng Chen, Murat Kantarcioglu, Kangkook Jee","The rise of graph-structured data has driven interest in graph learning and
synthetic data generation. While successful in text and image domains,
synthetic graph generation remains challenging -- especially for real-world
graphs with complex, heterogeneous schemas. Existing research has focused
mostly on homogeneous structures with simple attributes, limiting their
usefulness and relevance for application domains requiring semantic fidelity.
  In this research, we introduce ProvCreator, a synthetic graph framework
designed for complex heterogeneous graphs with high-dimensional node and edge
attributes. ProvCreator formulates graph synthesis as a sequence generation
task, enabling the use of transformer-based large language models. It features
a versatile graph-to-sequence encoder-decoder that 1. losslessly encodes graph
structure and attributes, 2. efficiently compresses large graphs for contextual
modeling, and 3. supports end-to-end, learnable graph generation.
  To validate our research, we evaluate ProvCreator on two challenging domains:
system provenance graphs in cybersecurity and knowledge graphs from
IntelliGraph Benchmark Dataset. In both cases, ProvCreator captures intricate
dependencies between structure and semantics, enabling the generation of
realistic and privacy-aware synthetic datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20967v1,,False
Partially Observable Monte-Carlo Graph Search,28/07/2025,"Yang You, Vincent Thomas, Alex Schutz, Robert Skilton, Nick Hawes, Olivier Buffet","Currently, large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) are
often solved by sampling-based online methods which interleave planning and
execution phases. However, a pre-computed offline policy is more desirable in
POMDP applications with time or energy constraints. But previous offline
algorithms are not able to scale up to large POMDPs. In this article, we
propose a new sampling-based algorithm, the partially observable Monte-Carlo
graph search (POMCGS) to solve large POMDPs offline. Different from many online
POMDP methods, which progressively develop a tree while performing
(Monte-Carlo) simulations, POMCGS folds this search tree on the fly to
construct a policy graph, so that computations can be drastically reduced, and
users can analyze and validate the policy prior to embedding and executing it.
Moreover, POMCGS, together with action progressive widening and observation
clustering methods provided in this article, is able to address certain
continuous POMDPs. Through experiments, we demonstrate that POMCGS can generate
policies on the most challenging POMDPs, which cannot be computed by previous
offline algorithms, and these policies' values are competitive compared with
the state-of-the-art online POMDP algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20951v1,,False
Towards Explainable Deep Clustering for Time Series Data,28/07/2025,"Udo Schlegel, Gabriel Marques Tavares, Thomas Seidl","Deep clustering uncovers hidden patterns and groups in complex time series
data, yet its opaque decision-making limits use in safety-critical settings.
This survey offers a structured overview of explainable deep clustering for
time series, collecting current methods and their real-world applications. We
thoroughly discuss and compare peer-reviewed and preprint papers through
application domains across healthcare, finance, IoT, and climate science. Our
analysis reveals that most work relies on autoencoder and attention
architectures, with limited support for streaming, irregularly sampled, or
privacy-preserved series, and interpretability is still primarily treated as an
add-on. To push the field forward, we outline six research opportunities: (1)
combining complex networks with built-in interpretability; (2) setting up
clear, faithfulness-focused evaluation metrics for unsupervised explanations;
(3) building explainers that adapt to live data streams; (4) crafting
explanations tailored to specific domains; (5) adding human-in-the-loop methods
that refine clusters and explanations together; and (6) improving our
understanding of how time series clustering models work internally. By making
interpretability a primary design goal rather than an afterthought, we propose
the groundwork for the next generation of trustworthy deep clustering time
series analytics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20840v1,,False
BuildSTG: A Multi-building Energy Load Forecasting Method using Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network,28/07/2025,"Yongzheng Liu, Yiming Wang, Po Xu, Yingjie Xu, Yuntian Chen, Dongxiao Zhang","Due to the extensive availability of operation data, data-driven methods show
strong capabilities in predicting building energy loads. Buildings with similar
features often share energy patterns, reflected by spatial dependencies in
their operational data, which conventional prediction methods struggle to
capture. To overcome this, we propose a multi-building prediction approach
using spatio-temporal graph neural networks, comprising graph representation,
graph learning, and interpretation. First, a graph is built based on building
characteristics and environmental factors. Next, a multi-level graph
convolutional architecture with attention is developed for energy prediction.
Lastly, a method interpreting the optimized graph structure is introduced.
Experiments on the Building Data Genome Project 2 dataset confirm superior
performance over baselines such as XGBoost, SVR, FCNN, GRU, and Naive,
highlighting the method's robustness, generalization, and interpretability in
capturing meaningful building similarities and spatial relationships.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20838v1,,False
First Hallucination Tokens Are Different from Conditional Ones,28/07/2025,"Jakob Snel, Seong Joon Oh","Hallucination, the generation of untruthful content, is one of the major
concerns regarding foundational models. Detecting hallucinations at the token
level is vital for real-time filtering and targeted correction, yet the
variation of hallucination signals within token sequences is not fully
understood. Leveraging the RAGTruth corpus with token-level annotations and
reproduced logits, we analyse how these signals depend on a token's position
within hallucinated spans, contributing to an improved understanding of
token-level hallucination. Our results show that the first hallucinated token
carries a stronger signal and is more detectable than conditional tokens. We
release our analysis framework, along with code for logit reproduction and
metric computation at https://github.com/jakobsnl/RAGTruth_Xtended.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20836v1,,False
Algorithmic Fairness: A Runtime Perspective,28/07/2025,"Filip Cano, Thomas A. Henzinger, Konstantin Kueffner","Fairness in AI is traditionally studied as a static property evaluated once,
over a fixed dataset. However, real-world AI systems operate sequentially, with
outcomes and environments evolving over time. This paper proposes a framework
for analysing fairness as a runtime property. Using a minimal yet expressive
model based on sequences of coin tosses with possibly evolving biases, we study
the problems of monitoring and enforcing fairness expressed in either toss
outcomes or coin biases. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution for
either problem, we provide a summary of monitoring and enforcement strategies,
parametrised by environment dynamics, prediction horizon, and confidence
thresholds. For both problems, we present general results under simple or
minimal assumptions. We survey existing solutions for the monitoring problem
for Markovian and additive dynamics, and existing solutions for the enforcement
problem in static settings with known dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20711v1,,False
Deep Generative Models of Evolution: SNP-level Population Adaptation by Genomic Linkage Incorporation,28/07/2025,"Julia Siekiera, Christian Schl√∂tterer, Stefan Kramer","The investigation of allele frequency trajectories in populations evolving
under controlled environmental pressures has become a popular approach to study
evolutionary processes on the molecular level. Statistical models based on
well-defined evolutionary concepts can be used to validate different hypotheses
about empirical observations. Despite their popularity, classic statistical
models like the Wright-Fisher model suffer from simplified assumptions such as
the independence of selected loci along a chromosome and uncertainty about the
parameters. Deep generative neural networks offer a powerful alternative known
for the integration of multivariate dependencies and noise reduction. Due to
their high data demands and challenging interpretability they have, so far, not
been widely considered in the area of population genomics. To address the
challenges in the area of Evolve and Resequencing experiments (E&R) based on
pooled sequencing (Pool-Seq) data, we introduce a deep generative neural
network that aims to model a concept of evolution based on empirical
observations over time. The proposed model estimates the distribution of allele
frequency trajectories by embedding the observations from single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with information from neighboring loci. Evaluation on
simulated E&R experiments demonstrates the model's ability to capture the
distribution of allele frequency trajectories and illustrates the
representational power of deep generative models on the example of linkage
disequilibrium (LD) estimation. Inspecting the internally learned
representations enables estimating pairwise LD, which is typically inaccessible
in Pool-Seq data. Our model provides competitive LD estimation in Pool-Seq data
high degree of LD when compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20644v1,,False
Fusing CFD and measurement data using transfer learning,28/07/2025,"Alexander Barklage, Philipp Bekemeyer","Aerodynamic analysis during aircraft design usually involves methods of
varying accuracy and spatial resolution, which all have their advantages and
disadvantages. It is therefore desirable to create data-driven models which
effectively combine these advantages. Such data fusion methods for distributed
quantities mainly rely on proper orthogonal decomposition as of now, which is a
linear method. In this paper, we introduce a non-linear method based on neural
networks combining simulation and measurement data via transfer learning. The
network training accounts for the heterogeneity of the data, as simulation data
usually features a high spatial resolution, while measurement data is sparse
but more accurate. In a first step, the neural network is trained on simulation
data to learn spatial features of the distributed quantities. The second step
involves transfer learning on the measurement data to correct for systematic
errors between simulation and measurement by only re-training a small subset of
the entire neural network model. This approach is applied to a multilayer
perceptron architecture and shows significant improvements over the established
method based on proper orthogonal decomposition by producing more physical
solutions near nonlinearities. In addition, the neural network provides
solutions at arbitrary flow conditions, thus making the model useful for flight
mechanical design, structural sizing, and certification. As the proposed
training strategy is very general, it can also be applied to more complex
neural network architectures in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20576v1,,False
Implicit Spatiotemporal Bandwidth Enhancement Filter by Sine-activated Deep Learning Model for Fast 3D Photoacoustic Tomography,28/07/2025,"I Gede Eka Sulistyawan, Takuro Ishii, Riku Suzuki, Yoshifumi Saijo","3D photoacoustic tomography (3D-PAT) using high-frequency hemispherical
transducers offers near-omnidirectional reception and enhanced sensitivity to
the finer structural details encoded in the high-frequency components of the
broadband photoacoustic (PA) signal. However, practical constraints such as
limited number of channels with bandlimited sampling rate often result in
sparse and bandlimited sensors that degrade image quality. To address this, we
revisit the 2D deep learning (DL) approach applied directly to sensor-wise PA
radio-frequency (PARF) data. Specifically, we introduce sine activation into
the DL model to restore the broadband nature of PARF signals given the observed
band-limited and high-frequency PARF data. Given the scarcity of 3D training
data, we employ simplified training strategies by simulating random spherical
absorbers. This combination of sine-activated model and randomized training is
designed to emphasize bandwidth learning over dataset memorization. Our model
was evaluated on a leaf skeleton phantom, a micro-CT-verified 3D spiral phantom
and in-vivo human palm vasculature. The results showed that the proposed
training mechanism on sine-activated model was well-generalized across the
different tests by effectively increasing the sensor density and recovering the
spatiotemporal bandwidth. Qualitatively, the sine-activated model uniquely
enhanced high-frequency content that produces clearer vascular structure with
fewer artefacts. Quantitatively, the sine-activated model exhibits full
bandwidth at -12 dB spectrum and significantly higher contrast-to-noise ratio
with minimal loss of structural similarity index. Lastly, we optimized our
approach to enable fast enhanced 3D-PAT at 2 volumes-per-second for better
practical imaging of a free-moving targets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20575v1,,False
MemoryTalker: Personalized Speech-Driven 3D Facial Animation via Audio-Guided Stylization,28/07/2025,"Hyung Kyu Kim, Sangmin Lee, Hak Gu Kim","Speech-driven 3D facial animation aims to synthesize realistic facial motion
sequences from given audio, matching the speaker's speaking style. However,
previous works often require priors such as class labels of a speaker or
additional 3D facial meshes at inference, which makes them fail to reflect the
speaking style and limits their practical use. To address these issues, we
propose MemoryTalker which enables realistic and accurate 3D facial motion
synthesis by reflecting speaking style only with audio input to maximize
usability in applications. Our framework consists of two training stages:
1-stage is storing and retrieving general motion (i.e., Memorizing), and
2-stage is to perform the personalized facial motion synthesis (i.e.,
Animating) with the motion memory stylized by the audio-driven speaking style
feature. In this second stage, our model learns about which facial motion types
should be emphasized for a particular piece of audio. As a result, our
MemoryTalker can generate a reliable personalized facial animation without
additional prior information. With quantitative and qualitative evaluations, as
well as user study, we show the effectiveness of our model and its performance
enhancement for personalized facial animation over state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20562v1,,False
LLMs-guided adaptive compensator: Bringing Adaptivity to Automatic Control Systems with Large Language Models,28/07/2025,"Zhongchao Zhou, Yuxi Lu, Yaonan Zhu, Yifan Zhao, Bin He, Liang He, Wenwen Yu, Yusuke Iwasawa","With rapid advances in code generation, reasoning, and problem-solving, Large
Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in robotics. Most existing work
focuses on high-level tasks such as task decomposition. A few studies have
explored the use of LLMs in feedback controller design; however, these efforts
are restricted to overly simplified systems, fixed-structure gain tuning, and
lack real-world validation. To further investigate LLMs in automatic control,
this work targets a key subfield: adaptive control. Inspired by the framework
of model reference adaptive control (MRAC), we propose an LLM-guided adaptive
compensator framework that avoids designing controllers from scratch. Instead,
the LLMs are prompted using the discrepancies between an unknown system and a
reference system to design a compensator that aligns the response of the
unknown system with that of the reference, thereby achieving adaptivity.
Experiments evaluate five methods: LLM-guided adaptive compensator, LLM-guided
adaptive controller, indirect adaptive control, learning-based adaptive
control, and MRAC, on soft and humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world
environments. Results show that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator outperforms
traditional adaptive controllers and significantly reduces reasoning complexity
compared to the LLM-guided adaptive controller. The Lyapunov-based analysis and
reasoning-path inspection demonstrate that the LLM-guided adaptive compensator
enables a more structured design process by transforming mathematical
derivation into a reasoning task, while exhibiting strong generalizability,
adaptability, and robustness. This study opens a new direction for applying
LLMs in the field of automatic control, offering greater deployability and
practicality compared to vision-language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20509v1,,False
Provable In-Context Learning of Nonlinear Regression with Transformers,28/07/2025,"Hongbo Li, Lingjie Duan, Yingbin Liang","The transformer architecture, which processes sequences of input tokens to
produce outputs for query tokens, has revolutionized numerous areas of machine
learning. A defining feature of transformers is their ability to perform
previously unseen tasks using task-specific prompts without updating
parameters, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent research
has actively explored the training dynamics behind ICL, with much of the focus
on relatively simple tasks such as linear regression and binary classification.
To advance the theoretical understanding of ICL, this paper investigates more
complex nonlinear regression tasks, aiming to uncover how transformers acquire
in-context learning capabilities in these settings. We analyze the stage-wise
dynamics of attention during training: attention scores between a query token
and its target features grow rapidly in the early phase, then gradually
converge to one, while attention to irrelevant features decays more slowly and
exhibits oscillatory behavior. Our analysis introduces new proof techniques
that explicitly characterize how the nature of general non-degenerate
L-Lipschitz task functions affects attention weights. Specifically, we identify
that the Lipschitz constant L of nonlinear function classes as a key factor
governing the convergence dynamics of transformers in ICL. Leveraging these
insights, for two distinct regimes depending on whether L is below or above a
threshold, we derive different time bounds to guarantee near-zero prediction
error. Notably, despite the convergence time depending on the underlying task
functions, we prove that query tokens consistently attend to prompt tokens with
highly relevant features at convergence, demonstrating the ICL capability of
transformers for unseen functions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.20443v1,,False
