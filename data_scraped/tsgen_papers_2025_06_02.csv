DiG-Net: Enhancing Quality of Life through Hyper-Range Dynamic Gesture Recognition in Assistive Robotics,30/05/2025,"Eran Bamani Beeri, Eden Nissinman, Avishai Sintov","Dynamic hand gestures play a pivotal role in assistive human-robot
interaction (HRI), facilitating intuitive, non-verbal communication,
particularly for individuals with mobility constraints or those operating
robots remotely. Current gesture recognition methods are mostly limited to
short-range interactions, reducing their utility in scenarios demanding robust
assistive communication from afar. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach
designed specifically for assistive robotics, enabling dynamic gesture
recognition at extended distances of up to 30 meters, thereby significantly
improving accessibility and quality of life. Our proposed Distance-aware
Gesture Network (DiG-Net) effectively combines Depth-Conditioned Deformable
Alignment (DADA) blocks with Spatio-Temporal Graph modules, enabling robust
processing and classification of gesture sequences captured under challenging
conditions, including significant physical attenuation, reduced resolution, and
dynamic gesture variations commonly experienced in real-world assistive
environments. We further introduce the Radiometric Spatio-Temporal Depth
Attenuation Loss (RSTDAL), shown to enhance learning and strengthen model
robustness across varying distances. Our model demonstrates significant
performance improvement over state-of-the-art gesture recognition frameworks,
achieving a recognition accuracy of 97.3% on a diverse dataset with challenging
hyper-range gestures. By effectively interpreting gestures from considerable
distances, DiG-Net significantly enhances the usability of assistive robots in
home healthcare, industrial safety, and remote assistance scenarios, enabling
seamless and intuitive interactions for users regardless of physical
limitations",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24786v1,,False
QGAN-based data augmentation for hybrid quantum-classical neural networks,30/05/2025,"Run-Ze He, Jun-Jian Su, Su-Juan Qin, Zheng-Ping Jin, Fei Gao","Quantum neural networks converge faster and achieve higher accuracy than
classical models. However, data augmentation in quantum machine learning
remains underexplored. To tackle data scarcity, we integrate quantum generative
adversarial networks (QGANs) with hybrid quantum-classical neural networks
(HQCNNs) to develop an augmentation framework. We propose two strategies: a
general approach to enhance data processing and classification across HQCNNs,
and a customized strategy that dynamically generates samples tailored to the
HQCNN's performance on specific data categories, improving its ability to learn
from complex datasets. Simulation experiments on the MNIST dataset demonstrate
that QGAN outperforms traditional data augmentation methods and classical GANs.
Compared to baseline DCGAN, QGAN achieves comparable performance with half the
parameters, balancing efficiency and effectiveness. This suggests that QGANs
can simplify models and generate high-quality data, enhancing HQCNN accuracy
and performance. These findings pave the way for applying quantum data
augmentation techniques in machine learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24780v1,,False
PDE-Transformer: Efficient and Versatile Transformers for Physics Simulations,30/05/2025,"Benjamin Holzschuh, Qiang Liu, Georg Kohl, Nils Thuerey","We introduce PDE-Transformer, an improved transformer-based architecture for
surrogate modeling of physics simulations on regular grids. We combine recent
architectural improvements of diffusion transformers with adjustments specific
for large-scale simulations to yield a more scalable and versatile
general-purpose transformer architecture, which can be used as the backbone for
building large-scale foundation models in physical sciences. We demonstrate
that our proposed architecture outperforms state-of-the-art transformer
architectures for computer vision on a large dataset of 16 different types of
PDEs. We propose to embed different physical channels individually as
spatio-temporal tokens, which interact via channel-wise self-attention. This
helps to maintain a consistent information density of tokens when learning
multiple types of PDEs simultaneously. We demonstrate that our pre-trained
models achieve improved performance on several challenging downstream tasks
compared to training from scratch and also beat other foundation model
architectures for physics simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24717v1,,False
Learning from Videos for 3D World: Enhancing MLLMs with 3D Vision Geometry Priors,30/05/2025,"Duo Zheng, Shijia Huang, Yanyang Li, Liwei Wang","Previous research has investigated the application of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs) in understanding 3D scenes by interpreting them as
videos. These approaches generally depend on comprehensive 3D data inputs, such
as point clouds or reconstructed Bird's-Eye View (BEV) maps. In our research,
we advance this field by enhancing the capability of MLLMs to understand and
reason in 3D spaces directly from video data, without the need for additional
3D input. We propose a novel and efficient method, the Video-3D Geometry Large
Language Model (VG LLM). Our approach employs a 3D visual geometry encoder that
extracts 3D prior information from video sequences. This information is
integrated with visual tokens and fed into the MLLM. Extensive experiments have
shown that our method has achieved substantial improvements in various tasks
related to 3D scene understanding and spatial reasoning, all directly learned
from video sources. Impressively, our 4B model, which does not rely on explicit
3D data inputs, achieves competitive results compared to existing
state-of-the-art methods, and even surpasses the Gemini-1.5-Pro in the
VSI-Bench evaluations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24625v1,,False
A Flat Minima Perspective on Understanding Augmentations and Model Robustness,30/05/2025,"Weebum Yoo, Sung Whan Yoon","Model robustness indicates a model's capability to generalize well on
unforeseen distributional shifts, including data corruption, adversarial
attacks, and domain shifts. Data augmentation is one of the prevalent and
effective ways to enhance robustness. Despite the great success of
augmentations in different fields, a general theoretical understanding of their
efficacy in improving model robustness is lacking. We offer a unified
theoretical framework to clarify how augmentations can enhance model robustness
through the lens of loss surface flatness and PAC generalization bound. Our
work diverges from prior studies in that our analysis i) broadly encompasses
much of the existing augmentation methods, and ii) is not limited to specific
types of distribution shifts like adversarial attacks. We confirm our theories
through simulations on the existing common corruption and adversarial
robustness benchmarks based on the CIFAR and ImageNet datasets, as well as
domain generalization benchmarks including PACS and OfficeHome.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24592v1,,False
"AutoChemSchematic AI: A Closed-Loop, Physics-Aware Agentic Framework for Auto-Generating Chemical Process and Instrumentation Diagrams",30/05/2025,"Sakhinana Sagar Srinivas, Shivam Gupta, Venkataramana Runkana","Recent advancements in generative AI have accelerated the discovery of novel
chemicals and materials; however, transitioning these discoveries to
industrial-scale production remains a critical bottleneck, as it requires the
development of entirely new chemical manufacturing processes. Current AI
methods cannot auto-generate PFDs or PIDs, despite their critical role in
scaling chemical processes, while adhering to engineering constraints. We
present a closed loop, physics aware framework for the automated generation of
industrially viable PFDs and PIDs. The framework integrates domain specialized
small scale language models (SLMs) (trained for chemical process QA tasks) with
first principles simulation, leveraging three key components: (1) a
hierarchical knowledge graph of process flow and instrumentation descriptions
for 1,020+ chemicals, (2) a multi-stage training pipeline that fine tunes
domain specialized SLMs on synthetic datasets via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Retrieval-Augmented Instruction
Tuning (RAIT), and (3) DWSIM based simulator in the loop validation to ensure
feasibility. To improve both runtime efficiency and model compactness, the
framework incorporates advanced inference time optimizations including
FlashAttention, Lookahead Decoding, PagedAttention with KV-cache quantization,
and Test Time Inference Scaling and independently applies structural pruning
techniques (width and depth) guided by importance heuristics to reduce model
size with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments demonstrate that the framework
generates simulator-validated process descriptions with high fidelity,
outperforms baseline methods in correctness, and generalizes to unseen
chemicals. By bridging AI-driven design with industrial-scale feasibility, this
work significantly reduces R&D timelines from lab discovery to plant
deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24584v1,,False
Cross-Attention Speculative Decoding,30/05/2025,"Wei Zhong, Manasa Bharadwaj, Yixiao Wang, Nikhil Verma, Yipeng Ji, Chul Lee","Speculative decoding (SD) is a widely adopted approach for accelerating
inference in large language models (LLMs), particularly when the draft and
target models are well aligned. However, state-of-the-art SD methods typically
rely on tightly coupled, self-attention-based Transformer decoders, often
augmented with auxiliary pooling or fusion layers. This coupling makes them
increasingly complex and harder to generalize across different models. We
present Budget EAGLE (Beagle), the first, to our knowledge,
cross-attention-based Transformer decoder SD model that achieves performance on
par with leading self-attention SD models (EAGLE-v2) while eliminating the need
for pooling or auxiliary components, simplifying the architecture, improving
training efficiency, and maintaining stable memory usage during training-time
simulation. To enable effective training of this novel architecture, we propose
Two-Stage Block-Attention Training, a new method that achieves training
stability and convergence efficiency in block-level attention scenarios.
Extensive experiments across multiple LLMs and datasets show that Beagle
achieves competitive inference speedups and higher training efficiency than
EAGLE-v2, offering a strong alternative for architectures in speculative
decoding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24544v1,,False
Real-time Fall Prevention system for the Next-generation of Workers,30/05/2025,"Nicholas Cartocci, Antonios E. Gkikakis, Darwin G. Caldwell, Jesús Ortiz","Developing a general-purpose wearable real-time fall-detection system is
still a challenging task, especially for healthy and strong subjects, such as
industrial workers that work in harsh environments. In this work, we present a
hybrid approach for fall detection and prevention, which uses the dynamic model
of an inverted pendulum to generate simulations of falling that are then fed to
a deep learning framework. The output is a signal to activate a fall mitigation
mechanism when the subject is at risk of harm. The advantage of this approach
is that abstracted models can be used to efficiently generate training data for
thousands of different subjects with different falling initial conditions,
something that is practically impossible with real experiments. This approach
is suitable for a specific type of fall, where the subjects fall without
changing their initial configuration significantly, and it is the first step
toward a general-purpose wearable device, with the aim of reducing
fall-associated injuries in industrial environments, which can improve the
safety of workers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24487v1,,False
P: A Universal Measure of Predictive Intelligence,30/05/2025,David Gamez,"Over the last thirty years, considerable progress has been made with the
development of systems that can drive cars, play games, predict protein folding
and generate natural language. These systems are described as intelligent and
there has been a great deal of talk about the rapid increase in artificial
intelligence and its potential dangers. However, our theoretical understanding
of intelligence and ability to measure it lag far behind our capacity for
building systems that mimic intelligent human behaviour. There is no commonly
agreed definition of the intelligence that AI systems are said to possess.
No-one has developed a practical measure that would enable us to compare the
intelligence of humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.
  This paper sets out a new universal measure of intelligence that is based on
the hypothesis that prediction is the most important component of intelligence.
As an agent interacts with its normal environment, the accuracy of its
predictions is summed up and the complexity of its predictions and perceived
environment is accounted for using Kolmogorov complexity. Two experiments were
carried out to evaluate the practical feasibility of the algorithm. These
demonstrated that it could measure the intelligence of an agent embodied in a
virtual maze and an agent that makes predictions about time-series data. This
universal measure could be the starting point for a new comparative science of
intelligence that ranks humans, animals and AIs on a single ratio scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24426v1,,False
Boosting Automatic Exercise Evaluation Through Musculoskeletal Simulation-Based IMU Data Augmentation,30/05/2025,"Andreas Spilz, Heiko Oppel, Michael Munz","Automated evaluation of movement quality holds significant potential for
enhancing physiotherapeutic treatments and sports training by providing
objective, real-time feedback. However, the effectiveness of deep learning
models in assessing movements captured by inertial measurement units (IMUs) is
often hampered by limited data availability, class imbalance, and label
ambiguity. In this work, we present a novel data augmentation method that
generates realistic IMU data using musculoskeletal simulations integrated with
systematic modifications of movement trajectories. Crucially, our approach
ensures biomechanical plausibility and allows for automatic, reliable labeling
by combining inverse kinematic parameters with a knowledge-based evaluation
strategy. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that augmented variants closely
resembles real-world data, significantly improving the classification accuracy
and generalization capability of neural network models. Additionally, we
highlight the benefits of augmented data for patient-specific fine-tuning
scenarios, particularly when only limited subject-specific training examples
are available. Our findings underline the practicality and efficacy of this
augmentation method in overcoming common challenges faced by deep learning
applications in physiotherapeutic exercise evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24415v1,,False
Neural Drift Estimation for Ergodic Diffusions: Non-parametric Analysis and Numerical Exploration,30/05/2025,"Simone Di Gregorio, Francesco Iafrate","We take into consideration generalization bounds for the problem of the
estimation of the drift component for ergodic stochastic differential
equations, when the estimator is a ReLU neural network and the estimation is
non-parametric with respect to the statistical model. We show a practical way
to enforce the theoretical estimation procedure, enabling inference on noisy
and rough functional data. Results are shown for a simulated It\^o-Taylor
approximation of the sample paths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24383v1,10.1007/978-3-031-92383-8_20,False
Interpreting Large Text-to-Image Diffusion Models with Dictionary Learning,30/05/2025,"Stepan Shabalin, Ayush Panda, Dmitrii Kharlapenko, Abdur Raheem Ali, Yixiong Hao, Arthur Conmy","Sparse autoencoders are a promising new approach for decomposing language
model activations for interpretation and control. They have been applied
successfully to vision transformer image encoders and to small-scale diffusion
models. Inference-Time Decomposition of Activations (ITDA) is a recently
proposed variant of dictionary learning that takes the dictionary to be a set
of data points from the activation distribution and reconstructs them with
gradient pursuit. We apply Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) and ITDA to a large
text-to-image diffusion model, Flux 1, and consider the interpretability of
embeddings of both by introducing a visual automated interpretation pipeline.
We find that SAEs accurately reconstruct residual stream embeddings and beat
MLP neurons on interpretability. We are able to use SAE features to steer image
generation through activation addition. We find that ITDA has comparable
interpretability to SAEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24360v1,,False
How Much Backtracking is Enough? Exploring the Interplay of SFT and RL in Enhancing LLM Reasoning,30/05/2025,"Hongyi James Cai, Junlin Wang, Xiaoyin Chen, Bhuwan Dhingra","Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have effectively
improved their reasoning abilities, particularly on mathematical and logical
problems that have verifiable answers, through techniques such as supervised
finetuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL). Prior research indicates that
RL effectively internalizes search strategies, enabling long chain-of-thought
(CoT) reasoning, with backtracking emerging naturally as a learned capability.
However, the precise benefits of backtracking, specifically, how significantly
it contributes to reasoning improvements and the optimal extent of its use,
remain poorly understood. In this work, we systematically investigate the
dynamics between SFT and RL on eight reasoning tasks: Countdown, Sudoku, Arc
1D, Geometry, Color Cube Rotation, List Functions, Zebra Puzzles, and Self
Reference. Our findings highlight that short CoT sequences used in SFT as a
warm-up do have moderate contribution to RL training, compared with cold-start
RL; however such contribution diminishes when tasks become increasingly
difficult. Motivated by this observation, we construct synthetic datasets
varying systematically in the number of backtracking steps and conduct
controlled experiments to isolate the influence of either the correctness
(content) or the structure (i.e., backtrack frequency). We find that (1) longer
CoT with backtracks generally induce better and more stable RL training, (2)
more challenging problems with larger search space tend to need higher numbers
of backtracks during the SFT stage. Additionally, we demonstrate through
experiments on distilled data that RL training is largely unaffected by the
correctness of long CoT sequences, suggesting that RL prioritizes structural
patterns over content correctness. Collectively, our results offer practical
insights into designing optimal training strategies to effectively scale
reasoning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24273v1,,False
Aligning Protein Conformation Ensemble Generation with Physical Feedback,30/05/2025,"Jiarui Lu, Xiaoyin Chen, Stephen Zhewen Lu, Aurélie Lozano, Vijil Chenthamarakshan, Payel Das, Jian Tang","Protein dynamics play a crucial role in protein biological functions and
properties, and their traditional study typically relies on time-consuming
molecular dynamics (MD) simulations conducted in silico. Recent advances in
generative modeling, particularly denoising diffusion models, have enabled
efficient accurate protein structure prediction and conformation sampling by
learning distributions over crystallographic structures. However, effectively
integrating physical supervision into these data-driven approaches remains
challenging, as standard energy-based objectives often lead to intractable
optimization. In this paper, we introduce Energy-based Alignment (EBA), a
method that aligns generative models with feedback from physical models,
efficiently calibrating them to appropriately balance conformational states
based on their energy differences. Experimental results on the MD ensemble
benchmark demonstrate that EBA achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-quality protein ensembles. By improving the physical
plausibility of generated structures, our approach enhances model predictions
and holds promise for applications in structural biology and drug discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24203v1,,False
LKD-KGC: Domain-Specific KG Construction via LLM-driven Knowledge Dependency Parsing,30/05/2025,"Jiaqi Sun, Shiyou Qian, Zhangchi Han, Wei Li, Zelin Qian, Dingyu Yang, Jian Cao, Guangtao Xue","Knowledge Graphs (KGs) structure real-world entities and their relationships
into triples, enhancing machine reasoning for various tasks. While
domain-specific KGs offer substantial benefits, their manual construction is
often inefficient and requires specialized knowledge. Recent approaches for
knowledge graph construction (KGC) based on large language models (LLMs), such
as schema-guided KGC and reference knowledge integration, have proven
efficient. However, these methods are constrained by their reliance on manually
defined schema, single-document processing, and public-domain references,
making them less effective for domain-specific corpora that exhibit complex
knowledge dependencies and specificity, as well as limited reference knowledge.
To address these challenges, we propose LKD-KGC, a novel framework for
unsupervised domain-specific KG construction. LKD-KGC autonomously analyzes
document repositories to infer knowledge dependencies, determines optimal
processing sequences via LLM driven prioritization, and autoregressively
generates entity schema by integrating hierarchical inter-document contexts.
This schema guides the unsupervised extraction of entities and relationships,
eliminating reliance on predefined structures or external knowledge. Extensive
experiments show that compared with state-of-the-art baselines, LKD-KGC
generally achieves improvements of 10% to 20% in both precision and recall
rate, demonstrating its potential in constructing high-quality domain-specific
KGs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.24163v1,,False
