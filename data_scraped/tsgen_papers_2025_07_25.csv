SIDA: Synthetic Image Driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation,24/07/2025,"Ye-Chan Kim, SeungJu Cha, Si-Woo Kim, Taewhan Kim, Dong-Jin Kim","Zero-shot domain adaptation is a method for adapting a model to a target
domain without utilizing target domain image data. To enable adaptation without
target images, existing studies utilize CLIP's embedding space and text
description to simulate target-like style features. Despite the previous
achievements in zero-shot domain adaptation, we observe that these text-driven
methods struggle to capture complex real-world variations and significantly
increase adaptation time due to their alignment process. Instead of relying on
text descriptions, we explore solutions leveraging image data, which provides
diverse and more fine-grained style cues. In this work, we propose SIDA, a
novel and efficient zero-shot domain adaptation method leveraging synthetic
images. To generate synthetic images, we first create detailed, source-like
images and apply image translation to reflect the style of the target domain.
We then utilize the style features of these synthetic images as a proxy for the
target domain. Based on these features, we introduce Domain Mix and Patch Style
Transfer modules, which enable effective modeling of real-world variations. In
particular, Domain Mix blends multiple styles to expand the intra-domain
representations, and Patch Style Transfer assigns different styles to
individual patches. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method by showing
state-of-the-art performance in diverse zero-shot adaptation scenarios,
particularly in challenging domains. Moreover, our approach achieves high
efficiency by significantly reducing the overall adaptation time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18632v1,,False
Demystify Protein Generation with Hierarchical Conditional Diffusion Models,24/07/2025,"Zinan Ling, Yi Shi, Da Yan, Yang Zhou, Bo Hui","Generating novel and functional protein sequences is critical to a wide range
of applications in biology. Recent advancements in conditional diffusion models
have shown impressive empirical performance in protein generation tasks.
However, reliable generations of protein remain an open research question in de
novo protein design, especially when it comes to conditional diffusion models.
Considering the biological function of a protein is determined by multi-level
structures, we propose a novel multi-level conditional diffusion model that
integrates both sequence-based and structure-based information for efficient
end-to-end protein design guided by specified functions. By generating
representations at different levels simultaneously, our framework can
effectively model the inherent hierarchical relations between different levels,
resulting in an informative and discriminative representation of the generated
protein. We also propose a Protein-MMD, a new reliable evaluation metric, to
evaluate the quality of generated protein with conditional diffusion models.
Our new metric is able to capture both distributional and functional
similarities between real and generated protein sequences while ensuring
conditional consistency. We experiment with the benchmark datasets, and the
results on conditional protein generation tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the
proposed generation framework and evaluation metric.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18603v1,,False
PosterMate: Audience-driven Collaborative Persona Agents for Poster Design,24/07/2025,"Donghoon Shin, Daniel Lee, Gary Hsieh, Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan","Poster designing can benefit from synchronous feedback from target audiences.
However, gathering audiences with diverse perspectives and reconciling them on
design edits can be challenging. Recent generative AI models present
opportunities to simulate human-like interactions, but it is unclear how they
may be used for feedback processes in design. We introduce PosterMate, a poster
design assistant that facilitates collaboration by creating audience-driven
persona agents constructed from marketing documents. PosterMate gathers
feedback from each persona agent regarding poster components, and stimulates
discussion with the help of a moderator to reach a conclusion. These
agreed-upon edits can then be directly integrated into the poster design.
Through our user study (N=12), we identified the potential of PosterMate to
capture overlooked viewpoints, while serving as an effective prototyping tool.
Additionally, our controlled online evaluation (N=100) revealed that the
feedback from an individual persona agent is appropriate given its persona
identity, and the discussion effectively synthesizes the different persona
agents' perspectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18572v1,10.1145/3746059.3747769,False
Euclidean Distance Deflation Under High-Dimensional Heteroskedastic Noise,24/07/2025,"Keyi Li, Yuval Kluger, Boris Landa","Pairwise Euclidean distance calculation is a fundamental step in many machine
learning and data analysis algorithms. In real-world applications, however,
these distances are frequently distorted by heteroskedastic
noise$\unicode{x2014}$a prevalent form of inhomogeneous corruption
characterized by variable noise magnitudes across data observations. Such noise
inflates the computed distances in a nontrivial way, leading to
misrepresentations of the underlying data geometry. In this work, we address
the tasks of estimating the noise magnitudes per observation and correcting the
pairwise Euclidean distances under heteroskedastic noise. Perhaps surprisingly,
we show that in general high-dimensional settings and without assuming prior
knowledge on the clean data structure or noise distribution, both tasks can be
performed reliably, even when the noise levels vary considerably. Specifically,
we develop a principled, hyperparameter-free approach that jointly estimates
the noise magnitudes and corrects the distances. We provide theoretical
guarantees for our approach, establishing probabilistic bounds on the
estimation errors of both noise magnitudes and distances. These bounds,
measured in the normalized $\ell_1$ norm, converge to zero at polynomial rates
as both feature dimension and dataset size increase. Experiments on synthetic
datasets demonstrate that our method accurately estimates distances in
challenging regimes, significantly improving the robustness of subsequent
distance-based computations. Notably, when applied to single-cell RNA
sequencing data, our method yields noise magnitude estimates consistent with an
established prototypical model, enabling accurate nearest neighbor
identification that is fundamental to many downstream analyses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18520v1,,False
FinDPO: Financial Sentiment Analysis for Algorithmic Trading through Preference Optimization of LLMs,24/07/2025,"Giorgos Iacovides, Wuyang Zhou, Danilo Mandic","Opinions expressed in online finance-related textual data are having an
increasingly profound impact on trading decisions and market movements. This
trend highlights the vital role of sentiment analysis as a tool for quantifying
the nature and strength of such opinions. With the rapid development of
Generative AI (GenAI), supervised fine-tuned (SFT) large language models (LLMs)
have become the de facto standard for financial sentiment analysis. However,
the SFT paradigm can lead to memorization of the training data and often fails
to generalize to unseen samples. This is a critical limitation in financial
domains, where models must adapt to previously unobserved events and the
nuanced, domain-specific language of finance. To this end, we introduce FinDPO,
the first finance-specific LLM framework based on post-training human
preference alignment via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The proposed
FinDPO achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard sentiment
classification benchmarks, outperforming existing supervised fine-tuned models
by 11% on the average. Uniquely, the FinDPO framework enables the integration
of a fine-tuned causal LLM into realistic portfolio strategies through a novel
'logit-to-score' conversion, which transforms discrete sentiment predictions
into continuous, rankable sentiment scores (probabilities). In this way,
simulations demonstrate that FinDPO is the first sentiment-based approach to
maintain substantial positive returns of 67% annually and strong risk-adjusted
performance, as indicated by a Sharpe ratio of 2.0, even under realistic
transaction costs of 5 basis points (bps).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18417v1,,False
ReSem3D: Refinable 3D Spatial Constraints via Fine-Grained Semantic Grounding for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation,24/07/2025,"Chenyu Su, Weiwei Shang, Chen Qian, Fei Zhang, Shuang Cong","Semantics-driven 3D spatial constraints align highlevel semantic
representations with low-level action spaces, facilitating the unification of
task understanding and execution in robotic manipulation. The synergistic
reasoning of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and Vision Foundation
Models (VFMs) enables cross-modal 3D spatial constraint construction.
Nevertheless, existing methods have three key limitations: (1) coarse semantic
granularity in constraint modeling, (2) lack of real-time closed-loop planning,
(3) compromised robustness in semantically diverse environments. To address
these challenges, we propose ReSem3D, a unified manipulation framework for
semantically diverse environments, leveraging the synergy between VFMs and
MLLMs to achieve fine-grained visual grounding and dynamically constructs
hierarchical 3D spatial constraints for real-time manipulation. Specifically,
the framework is driven by hierarchical recursive reasoning in MLLMs, which
interact with VFMs to automatically construct 3D spatial constraints from
natural language instructions and RGB-D observations in two stages: part-level
extraction and region-level refinement. Subsequently, these constraints are
encoded as real-time optimization objectives in joint space, enabling reactive
behavior to dynamic disturbances. Extensive simulation and real-world
experiments are conducted in semantically rich household and sparse chemical
lab environments. The results demonstrate that ReSem3D performs diverse
manipulation tasks under zero-shot conditions, exhibiting strong adaptability
and generalization. Code and videos at https://resem3d.github.io.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18262v1,,False
Multimodal Behavioral Patterns Analysis with Eye-Tracking and LLM-Based Reasoning,24/07/2025,"Dongyang Guo, Yasmeen Abdrabou, Enkeleda Thaqi, Enkelejda Kasneci","Eye-tracking data reveals valuable insights into users' cognitive states but
is difficult to analyze due to its structured, non-linguistic nature. While
large language models (LLMs) excel at reasoning over text, they struggle with
temporal and numerical data. This paper presents a multimodal human-AI
collaborative framework designed to enhance cognitive pattern extraction from
eye-tracking signals. The framework includes: (1) a multi-stage pipeline using
horizontal and vertical segmentation alongside LLM reasoning to uncover latent
gaze patterns; (2) an Expert-Model Co-Scoring Module that integrates expert
judgment with LLM output to generate trust scores for behavioral
interpretations; and (3) a hybrid anomaly detection module combining LSTM-based
temporal modeling with LLM-driven semantic analysis. Our results across several
LLMs and prompt strategies show improvements in consistency, interpretability,
and performance, with up to 50% accuracy in difficulty prediction tasks. This
approach offers a scalable, interpretable solution for cognitive modeling and
has broad potential in adaptive learning, human-computer interaction, and
educational analytics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18252v1,,False
From Individual Learning to Market Equilibrium: Correcting Structural and Parametric Biases in RL Simulations of Economic Models,24/07/2025,"Zeqiang Zhang, Ruxin Chen","The application of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to economic modeling reveals a
fundamental conflict between the assumptions of equilibrium theory and the
emergent behavior of learning agents. While canonical economic models assume
atomistic agents act as `takers' of aggregate market conditions, a naive
single-agent RL simulation incentivizes the agent to become a `manipulator' of
its environment. This paper first demonstrates this discrepancy within a
search-and-matching model with concave production, showing that a standard RL
agent learns a non-equilibrium, monopsonistic policy. Additionally, we identify
a parametric bias arising from the mismatch between economic discounting and
RL's treatment of intertemporal costs. To address both issues, we propose a
calibrated Mean-Field Reinforcement Learning framework that embeds a
representative agent in a fixed macroeconomic field and adjusts the cost
function to reflect economic opportunity costs. Our iterative algorithm
converges to a self-consistent fixed point where the agent's policy aligns with
the competitive equilibrium. This approach provides a tractable and
theoretically sound methodology for modeling learning agents in economic
systems within the broader domain of computational social science.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18229v1,,False
GenAI for Automotive Software Development: From Requirements to Wheels,24/07/2025,"Nenad Petrovic, Fengjunjie Pan, Vahid Zolfaghari, Krzysztof Lebioda, Andre Schamschurko, Alois Knoll","This paper introduces a GenAI-empowered approach to automated development of
automotive software, with emphasis on autonomous and Advanced Driver Assistance
Systems (ADAS) capabilities. The process starts with requirements as input,
while the main generated outputs are test scenario code for simulation
environment, together with implementation of desired ADAS capabilities
targeting hardware platform of the vehicle connected to testbench. Moreover, we
introduce additional steps for requirements consistency checking leveraging
Model-Driven Engineering (MDE). In the proposed workflow, Large Language Models
(LLMs) are used for model-based summarization of requirements (Ecore metamodel,
XMI model instance and OCL constraint creation), test scenario generation,
simulation code (Python) and target platform code generation (C++).
Additionally, Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is adopted to enhance test
scenario generation from autonomous driving regulations-related documents. Our
approach aims shorter compliance and re-engineering cycles, as well as reduced
development and testing time when it comes to ADAS-related capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.18223v1,,False
OpenNav: Open-World Navigation with Multimodal Large Language Models,24/07/2025,"Mingfeng Yuan, Letian Wang, Steven L. Waslander","Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
common-sense reasoning abilities, making them promising for robotic navigation
and planning tasks. However, despite recent progress, bridging the gap between
language descriptions and actual robot actions in the open-world, beyond merely
invoking limited predefined motion primitives, remains an open challenge. In
this work, we aim to enable robots to interpret and decompose complex language
instructions, ultimately synthesizing a sequence of trajectory points to
complete diverse navigation tasks given open-set instructions and open-set
objects. We observe that multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit
strong cross-modal understanding when processing free-form language
instructions, demonstrating robust scene comprehension. More importantly,
leveraging their code-generation capability, MLLMs can interact with
vision-language perception models to generate compositional 2D bird-eye-view
value maps, effectively integrating semantic knowledge from MLLMs with spatial
information from maps to reinforce the robot's spatial understanding. To
further validate our approach, we effectively leverage large-scale autonomous
vehicle datasets (AVDs) to validate our proposed zero-shot vision-language
navigation framework in outdoor navigation tasks, demonstrating its capability
to execute a diverse range of free-form natural language navigation
instructions while maintaining robustness against object detection errors and
linguistic ambiguities. Furthermore, we validate our system on a Husky robot in
both indoor and outdoor scenes, demonstrating its real-world robustness and
applicability. Supplementary videos are available at
