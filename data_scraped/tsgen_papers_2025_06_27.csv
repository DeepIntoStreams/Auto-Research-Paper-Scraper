WorldVLA: Towards Autoregressive Action World Model,26/06/2025,"Jun Cen, Chaohui Yu, Hangjie Yuan, Yuming Jiang, Siteng Huang, Jiayan Guo, Xin Li, Yibing Song, Hao Luo, Fan Wang, Deli Zhao, Hao Chen","We present WorldVLA, an autoregressive action world model that unifies action
and image understanding and generation. Our WorldVLA intergrates
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) model and world model in one single framework. The
world model predicts future images by leveraging both action and image
understanding, with the purpose of learning the underlying physics of the
environment to improve action generation. Meanwhile, the action model generates
the subsequent actions based on image observations, aiding in visual
understanding and in turn helps visual generation of the world model. We
demonstrate that WorldVLA outperforms standalone action and world models,
highlighting the mutual enhancement between the world model and the action
model. In addition, we find that the performance of the action model
deteriorates when generating sequences of actions in an autoregressive manner.
This phenomenon can be attributed to the model's limited generalization
capability for action prediction, leading to the propagation of errors from
earlier actions to subsequent ones. To address this issue, we propose an
attention mask strategy that selectively masks prior actions during the
generation of the current action, which shows significant performance
improvement in the action chunk generation task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21539v1,,False
Evaluation of Traffic Signals for Daily Traffic Pattern,26/06/2025,"Mohammad Shokrolah Shirazi, Hung-Fu Chang","The turning movement count data is crucial for traffic signal design,
intersection geometry planning, traffic flow, and congestion analysis. This
work proposes three methods called dynamic, static, and hybrid configuration
for TMC-based traffic signals. A vision-based tracking system is developed to
estimate the TMC of six intersections in Las Vegas using traffic cameras. The
intersection design, route (e.g. vehicle movement directions), and signal
configuration files with compatible formats are synthesized and imported into
Simulation of Urban MObility for signal evaluation with realistic data. The
initial experimental results based on estimated waiting times indicate that the
cycle time of 90 and 120 seconds works best for all intersections. In addition,
four intersections show better performance for dynamic signal timing
configuration, and the other two with lower performance have a lower ratio of
total vehicle count to total lanes of the intersection leg. Since daily traffic
flow often exhibits a bimodal pattern, we propose a hybrid signal method that
switches between dynamic and static methods, adapting to peak and off-peak
traffic conditions for improved flow management. So, a built-in traffic
generator module creates vehicle routes for 4 hours, including peak hours, and
a signal design module produces signal schedule cycles according to static,
dynamic, and hybrid methods. Vehicle count distributions are weighted
differently for each zone (i.e., West, North, East, South) to generate diverse
traffic patterns. The extended experimental results for 6 intersections with 4
hours of simulation time imply that zone-based traffic pattern distributions
affect signal design selection. Although the static method works great for
evenly zone-based traffic distribution, the hybrid method works well for highly
weighted traffic at intersection pairs of the West-East and North-South zones.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21469v1,,False
Spatial Mental Modeling from Limited Views,26/06/2025,"Baiqiao Yin, Qineng Wang, Pingyue Zhang, Jianshu Zhang, Kangrui Wang, Zihan Wang, Jieyu Zhang, Keshigeyan Chandrasegaran, Han Liu, Ranjay Krishna, Saining Xie, Manling Li, Jiajun Wu, Li Fei-Fei","Can Vision Language Models (VLMs) imagine the full scene from just a few
views, like humans do? Humans form spatial mental models, internal
representations of unseen space, to reason about layout, perspective, and
motion. Our new MindCube benchmark with 21,154 questions across 3,268 images
exposes this critical gap, where existing VLMs exhibit near-random performance.
Using MindCube, we systematically evaluate how well VLMs build robust spatial
mental models through representing positions (cognitive mapping), orientations
(perspective-taking), and dynamics (mental simulation for ""what-if"" movements).
We then explore three approaches to help VLMs approximate spatial mental
models, including unseen intermediate views, natural language reasoning chains,
and cognitive maps. The significant improvement comes from a synergistic
approach, ""map-then-reason"", that jointly trains the model to first generate a
cognitive map and then reason upon it. By training models to reason over these
internal maps, we boosted accuracy from 37.8% to 60.8% (+23.0%). Adding
reinforcement learning pushed performance even further to 70.7% (+32.9%). Our
key insight is that such scaffolding of spatial mental models, actively
constructing and utilizing internal structured spatial representations with
flexible reasoning processes, significantly improves understanding of
unobservable space.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21458v1,,False
Active Inference AI Systems for Scientific Discovery,26/06/2025,Karthik Duraisamy,"The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence has led to expectations of
transformative scientific discovery, yet current systems remain fundamentally
limited by their operational architectures, brittle reasoning mechanisms, and
their separation from experimental reality. Building on earlier work, we
contend that progress in AI-driven science now depends on closing three
fundamental gaps -- the abstraction gap, the reasoning gap, and the reality gap
-- rather than on model size/data/test time compute. Scientific reasoning
demands internal representations that support simulation of actions and
response, causal structures that distinguish correlation from mechanism, and
continuous calibration. We define active inference AI systems for scientific
discovery as those that (i) maintain long-lived research memories grounded in
causal self-supervised foundation models, (ii) symbolic or neuro-symbolic
planners equipped with Bayesian guardrails, (iii) grow persistent knowledge
graphs where thinking generates novel conceptual nodes, reasoning establishes
causal edges, and real-world interaction prunes false connections while
strengthening verified pathways, and (iv) refine their internal representations
through closed-loop interaction with both high-fidelity simulators and
automated laboratories - an operational loop where mental simulation guides
action and empirical surprise reshapes understanding. In essence, we outline an
architecture where discovery arises from the interplay between internal models
that enable counterfactual reasoning and external validation that grounds
hypotheses in reality. It is also argued that the inherent ambiguity in
feedback from simulations and experiments, and underlying uncertainties makes
human judgment indispensable, not as a temporary scaffold but as a permanent
architectural component.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21329v1,,False
Stochastic Quantum Spiking Neural Networks with Quantum Memory and Local Learning,26/06/2025,"Jiechen Chen, Bipin Rajendran, Osvaldo Simeone","Neuromorphic and quantum computing have recently emerged as promising
paradigms for advancing artificial intelligence, each offering complementary
strengths. Neuromorphic systems built on spiking neurons excel at processing
time-series data efficiently through sparse, event-driven computation,
consuming energy only upon input events. Quantum computing, on the other hand,
leverages superposition and entanglement to explore feature spaces that are
exponentially large in the number of qubits. Hybrid approaches combining these
paradigms have begun to show potential, but existing quantum spiking models
have important limitations. Notably, prior quantum spiking neuron
implementations rely on classical memory mechanisms on single qubits, requiring
repeated measurements to estimate firing probabilities, and they use
conventional backpropagation on classical simulators for training. Here we
propose a stochastic quantum spiking (SQS) neuron model that addresses these
challenges. The SQS neuron uses multi-qubit quantum circuits to realize a
spiking unit with internal quantum memory, enabling event-driven probabilistic
spike generation in a single shot. Furthermore, we outline how networks of SQS
neurons -- dubbed SQS neural networks (SQSNNs) -- can be trained via a
hardware-friendly local learning rule, eliminating the need for global
classical backpropagation. The proposed SQSNN model fuses the time-series
efficiency of neuromorphic computing with the exponentially large inner state
space of quantum computing, paving the way for quantum spiking neural networks
that are modular, scalable, and trainable on quantum hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21324v1,,False
BitMark for Infinity: Watermarking Bitwise Autoregressive Image Generative Models,26/06/2025,"Louis Kerner, Michel Meintz, Bihe Zhao, Franziska Boenisch, Adam Dziedzic","State-of-the-art text-to-image models like Infinity generate photorealistic
images at an unprecedented speed. These models operate in a bitwise
autoregressive manner over a discrete set of tokens that is practically
infinite in size. However, their impressive generative power comes with a
growing risk: as their outputs increasingly populate the Internet, they are
likely to be scraped and reused as training data-potentially by the very same
models. This phenomenon has been shown to lead to model collapse, where
repeated training on generated content, especially from the models' own
previous versions, causes a gradual degradation in performance. A promising
mitigation strategy is watermarking, which embeds human-imperceptible yet
detectable signals into generated images-enabling the identification of
generated content. In this work, we introduce BitMark, a robust bitwise
watermarking framework for Infinity. Our method embeds a watermark directly at
the bit level of the token stream across multiple scales (also referred to as
resolutions) during Infinity's image generation process. Our bitwise watermark
subtly influences the bits to preserve visual fidelity and generation speed
while remaining robust against a spectrum of removal techniques. Furthermore,
it exhibits high radioactivity, i.e., when watermarked generated images are
used to train another image generative model, this second model's outputs will
also carry the watermark. The radioactive traces remain detectable even when
only fine-tuning diffusion or image autoregressive models on images watermarked
with our BitMark. Overall, our approach provides a principled step toward
preventing model collapse in image generative models by enabling reliable
detection of generated outputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21209v1,,False
Diverse Mini-Batch Selection in Reinforcement Learning for Efficient Chemical Exploration in de novo Drug Design,26/06/2025,"Hampus Gummesson Svensson, Ola Engkvist, Jon Paul Janet, Christian Tyrchan, Morteza Haghir Chehreghani","In many real-world applications, evaluating the goodness of instances is
often costly and time-consuming, e.g., human feedback and physics simulations,
in contrast to proposing new instances. In particular, this is even more
critical in reinforcement learning, as new interactions with the environment
(i.e., new instances) need to be evaluated to provide a reward signal to learn
from. As sufficient exploration is crucial, learning from a diverse mini-batch
can have a large impact and help mitigate mode collapse. In this paper, we
introduce diverse mini-batch selection for reinforcement learning and propose
to use determinantal point processes for this task. We study this framework in
the context of a real-world problem, namely drug discovery. We experimentally
study how our proposed framework can improve the effectiveness of chemical
exploration in de novo drug design, where finding diverse and high-quality
solutions is essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation with three
well-established molecular generation oracles over numerous generative steps.
Our experiments conclude that our diverse mini-batch selection framework can
substantially improve the diversity of the solutions, while still obtaining
solutions of high quality. In drug discovery, such outcome can potentially lead
to fulfilling unmet medication needs faster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21158v1,,False
Transformer-Based Spatial-Temporal Counterfactual Outcomes Estimation,26/06/2025,"He Li, Haoang Chi, Mingyu Liu, Wanrong Huang, Liyang Xu, Wenjing Yang","The real world naturally has dimensions of time and space. Therefore,
estimating the counterfactual outcomes with spatial-temporal attributes is a
crucial problem. However, previous methods are based on classical statistical
models, which still have limitations in performance and generalization. This
paper proposes a novel framework for estimating counterfactual outcomes with
spatial-temporal attributes using the Transformer, exhibiting stronger
estimation ability. Under mild assumptions, the proposed estimator within this
framework is consistent and asymptotically normal. To validate the
effectiveness of our approach, we conduct simulation experiments and real data
experiments. Simulation experiments show that our estimator has a stronger
estimation capability than baseline methods. Real data experiments provide a
valuable conclusion to the causal effect of conflicts on forest loss in
Colombia. The source code is available at

Curriculum-Guided Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for Secure UAV Deconfliction under Observation-Space Attacks,26/06/2025,"Deepak Kumar Panda, Adolfo Perrusquia, Weisi Guo","Reinforcement learning (RL) policies deployed in safety-critical systems,
such as unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) navigation in dynamic airspace, are
vulnerable to out-ofdistribution (OOD) adversarial attacks in the observation
space. These attacks induce distributional shifts that significantly degrade
value estimation, leading to unsafe or suboptimal decision making rendering the
existing policy fragile. To address this vulnerability, we propose an
antifragile RL framework designed to adapt against curriculum of incremental
adversarial perturbations. The framework introduces a simulated attacker which
incrementally increases the strength of observation-space perturbations which
enables the RL agent to adapt and generalize across a wider range of OOD
observations and anticipate previously unseen attacks. We begin with a
theoretical characterization of fragility, formally defining catastrophic
forgetting as a monotonic divergence in value function distributions with
increasing perturbation strength. Building on this, we define antifragility as
the boundedness of such value shifts and derive adaptation conditions under
which forgetting is stabilized. Our method enforces these bounds through
iterative expert-guided critic alignment using Wasserstein distance
minimization across incrementally perturbed observations. We empirically
evaluate the approach in a UAV deconfliction scenario involving dynamic 3D
obstacles. Results show that the antifragile policy consistently outperforms
standard and robust RL baselines when subjected to both projected gradient
descent (PGD) and GPS spoofing attacks, achieving up to 15% higher cumulative
reward and over 30% fewer conflict events. These findings demonstrate the
practical and theoretical viability of antifragile reinforcement learning for
secure and resilient decision-making in environments with evolving threat
scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21129v1,,False
Robust Policy Switching for Antifragile Reinforcement Learning for UAV Deconfliction in Adversarial Environments,26/06/2025,"Deepak Kumar Panda, Weisi Guo","The increasing automation of navigation for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
has exposed them to adversarial attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in
reinforcement learning (RL) through sensor manipulation. Although existing
robust RL methods aim to mitigate such threats, their effectiveness has limited
generalization to out-of-distribution shifts from the optimal value
distribution, as they are primarily designed to handle fixed perturbation. To
address this limitation, this paper introduces an antifragile RL framework that
enhances adaptability to broader distributional shifts by incorporating a
switching mechanism based on discounted Thompson sampling (DTS). This mechanism
dynamically selects among multiple robust policies to minimize adversarially
induced state-action-value distribution shifts. The proposed approach first
derives a diverse ensemble of action robust policies by accounting for a range
of perturbations in the policy space. These policies are then modeled as a
multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, where DTS optimally selects policies in
response to nonstationary Bernoulli rewards, effectively adapting to evolving
adversarial strategies. Theoretical framework has also been provided where by
optimizing the DTS to minimize the overall regrets due to distributional shift,
results in effective adaptation against unseen adversarial attacks thus
inducing antifragility. Extensive numerical simulations validate the
effectiveness of the proposed framework in complex navigation environments with
multiple dynamic three-dimensional obstacles and with stronger projected
gradient descent (PGD) and spoofing attacks. Compared to conventional robust,
non-adaptive RL methods, the antifragile approach achieves superior
performance, demonstrating shorter navigation path lengths and a higher rate of
conflict-free navigation trajectories compared to existing robust RL techniques",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21127v1,,False
Unlasting: Unpaired Single-Cell Multi-Perturbation Estimation by Dual Conditional Diffusion Implicit Bridges,26/06/2025,"Changxi Chi, Jun Xia, Yufei Huang, Jingbo Zhou, Siyuan Li, Yunfan Liu, Chang Yu, Stan Z. Li","Estimating single-cell responses across various perturbations facilitates the
identification of key genes and enhances drug screening, significantly boosting
experimental efficiency. However, single-cell sequencing is a destructive
process, making it impossible to capture the same cell's phenotype before and
after perturbation. Consequently, data collected under perturbed and
unperturbed conditions are inherently unpaired. Existing methods either attempt
to forcibly pair unpaired data using random sampling, or neglect the inherent
relationship between unperturbed and perturbed cells during the modeling. In
this work, we propose a framework based on Dual Diffusion Implicit Bridges
(DDIB) to learn the mapping between different data distributions, effectively
addressing the challenge of unpaired data. We further interpret this framework
as a form of data augmentation. We integrate gene regulatory network (GRN)
information to propagate perturbation signals in a biologically meaningful way,
and further incorporate a masking mechanism to predict silent genes, improving
the quality of generated profiles. Moreover, gene expression under the same
perturbation often varies significantly across cells, frequently exhibiting a
bimodal distribution that reflects intrinsic heterogeneity. To capture this, we
introduce a more suitable evaluation metric. We propose Unlasting, dual
conditional diffusion models that overcome the problem of unpaired single-cell
perturbation data and strengthen the model's insight into perturbations under
the guidance of the GRN, with a dedicated mask model designed to improve
generation quality by predicting silent genes. In addition, we introduce a
biologically grounded evaluation metric that better reflects the inherent
heterogeneity in single-cell responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21107v1,,False
V2X-REALM: Vision-Language Model-Based Robust End-to-End Cooperative Autonomous Driving with Adaptive Long-Tail Modeling,26/06/2025,"Junwei You, Pei Li, Zhuoyu Jiang, Zilin Huang, Rui Gan, Haotian Shi, Bin Ran","Ensuring robust planning and decision-making under rare, diverse, and
visually degraded long-tail scenarios remains a fundamental challenge for
autonomous driving in urban environments. This issue becomes more critical in
cooperative settings, where vehicles and infrastructure jointly perceive and
reason across complex environments. To address this challenge, we propose
V2X-REALM, a vision-language model (VLM)-based framework with adaptive
multimodal learning for robust cooperative autonomous driving under long-tail
scenarios. V2X-REALM introduces three core innovations: (i) a prompt-driven
long-tail scenario generation and evaluation pipeline that leverages foundation
models to synthesize realistic long-tail conditions such as snow and fog across
vehicle- and infrastructure-side views, enriching training diversity
efficiently; (ii) a gated multi-scenario adaptive attention module that
modulates the visual stream using scenario priors to recalibrate ambiguous or
corrupted features; and (iii) a multi-task scenario-aware contrastive learning
objective that improves multimodal alignment and promotes cross-scenario
feature separability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that V2X-REALM
significantly outperforms existing baselines in robustness, semantic reasoning,
safety, and planning accuracy under complex, challenging driving conditions,
advancing the scalability of end-to-end cooperative autonomous driving.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21041v1,,False
An Information-Theoretic Analysis for Federated Learning under Concept Drift,26/06/2025,"Fu Peng, Meng Zhang, Ming Tang","Recent studies in federated learning (FL) commonly train models on static
datasets. However, real-world data often arrives as streams with shifting
distributions, causing performance degradation known as concept drift. This
paper analyzes FL performance under concept drift using information theory and
proposes an algorithm to mitigate the performance degradation. We model concept
drift as a Markov chain and introduce the \emph{Stationary Generalization
Error} to assess a model's capability to capture characteristics of future
unseen data. Its upper bound is derived using KL divergence and mutual
information. We study three drift patterns (periodic, gradual, and random) and
their impact on FL performance. Inspired by this, we propose an algorithm that
regularizes the empirical risk minimization approach with KL divergence and
mutual information, thereby enhancing long-term performance. We also explore
the performance-cost tradeoff by identifying a Pareto front. To validate our
approach, we build an FL testbed using Raspberry Pi4 devices. Experimental
results corroborate with theoretical findings, confirming that drift patterns
significantly affect performance. Our method consistently outperforms existing
approaches for these three patterns, demonstrating its effectiveness in
adapting concept drift in FL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21036v1,,False
Can Gradient Descent Simulate Prompting?,26/06/2025,"Eric Zhang, Leshem Choshen, Jacob Andreas","There are two primary ways of incorporating new information into a language
model (LM): changing its prompt or changing its parameters, e.g. via
fine-tuning. Parameter updates incur no long-term storage cost for model
changes. However, for many model updates, prompting is significantly more
effective: prompted models can generalize robustly from single examples and
draw logical inferences that do not occur under standard fine-tuning. Can
models be modified so that fine-tuning does emulate prompting? This paper
describes a method for meta-training LMs such that gradient updates emulate the
effects of conditioning on new information. Our approach uses tools from
gradient-based meta-learning but uses an LM's own prompted predictions as
targets, eliminating the need for ground-truth labels. Subsequent gradient
descent training recovers some (and occasionally all) of prompted model
performance -- showing improvement on the ``reversal curse'' tasks, and
answering questions about text passages after a single gradient update. These
results suggest that, with appropriate initialization, gradient descent can be
surprisingly expressive. Our results suggest new avenues for long-context
modeling and offer insight into the generalization capabilities of
gradient-based learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20989v1,,False
Antibody Design and Optimization with Multi-scale Equivariant Graph Diffusion Models for Accurate Complex Antigen Binding,26/06/2025,"Jiameng Chen, Xiantao Cai, Jia Wu, Wenbin Hu","Antibody design remains a critical challenge in therapeutic and diagnostic
development, particularly for complex antigens with diverse binding interfaces.
Current computational methods face two main limitations: (1) capturing
geometric features while preserving symmetries, and (2) generalizing novel
antigen interfaces. Despite recent advancements, these methods often fail to
accurately capture molecular interactions and maintain structural integrity. To
address these challenges, we propose \textbf{AbMEGD}, an end-to-end framework
integrating \textbf{M}ulti-scale \textbf{E}quivariant \textbf{G}raph
\textbf{D}iffusion for antibody sequence and structure co-design. Leveraging
advanced geometric deep learning, AbMEGD combines atomic-level geometric
features with residue-level embeddings, capturing local atomic details and
global sequence-structure interactions. Its E(3)-equivariant diffusion method
ensures geometric precision, computational efficiency, and robust
generalizability for complex antigens. Furthermore, experiments using the
SAbDab database demonstrate a 10.13\% increase in amino acid recovery, 3.32\%
rise in improvement percentage, and a 0.062~\AA\ reduction in root mean square
deviation within the critical CDR-H3 region compared to DiffAb, a leading
antibody design model. These results highlight AbMEGD's ability to balance
structural integrity with improved functionality, establishing a new benchmark
for sequence-structure co-design and affinity optimization. The code is

Beyond Reactive Safety: Risk-Aware LLM Alignment via Long-Horizon Simulation,26/06/2025,"Chenkai Sun, Denghui Zhang, ChengXiang Zhai, Heng Ji","Given the growing influence of language model-based agents on high-stakes
societal decisions, from public policy to healthcare, ensuring their beneficial
impact requires understanding the far-reaching implications of their
suggestions. We propose a proof-of-concept framework that projects how
model-generated advice could propagate through societal systems on a
macroscopic scale over time, enabling more robust alignment. To assess the
long-term safety awareness of language models, we also introduce a dataset of
100 indirect harm scenarios, testing models' ability to foresee adverse,
non-obvious outcomes from seemingly harmless user prompts. Our approach
achieves not only over 20% improvement on the new dataset but also an average
win rate exceeding 70% against strong baselines on existing safety benchmarks

LLM-guided Chemical Process Optimization with a Multi-Agent Approach,26/06/2025,"Tong Zeng, Srivathsan Badrinarayanan, Janghoon Ock, Cheng-Kai Lai, Amir Barati Farimani","Chemical process optimization is crucial to maximize production efficiency
and economic performance. Traditional methods, including gradient-based
solvers, evolutionary algorithms, and parameter grid searches, become
impractical when operating constraints are ill-defined or unavailable,
requiring engineers to rely on subjective heuristics to estimate feasible
parameter ranges. To address this constraint definition bottleneck, we present
a multi-agent framework of large language model (LLM) agents that autonomously
infer operating constraints from minimal process descriptions, then
collaboratively guide optimization using the inferred constraints. Our
AutoGen-based agentic framework employs OpenAI's o3 model, with specialized
agents for constraint generation, parameter validation, simulation execution,
and optimization guidance. Through two phases - autonomous constraint
generation using embedded domain knowledge, followed by iterative multi-agent
optimization - the framework eliminates the need for predefined operational
bounds. Validated on the hydrodealkylation process across cost, yield, and
yield-to-cost ratio metrics, the framework demonstrated competitive performance
with conventional optimization methods while achieving better computational
efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to converge. Our approach converged in
under 20 minutes, achieving a 31-fold speedup over grid search. Beyond
computational efficiency, the framework's reasoning-guided search demonstrates
sophisticated process understanding, correctly identifying utility trade-offs,
and applying domain-informed heuristics. This approach shows significant
potential for optimization scenarios where operational constraints are poorly
characterized or unavailable, particularly for emerging processes and retrofit
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20921v1,,False
