Hiding Local Manipulations on SAR Images: a Counter-Forensic Attack,09/07/2024,"Sara Mandelli, Edoardo Daniele Cannas, Paolo Bestagini, Stefano Tebaldini, Stefano Tubaro","The vast accessibility of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images through
online portals has propelled the research across various fields. This
widespread use and easy availability have unfortunately made SAR data
susceptible to malicious alterations, such as local editing applied to the
images for inserting or covering the presence of sensitive targets.
Vulnerability is further emphasized by the fact that most SAR products, despite
their original complex nature, are often released as amplitude-only
information, allowing even inexperienced attackers to edit and easily alter the
pixel content. To contrast malicious manipulations, in the last years the
forensic community has begun to dig into the SAR manipulation issue, proposing
detectors that effectively localize the tampering traces in amplitude images.
Nonetheless, in this paper we demonstrate that an expert practitioner can
exploit the complex nature of SAR data to obscure any signs of manipulation
within a locally altered amplitude image. We refer to this approach as a
counter-forensic attack. To achieve the concealment of manipulation traces, the
attacker can simulate a re-acquisition of the manipulated scene by the SAR
system that initially generated the pristine image. In doing so, the attacker
can obscure any evidence of manipulation, making it appear as if the image was
legitimately produced by the system. We assess the effectiveness of the
proposed counter-forensic approach across diverse scenarios, examining various
manipulation operations. The obtained results indicate that our devised attack
successfully eliminates traces of manipulation, deceiving even the most
advanced forensic detectors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07041v1,,False
Aligning Cyber Space with Physical World: A Comprehensive Survey on Embodied AI,09/07/2024,"Yang Liu, Weixing Chen, Yongjie Bai, Jingzhou Luo, Xinshuai Song, Kaixuan Jiang, Zhida Li, Ganlong Zhao, Junyi Lin, Guanbin Li, Wen Gao, Liang Lin","Embodied Artificial Intelligence (Embodied AI) is crucial for achieving
Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and serves as a foundation for various
applications that bridge cyberspace and the physical world. Recently, the
emergence of Multi-modal Large Models (MLMs) and World Models (WMs) have
attracted significant attention due to their remarkable perception,
interaction, and reasoning capabilities, making them a promising architecture
for the brain of embodied agents. However, there is no comprehensive survey for
Embodied AI in the era of MLMs. In this survey, we give a comprehensive
exploration of the latest advancements in Embodied AI. Our analysis firstly
navigates through the forefront of representative works of embodied robots and
simulators, to fully understand the research focuses and their limitations.
Then, we analyze four main research targets: 1) embodied perception, 2)
embodied interaction, 3) embodied agent, and 4) sim-to-real adaptation,
covering the state-of-the-art methods, essential paradigms, and comprehensive
datasets. Additionally, we explore the complexities of MLMs in virtual and real
embodied agents, highlighting their significance in facilitating interactions
in dynamic digital and physical environments. Finally, we summarize the
challenges and limitations of embodied AI and discuss their potential future
directions. We hope this survey will serve as a foundational reference for the
research community and inspire continued innovation. The associated project can

TeVAE: A Variational Autoencoder Approach for Discrete Online Anomaly Detection in Variable-state Multivariate Time-series Data,09/07/2024,"Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Philipp Klein, Thomas BÃ¤ck, Anna V. Kononova","As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and
manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic
online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and
requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a
temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal
false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the
bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a
continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the
detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results
from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured,
TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies
present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and
validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation
method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06849v1,,False
It's Our Loss: No Privacy Amplification for Hidden State DP-SGD With Non-Convex Loss,09/07/2024,Meenatchi Sundaram Muthu Selva Annamalai,"Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD) is a popular
iterative algorithm used to train machine learning models while formally
guaranteeing the privacy of users. However the privacy analysis of DP-SGD makes
the unrealistic assumption that all intermediate iterates (aka internal state)
of the algorithm are released since in practice, only the final trained model,
i.e., the final iterate of the algorithm is released. In this hidden state
setting, prior work has provided tighter analyses, albeit only when the loss
function is constrained, e.g., strongly convex and smooth or linear. On the
other hand, the privacy leakage observed empirically from hidden state DP-SGD,
even when using non-convex loss functions suggest that there is in fact a gap
between the theoretical privacy analysis and the privacy guarantees achieved in
practice. Therefore, it remains an open question whether privacy amplification
for DP-SGD is possible in the hidden state setting for general loss functions.
  Unfortunately, this work answers the aforementioned research question
negatively. By carefully constructing a loss function for DP-SGD, we show that
for specific loss functions, the final iterate of DP-SGD alone leaks as much
information as the sequence of all iterates combined. Furthermore, we
empirically verify this result by evaluating the privacy leakage from the final
iterate of DP-SGD with our loss function and show that this matches the
theoretical upper bound guaranteed by DP exactly. Therefore, we show that the
current privacy analysis fo DP-SGD is tight for general loss functions and
conclude that no privacy amplification is possible for DP-SGD in general for
all (possibly non-convex) loss functions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06496v1,,False
A Generative Approach to Control Complex Physical Systems,09/07/2024,"Long Wei, Peiyan Hu, Ruiqi Feng, Haodong Feng, Yixuan Du, Tao Zhang, Rui Wang, Yue Wang, Zhi-Ming Ma, Tailin Wu","Controlling the evolution of complex physical systems is a fundamental task
across science and engineering. Classical techniques suffer from limited
applicability or huge computational costs. On the other hand, recent deep
learning and reinforcement learning-based approaches often struggle to optimize
long-term control sequences under the constraints of system dynamics. In this
work, we introduce Diffusion Physical systems Control (DiffPhyCon), a new class
of method to address the physical systems control problem. DiffPhyCon excels by
simultaneously minimizing both the learned generative energy function and the
predefined control objectives across the entire trajectory and control
sequence. Thus, it can explore globally and identify near-optimal control
sequences. Moreover, we enhance DiffPhyCon with prior reweighting, enabling the
discovery of control sequences that significantly deviate from the training
distribution. We test our method in 1D Burgers' equation and 2D jellyfish
movement control in a fluid environment. Our method outperforms widely applied
classical approaches and state-of-the-art deep learning and reinforcement
learning methods. Notably, DiffPhyCon unveils an intriguing
fast-close-slow-open pattern observed in the jellyfish, aligning with
established findings in the field of fluid dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06494v1,,False
