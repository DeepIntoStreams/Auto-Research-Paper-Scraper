Open RAN-Enabled Deep Learning-Assisted Mobility Management for Connected Vehicles,30/12/2024,"Maria Barbosa, Kelvin Dias","Connected Vehicles (CVs) can leverage the unique features of 5G and future
6G/NextG networks to enhance Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) services.
However, even with advancements in cellular network generations, CV
applications may experience communication interruptions in high-mobility
scenarios due to frequent changes of serving base station, also known as
handovers (HOs). This paper proposes the adoption of Open Radio Access Network
(Open RAN/O-RAN) and deep learning models for decision-making to prevent
Quality of Service (QoS) degradation due to HOs and to ensure the timely
connectivity needed for CV services. The solution utilizes the O-RAN Software
Community (OSC), an open-source O-RAN platform developed by the collaboration
between the O-RAN Alliance and Linux Foundation, to develop xApps that are
executed in the near-Real-Time RIC of OSC. To demonstrate the proposal's
effectiveness, an integrated framework combining the OMNeT++ simulator and OSC
was created. Evaluations used real-world datasets in urban application
scenarios, such as video streaming transmission and over-the-air (OTA) updates.
Results indicate that the proposal achieved superior performance and reduced
latency compared to the standard 3GPP HO procedure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21161v1,,False
Exploring and Controlling Diversity in LLM-Agent Conversation,30/12/2024,"KuanChao Chu, Yi-Pei Chen, Hideki Nakayama","Diversity is a critical aspect of multi-agent communication. In this paper,
we focus on controlling and exploring diversity in the context of open-domain
multi-agent conversations, particularly for world simulation applications. We
propose Adaptive Prompt Pruning (APP), a novel method that dynamically adjusts
the content of the utterance generation prompt to control diversity using a
single parameter, lambda. Through extensive experiments, we show that APP
effectively controls the output diversity across models and datasets, with
pruning more information leading to more diverse output. We comprehensively
analyze the relationship between prompt content and conversational diversity.
Our findings reveal that information from all components of the prompt
generally constrains the diversity of the output, with the Memory block
exerting the most significant influence. APP is compatible with established
techniques like temperature sampling and top-p sampling, providing a versatile
tool for diversity management. To address the trade-offs of increased
diversity, such as inconsistencies with omitted information, we incorporate a
post-generation correction step, which effectively balances diversity
enhancement with output consistency. Additionally, we examine how prompt
structure, including component order and length, impacts diversity. This study
addresses key questions surrounding diversity in multi-agent world simulation,
offering insights into its control, influencing factors, and associated
trade-offs. Our contributions lay the foundation for systematically engineering
diversity in LLM-based multi-agent collaborations, advancing their
effectiveness in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21102v1,,False
Weber-Fechner Law in Temporal Difference learning derived from Control as Inference,30/12/2024,"Keiichiro Takahashi, Taisuke Kobayashi, Tomoya Yamanokuchi, Takamitsu Matsubara","This paper investigates a novel nonlinear update rule based on temporal
difference (TD) errors in reinforcement learning (RL). The update rule in the
standard RL states that the TD error is linearly proportional to the degree of
updates, treating all rewards equally without no bias. On the other hand, the
recent biological studies revealed that there are nonlinearities in the TD
error and the degree of updates, biasing policies optimistic or pessimistic.
Such biases in learning due to nonlinearities are expected to be useful and
intentionally leftover features in biological learning. Therefore, this
research explores a theoretical framework that can leverage the nonlinearity
between the degree of the update and TD errors. To this end, we focus on a
control as inference framework, since it is known as a generalized formulation
encompassing various RL and optimal control methods. In particular, we
investigate the uncomputable nonlinear term needed to be approximately excluded
in the derivation of the standard RL from control as inference. By analyzing
it, Weber-Fechner law (WFL) is found, namely, perception (a.k.a. the degree of
updates) in response to stimulus change (a.k.a. TD error) is attenuated by
increase in the stimulus intensity (a.k.a. the value function). To numerically
reveal the utilities of WFL on RL, we then propose a practical implementation
using a reward-punishment framework and modifying the definition of optimality.
Analysis of this implementation reveals that two utilities can be expected i)
to increase rewards to a certain level early, and ii) to sufficiently suppress
punishment. We finally investigate and discuss the expected utilities through
simulations and robot experiments. As a result, the proposed RL algorithm with
WFL shows the expected utilities that accelerate the reward-maximizing startup
and continue to suppress punishments during learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.21004v1,,False
AlignAb: Pareto-Optimal Energy Alignment for Designing Nature-Like Antibodies,30/12/2024,"Yibo Wen, Chenwei Xu, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Han Liu","We present a three-stage framework for training deep learning models
specializing in antibody sequence-structure co-design. We first pre-train a
language model using millions of antibody sequence data. Then, we employ the
learned representations to guide the training of a diffusion model for joint
optimization over both sequence and structure of antibodies. During the final
alignment stage, we optimize the model to favor antibodies with low repulsion
and high attraction to the antigen binding site, enhancing the rationality and
functionality of the designs. To mitigate conflicting energy preferences, we
extend AbDPO (Antibody Direct Preference Optimization) to guide the model
towards Pareto optimality under multiple energy-based alignment objectives.
Furthermore, we adopt an iterative learning paradigm with temperature scaling,
enabling the model to benefit from diverse online datasets without requiring
additional data. In practice, our proposed methods achieve high stability and
efficiency in producing a better Pareto front of antibody designs compared to
top samples generated by baselines and previous alignment techniques. Through
extensive experiments, we showcase the superior performance of our methods in
generating nature-like antibodies with high binding affinity consistently.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20984v1,,False
Generalizing in Net-Zero Microgrids: A Study with Federated PPO and TRPO,30/12/2024,"Nicolas M Cuadrado Avila, Samuel Horváth, Martin Takáč","This work addresses the challenge of optimal energy management in microgrids
through a collaborative and privacy-preserving framework. We propose the
FedTRPO methodology, which integrates Federated Learning (FL) and Trust Region
Policy Optimization (TRPO) to manage distributed energy resources (DERs)
efficiently. Using a customized version of the CityLearn environment and
synthetically generated data, we simulate designed net-zero energy scenarios
for microgrids composed of multiple buildings. Our approach emphasizes reducing
energy costs and carbon emissions while ensuring privacy. Experimental results
demonstrate that FedTRPO is comparable with state-of-the-art federated RL
methodologies without hyperparameter tunning. The proposed framework highlights
the feasibility of collaborative learning for achieving optimal control
policies in energy systems, advancing the goals of sustainable and efficient
smart grids.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20946v1,,False
WalkVLM:Aid Visually Impaired People Walking by Vision Language Model,30/12/2024,"Zhiqiang Yuan, Ting Zhang, Jiapei Zhang, Jie Zhou, Jinchao Zhang","Approximately 200 million individuals around the world suffer from varying
degrees of visual impairment, making it crucial to leverage AI technology to
offer walking assistance for these people. With the recent progress of
vision-language models (VLMs), employing VLMs to improve this field has emerged
as a popular research topic. However, most existing methods are studied on
self-built question-answering datasets, lacking a unified training and testing
benchmark for walk guidance. Moreover, in blind walking task, it is necessary
to perform real-time streaming video parsing and generate concise yet
informative reminders, which poses a great challenge for VLMs that suffer from
redundant responses and low inference efficiency. In this paper, we firstly
release a diverse, extensive, and unbiased walking awareness dataset,
containing 12k video-manual annotation pairs from Europe and Asia to provide a
fair training and testing benchmark for blind walking task. Furthermore, a
WalkVLM model is proposed, which employs chain of thought for hierarchical
planning to generate concise but informative reminders and utilizes
temporal-aware adaptive prediction to reduce the temporal redundancy of
reminders. Finally, we have established a solid benchmark for blind walking
task and verified the advantages of WalkVLM in stream video processing for this
task compared to other VLMs. Our dataset and code will be released at anonymous

Acquisition-Independent Deep Learning for Quantitative MRI Parameter Estimation using Neural Controlled Differential Equations,30/12/2024,"Daan Kuppens, Sebastiano Barbieri, Daisy van den Berg, Pepijn Schouten, Harriet C. Thoeny, Myrte Wennen, Oliver J. Gurney-Champion","Deep learning has proven to be a suitable alternative to least-squares (LSQ)
fitting for parameter estimation in various quantitative MRI (QMRI) models.
However, current deep learning implementations are not robust to changes in MR
acquisition protocols. In practice, QMRI acquisition protocols differ
substantially between different studies and clinical settings. The lack of
generalizability and adoptability of current deep learning approaches for QMRI
parameter estimation impedes the implementation of these algorithms in clinical
trials and clinical practice. Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
allow for the sampling of incomplete and irregularly sampled data with variable
length, making them ideal for use in QMRI parameter estimation. In this study,
we show that NCDEs can function as a generic tool for the accurate prediction
of QMRI parameters, regardless of QMRI sequence length, configuration of
independent variables and QMRI forward model (variable flip angle T1-mapping,
intravoxel incoherent motion MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI). NCDEs
achieved lower mean squared error than LSQ fitting in low-SNR simulations and
in vivo in challenging anatomical regions like the abdomen and leg, but this
improvement was no longer evident at high SNR. NCDEs reduce estimation error
interquartile range without increasing bias, particularly under conditions of
high uncertainty. These findings suggest that NCDEs offer a robust approach for
reliable QMRI parameter estimation, especially in scenarios with high
uncertainty or low image quality. We believe that with NCDEs, we have solved
one of the main challenges for using deep learning for QMRI parameter
estimation in a broader clinical and research setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20844v1,,False
TimeRAF: Retrieval-Augmented Foundation model for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting,30/12/2024,"Huanyu Zhang, Chang Xu, Yi-Fan Zhang, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Jiang Bian, Tieniu Tan","Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in data mining, driving rapid
advancements across numerous industries. With the emergence of large models,
time series foundation models (TSFMs) have exhibited remarkable generalization
capabilities, such as zero-shot learning, through large-scale pre-training.
Meanwhile, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods have been widely
employed to enhance the performance of foundation models on unseen data,
allowing models to access to external knowledge. In this paper, we introduce
TimeRAF, a Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhance zero-shot time
series forecasting through retrieval-augmented techniques. We develop
customized time series knowledge bases that are tailored to the specific
forecasting tasks. TimeRAF employs an end-to-end learnable retriever to extract
valuable information from the knowledge base. Additionally, we propose Channel
Prompting for knowledge integration, which effectively extracts relevant
information from the retrieved knowledge along the channel dimension. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, showing significant
improvement across various domains and datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20810v1,,False
FastCHGNet: Training one Universal Interatomic Potential to 1.5 Hours with 32 GPUs,30/12/2024,"Yuanchang Zhou, Siyu Hu, Chen Wang, Lin-Wang Wang, Guangming Tan, Weile Jia","Graph neural network universal interatomic potentials (GNN-UIPs) have
demonstrated remarkable generalization and transfer capabilities in material
discovery and property prediction. These models can accelerate molecular
dynamics (MD) simulation by several orders of magnitude while maintaining
\textit{ab initio} accuracy, making them a promising new paradigm in material
simulations. One notable example is Crystal Hamiltonian Graph Neural Network
(CHGNet), pretrained on the energies, forces, stresses, and magnetic moments
from the MPtrj dataset, representing a state-of-the-art GNN-UIP model for
charge-informed MD simulations. However, training the CHGNet model is
time-consuming(8.3 days on one A100 GPU) for three reasons: (i) requiring
multi-layer propagation to reach more distant atom information, (ii) requiring
second-order derivatives calculation to finish weights updating and (iii) the
implementation of reference CHGNet does not fully leverage the computational
capabilities. This paper introduces FastCHGNet, an optimized CHGNet, with three
contributions: Firstly, we design innovative Force/Stress Readout modules to
decompose Force/Stress prediction. Secondly, we adopt massive optimizations
such as kernel fusion, redundancy bypass, etc, to exploit GPU computation power
sufficiently. Finally, we extend CHGNet to support multiple GPUs and propose a
load-balancing technique to enhance GPU utilization. Numerical results show
that FastCHGNet reduces memory footprint by a factor of 3.59. The final
training time of FastCHGNet can be decreased to \textbf{1.53 hours} on 32 GPUs
without sacrificing model accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20796v1,,False
Frequency-Masked Embedding Inference: A Non-Contrastive Approach for Time Series Representation Learning,30/12/2024,"En Fu, Yanyan Hu","Contrastive learning underpins most current self-supervised time series
representation methods. The strategy for constructing positive and negative
sample pairs significantly affects the final representation quality. However,
due to the continuous nature of time series semantics, the modeling approach of
contrastive learning struggles to accommodate the characteristics of time
series data. This results in issues such as difficulties in constructing hard
negative samples and the potential introduction of inappropriate biases during
positive sample construction. Although some recent works have developed several
scientific strategies for constructing positive and negative sample pairs with
improved effectiveness, they remain constrained by the contrastive learning
framework. To fundamentally overcome the limitations of contrastive learning,
this paper introduces Frequency-masked Embedding Inference (FEI), a novel
non-contrastive method that completely eliminates the need for positive and
negative samples. The proposed FEI constructs 2 inference branches based on a
prompting strategy: 1) Using frequency masking as prompts to infer the
embedding representation of the target series with missing frequency bands in
the embedding space, and 2) Using the target series as prompts to infer its
frequency masking embedding. In this way, FEI enables continuous semantic
relationship modeling for time series. Experiments on 8 widely used time series
datasets for classification and regression tasks, using linear evaluation and
end-to-end fine-tuning, show that FEI significantly outperforms existing
contrastive-based methods in terms of generalization. This study provides new
insights into self-supervised representation learning for time series. The code

Towards nation-wide analytical healthcare infrastructures: A privacy-preserving augmented knee rehabilitation case study,30/12/2024,"Boris Bačić, Claudiu Vasile, Chengwei Feng, Marian G. Ciucă","The purpose of this paper is to contribute towards the near-future
privacy-preserving big data analytical healthcare platforms, capable of
processing streamed or uploaded timeseries data or videos from patients. The
experimental work includes a real-life knee rehabilitation video dataset
capturing a set of exercises from simple and personalised to more general and
challenging movements aimed for returning to sport. To convert video from
mobile into privacy-preserving diagnostic timeseries data, we employed Google
MediaPipe pose estimation. The developed proof-of-concept algorithms can
augment knee exercise videos by overlaying the patient with stick figure
elements while updating generated timeseries plot with knee angle estimation
streamed as CSV file format. For patients and physiotherapists, video with
side-to-side timeseries visually indicating potential issues such as excessive
knee flexion or unstable knee movements or stick figure overlay errors is
possible by setting a-priori knee-angle parameters. To address adherence to
rehabilitation programme and quantify exercise sets and repetitions, our
adaptive algorithm can correctly identify (91.67%-100%) of all exercises from
side- and front-view videos. Transparent algorithm design for adaptive visual
analysis of various knee exercise patterns contributes towards the
interpretable AI and will inform near-future privacy-preserving, non-vendor
locking, open-source developments for both end-user computing devices and as
on-premises non-proprietary cloud platforms that can be deployed within the
national healthcare system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.20733v1,,False
