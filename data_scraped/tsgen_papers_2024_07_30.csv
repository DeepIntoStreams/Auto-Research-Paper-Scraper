Time series forecasting with high stakes: A field study of the air cargo industry,29/07/2024,"Abhinav Garg, Naman Shukla","Time series forecasting in the air cargo industry presents unique challenges
due to volatile market dynamics and the significant impact of accurate
forecasts on generated revenue. This paper explores a comprehensive approach to
demand forecasting at the origin-destination (O\&D) level, focusing on the
development and implementation of machine learning models in decision-making
for the air cargo industry. We leverage a mixture of experts framework,
combining statistical and advanced deep learning models to provide reliable
forecasts for cargo demand over a six-month horizon. The results demonstrate
that our approach outperforms industry benchmarks, offering actionable insights
for cargo capacity allocation and strategic decision-making in the air cargo
industry. While this work is applied in the airline industry, the methodology
is broadly applicable to any field where forecast-based decision-making in a
volatile environment is crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20192v1,,False
Language-Conditioned Offline RL for Multi-Robot Navigation,29/07/2024,"Steven Morad, Ajay Shankar, Jan Blumenkamp, Amanda Prorok","We present a method for developing navigation policies for multi-robot teams
that interpret and follow natural language instructions. We condition these
policies on embeddings from pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs), and train
them via offline reinforcement learning with as little as 20 minutes of
randomly-collected data. Experiments on a team of five real robots show that
these policies generalize well to unseen commands, indicating an understanding
of the LLM latent space. Our method requires no simulators or environment
models, and produces low-latency control policies that can be deployed directly
to real robots without finetuning. We provide videos of our experiments at

Aero-Nef: Neural Fields for Rapid Aircraft Aerodynamics Simulations,29/07/2024,"Giovanni Catalani, Siddhant Agarwal, Xavier Bertrand, Frederic Tost, Michael Bauerheim, Joseph Morlier","This paper presents a methodology to learn surrogate models of steady state
fluid dynamics simulations on meshed domains, based on Implicit Neural
Representations (INRs). The proposed models can be applied directly to
unstructured domains for different flow conditions, handle non-parametric 3D
geometric variations, and generalize to unseen shapes at test time. The
coordinate-based formulation naturally leads to robustness with respect to
discretization, allowing an excellent trade-off between computational cost
(memory footprint and training time) and accuracy. The method is demonstrated
on two industrially relevant applications: a RANS dataset of the
two-dimensional compressible flow over a transonic airfoil and a dataset of the
surface pressure distribution over 3D wings, including shape, inflow condition,
and control surface deflection variations. On the considered test cases, our
approach achieves a more than three times lower test error and significantly
improves generalization error on unseen geometries compared to state-of-the-art
Graph Neural Network architectures. Remarkably, the method can perform
inference five order of magnitude faster than the high fidelity solver on the
RANS transonic airfoil dataset. Code is available at

Imitation Learning for Intra-Day Power Grid Operation through Topology Actions,29/07/2024,"Matthijs de Jong, Jan Viebahn, Yuliya Shapovalova","Power grid operation is becoming increasingly complex due to the increase in
generation of renewable energy. The recent series of Learning To Run a Power
Network (L2RPN) competitions have encouraged the use of artificial agents to
assist human dispatchers in operating power grids. In this paper we study the
performance of imitation learning for day-ahead power grid operation through
topology actions. In particular, we consider two rule-based expert agents: a
greedy agent and a N-1 agent. While the latter is more computationally
expensive since it takes N-1 safety considerations into account, it exhibits a
much higher operational performance. We train a fully-connected neural network
(FCNN) on expert state-action pairs and evaluate it in two ways. First, we find
that classification accuracy is limited despite extensive hyperparameter
tuning, due to class imbalance and class overlap. Second, as a power system
agent, the FCNN performs only slightly worse than expert agents. Furthermore,
hybrid agents, which incorporate minimal additional simulations, match expert
agents' performance with significantly lower computational cost. Consequently,
imitation learning shows promise for developing fast, high-performing power
grid agents, motivating its further exploration in future L2RPN studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19865v1,,False
Anomalous State Sequence Modeling to Enhance Safety in Reinforcement Learning,29/07/2024,"Leen Kweider, Maissa Abou Kassem, Ubai Sandouk","The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in decision-making
applications requires ensuring an appropriate level of safety and reliability,
particularly in changing environments that contain a large number of unknown
observations. To address this challenge, we propose a novel safe reinforcement
learning (RL) approach that utilizes an anomalous state sequence to enhance RL
safety. Our proposed solution Safe Reinforcement Learning with Anomalous State
Sequences (AnoSeqs) consists of two stages. First, we train an agent in a
non-safety-critical offline 'source' environment to collect safe state
sequences. Next, we use these safe sequences to build an anomaly detection
model that can detect potentially unsafe state sequences in a 'target'
safety-critical environment where failures can have high costs. The estimated
risk from the anomaly detection model is utilized to train a risk-averse RL
policy in the target environment; this involves adjusting the reward function
to penalize the agent for visiting anomalous states deemed unsafe by our
anomaly model. In experiments on multiple safety-critical benchmarking
environments including self-driving cars, our solution approach successfully
learns safer policies and proves that sequential anomaly detection can provide
an effective supervisory signal for training safety-aware RL agents",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19860v1,,False
Generative model for financial time series trained with MMD using a signature kernel,29/07/2024,"Lu Chung I, Julian Sester","Generating synthetic financial time series data that accurately reflects
real-world market dynamics holds tremendous potential for various applications,
including portfolio optimization, risk management, and large scale machine
learning. We present an approach for training generative models for financial
time series using the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a signature kernel.
Our method leverages the expressive power of the signature transform to capture
the complex dependencies and temporal structures inherent in financial data. We
employ a moving average model to model the variance of the noise input,
enhancing the model's ability to reproduce stylized facts such as volatility
clustering. Through empirical experiments on S&P 500 index data, we demonstrate
that our model effectively captures key characteristics of financial time
series and outperforms a comparable GAN-based approach. In addition, we explore
the application of the synthetic data generated to train a reinforcement
learning agent for portfolio management, achieving promising results. Finally,
we propose a method to add robustness to the generative model by tweaking the
noise input so that the generated sequences can be adjusted to different market
environments with minimal data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19848v1,,False
RNACG: A Universal RNA Sequence Conditional Generation model based on Flow-Matching,29/07/2024,"Letian Gao, Zhi John Lu","RNA plays a crucial role in diverse life processes. In contrast to the rapid
advancement of protein design methods, the work related to RNA is more
demanding. Most current RNA design approaches concentrate on specified target
attributes and rely on extensive experimental searches. However, these methods
remain costly and inefficient due to practical limitations. In this paper, we
characterize all sequence design issues as conditional generation tasks and
offer parameterized representations for multiple problems. For these problems,
we have developed a universal RNA sequence generation model based on flow
matching, namely RNACG. RNACG can accommodate various conditional inputs and is
portable, enabling users to customize the encoding network for conditional
inputs as per their requirements and integrate it into the generation network.
We evaluated RNACG in RNA 3D structure inverse folding, 2D structure inverse
folding, family-specific sequence generation, and 5'UTR translation efficiency
prediction. RNACG attains superior or competitive performance on these tasks
compared with other methods. RNACG exhibits extensive applicability in sequence
generation and property prediction tasks, providing a novel approach to RNA
sequence design and potential methods for simulation experiments with
large-scale RNA sequence data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19838v1,,False
Smart Language Agents in Real-World Planning,29/07/2024,"Annabelle Miin, Timothy Wei","Comprehensive planning agents have been a long term goal in the field of
artificial intelligence. Recent innovations in Natural Language Processing have
yielded success through the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). We seek to
improve the travel-planning capability of such LLMs by extending upon the work
of the previous paper TravelPlanner. Our objective is to explore a new method
of using LLMs to improve the travel planning experience. We focus specifically
on the ""sole-planning"" mode of travel planning; that is, the agent is given
necessary reference information, and its goal is to create a comprehensive plan
from the reference information. While this does not simulate the real-world we
feel that an optimization of the sole-planning capability of a travel planning
agent will still be able to enhance the overall user experience. We propose a
semi-automated prompt generation framework which combines the LLM-automated
prompt and ""human-in-the-loop"" to iteratively refine the prompt to improve the
LLM performance. Our result shows that LLM automated prompt has its limitations
and ""human-in-the-loop"" greatly improves the performance by $139\%$ with one
single iteration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19667v1,,False
