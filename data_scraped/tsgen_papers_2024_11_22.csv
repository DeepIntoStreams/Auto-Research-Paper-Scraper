CoNFiLD-inlet: Synthetic Turbulence Inflow Using Generative Latent Diffusion Models with Neural Fields,21/11/2024,"Xin-Yang Liu, Meet Hemant Parikh, Xiantao Fan, Pan Du, Qing Wang, Yi-Fan Chen, Jian-Xun Wang","Eddy-resolving turbulence simulations require stochastic inflow conditions
that accurately replicate the complex, multi-scale structures of turbulence.
Traditional recycling-based methods rely on computationally expensive precursor
simulations, while existing synthetic inflow generators often fail to reproduce
realistic coherent structures of turbulence. Recent advances in deep learning
(DL) have opened new possibilities for inflow turbulence generation, yet many
DL-based methods rely on deterministic, autoregressive frameworks prone to
error accumulation, resulting in poor robustness for long-term predictions. In
this work, we present CoNFiLD-inlet, a novel DL-based inflow turbulence
generator that integrates diffusion models with a conditional neural field
(CNF)-encoded latent space to produce realistic, stochastic inflow turbulence.
By parameterizing inflow conditions using Reynolds numbers, CoNFiLD-inlet
generalizes effectively across a wide range of Reynolds numbers ($Re_\tau$
between $10^3$ and $10^4$) without requiring retraining or parameter tuning.
Comprehensive validation through a priori and a posteriori tests in Direct
Numerical Simulation (DNS) and Wall-Modeled Large Eddy Simulation (WMLES)
demonstrates its high fidelity, robustness, and scalability, positioning it as
an efficient and versatile solution for inflow turbulence synthesis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14378v1,,False
Generating Realistic Adversarial Examples for Business Processes using Variational Autoencoders,21/11/2024,"Alexander Stevens, Jari Peeperkorn, Johannes De Smedt, Jochen De Weerdt","In predictive process monitoring, predictive models are vulnerable to
adversarial attacks, where input perturbations can lead to incorrect
predictions. Unlike in computer vision, where these perturbations are designed
to be imperceptible to the human eye, the generation of adversarial examples in
predictive process monitoring poses unique challenges. Minor changes to the
activity sequences can create improbable or even impossible scenarios to occur
due to underlying constraints such as regulatory rules or process constraints.
To address this, we focus on generating realistic adversarial examples tailored
to the business process context, in contrast to the imperceptible, pixel-level
changes commonly seen in computer vision adversarial attacks. This paper
introduces two novel latent space attacks, which generate adversaries by adding
noise to the latent space representation of the input data, rather than
directly modifying the input attributes. These latent space methods are
domain-agnostic and do not rely on process-specific knowledge, as we restrict
the generation of adversarial examples to the learned class-specific data
distributions by directly perturbing the latent space representation of the
business process executions. We evaluate these two latent space methods with
six other adversarial attacking methods on eleven real-life event logs and four
predictive models. The first three attacking methods directly permute the
activities of the historically observed business process executions. The fourth
method constrains the adversarial examples to lie within the same data
distribution as the original instances, by projecting the adversarial examples
to the original data distribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14263v1,,False
HARP: A Large-Scale Higher-Order Ambisonic Room Impulse Response Dataset,21/11/2024,"Shivam Saini, Jürgen Peissig","This contribution introduces a dataset of 7th-order Ambisonic Room Impulse
Responses (HOA-RIRs), created using the Image Source Method. By employing
higher-order Ambisonics, our dataset enables precise spatial audio
reproduction, a critical requirement for realistic immersive audio
applications. Leveraging the virtual simulation, we present a unique microphone
configuration, based on the superposition principle, designed to optimize sound
field coverage while addressing the limitations of traditional microphone
arrays. The presented 64-microphone configuration allows us to capture RIRs
directly in the Spherical Harmonics domain. The dataset features a wide range
of room configurations, encompassing variations in room geometry, acoustic
absorption materials, and source-receiver distances. A detailed description of
the simulation setup is provided alongside for an accurate reproduction. The
dataset serves as a vital resource for researchers working on spatial audio,
particularly in applications involving machine learning to improve room
acoustics modeling and sound field synthesis. It further provides a very high
level of spatial resolution and realism crucial for tasks such as source
localization, reverberation prediction, and immersive sound reproduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.14207v1,,False
Accelerated zero-order SGD under high-order smoothness and overparameterized regime,21/11/2024,"Georgii Bychkov, Darina Dvinskikh, Anastasia Antsiferova, Alexander Gasnikov, Aleksandr Lobanov","We present a novel gradient-free algorithm to solve a convex stochastic
optimization problem, such as those encountered in medicine, physics, and
machine learning (e.g., adversarial multi-armed bandit problem), where the
objective function can only be computed through numerical simulation, either as
the result of a real experiment or as feedback given by the function
evaluations from an adversary. Thus we suppose that only a black-box access to
the function values of the objective is available, possibly corrupted by
adversarial noise: deterministic or stochastic. The noisy setup can arise
naturally from modeling randomness within a simulation or by computer
discretization, or when exact values of function are forbidden due to privacy
issues, or when solving non-convex problems as convex ones with an inexact
function oracle. By exploiting higher-order smoothness, fulfilled, e.g., in
logistic regression, we improve the performance of zero-order methods developed
under the assumption of classical smoothness (or having a Lipschitz gradient).
The proposed algorithm enjoys optimal oracle complexity and is designed under
an overparameterization setup, i.e., when the number of model parameters is
much larger than the size of the training dataset. Overparametrized models fit
to the training data perfectly while also having good generalization and
outperforming underparameterized models on unseen data. We provide convergence
guarantees for the proposed algorithm under both types of noise. Moreover, we
estimate the maximum permissible adversarial noise level that maintains the
desired accuracy in the Euclidean setup, and then we extend our results to a
non-Euclidean setup. Our theoretical results are verified on the logistic
regression problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13999v1,,False
Material synthesis through simulations guided by machine learning: a position paper,21/11/2024,"Usman Syed, Federico Cunico, Uzair Khan, Eros Radicchi, Francesco Setti, Adolfo Speghini, Paolo Marone, Filiberto Semenzin, Marco Cristani","In this position paper, we propose an approach for sustainable data
collection in the field of optimal mix design for marble sludge reuse. Marble
sludge, a calcium-rich residual from stone-cutting processes, can be repurposed
by mixing it with various ingredients. However, determining the optimal mix
design is challenging due to the variability in sludge composition and the
costly, time-consuming nature of experimental data collection. Also, we
investigate the possibility of using machine learning models using
meta-learning as an optimization tool to estimate the correct quantity of
stone-cutting sludge to be used in aggregates to obtain a mix design with
specific mechanical properties that can be used successfully in the building
industry. Our approach offers two key advantages: (i) through simulations, a
large dataset can be generated, saving time and money during the data
collection phase, and (ii) Utilizing machine learning models, with performance
enhancement through hyper-parameter optimization via meta-learning, to estimate
optimal mix designs reducing the need for extensive manual experimentation,
lowering costs, minimizing environmental impact, and accelerating the
processing of quarry sludge. Our idea promises to streamline the marble sludge
reuse process by leveraging collective data and advanced machine learning,
promoting sustainability and efficiency in the stonecutting sector.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13953v1,,False
A Dataset for Evaluating Online Anomaly Detection Approaches for Discrete Multivariate Time Series,21/11/2024,"Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Thomas Bäck, Anna V. Kononova","Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is
challenging due to the lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly
available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies,
which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution:
a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art
simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain,
including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. To cater for
both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as
time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the
dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated
and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results
from a small selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational
autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline
experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised
version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting
a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13951v1,,False
Learning to Cooperate with Humans using Generative Agents,21/11/2024,"Yancheng Liang, Daphne Chen, Abhishek Gupta, Simon S. Du, Natasha Jaques","Training agents that can coordinate zero-shot with humans is a key mission in
multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL). Current algorithms focus on training
simulated human partner policies which are then used to train a Cooperator
agent. The simulated human is produced either through behavior cloning over a
dataset of human cooperation behavior, or by using MARL to create a population
of simulated agents. However, these approaches often struggle to produce a
Cooperator that can coordinate well with real humans, since the simulated
humans fail to cover the diverse strategies and styles employed by people in
the real world. We show \emph{learning a generative model of human partners}
can effectively address this issue. Our model learns a latent variable
representation of the human that can be regarded as encoding the human's unique
strategy, intention, experience, or style. This generative model can be
flexibly trained from any (human or neural policy) agent interaction data. By
sampling from the latent space, we can use the generative model to produce
different partners to train Cooperator agents. We evaluate our method --
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}gent \textbf{M}odeling for \textbf{M}ulti-agent
\textbf{A}daptation (GAMMA) -- on Overcooked, a challenging cooperative cooking
game that has become a standard benchmark for zero-shot coordination. We
conduct an evaluation with real human teammates, and the results show that
GAMMA consistently improves performance, whether the generative model is
trained on simulated populations or human datasets. Further, we propose a
method for posterior sampling from the generative model that is biased towards
the human data, enabling us to efficiently improve performance with only a
small amount of expensive human interaction data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13934v1,,False
Exponentially Consistent Nonparametric Clustering of Data Streams,21/11/2024,"Bhupender Singh, Ananth Ram Rajagopalan, Srikrishna Bhashyam","In this paper, we consider nonparametric clustering of $M$ independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) data streams generated from unknown
distributions. The distributions of the $M$ data streams belong to $K$
underlying distribution clusters. Existing results on exponentially consistent
nonparametric clustering algorithms, like single linkage-based (SLINK)
clustering and $k$-medoids distribution clustering, assume that the maximum
intra-cluster distance ($d_L$) is smaller than the minimum inter-cluster
distance ($d_H$). First, in the fixed sample size (FSS) setting, we show that
exponential consistency can be achieved for SLINK clustering under a less
strict assumption, $d_I < d_H$, where $d_I$ is the maximum distance between any
two sub-clusters of a cluster that partition the cluster. Note that $d_I < d_L$
in general. Our results show that SLINK is exponentially consistent for a
larger class of problems than $k$-medoids distribution clustering. We also
identify examples where $k$-medoids clustering is unable to find the true
clusters, but SLINK is exponentially consistent. Then, we propose a sequential
clustering algorithm, named SLINK-SEQ, based on SLINK and prove that it is also
exponentially consistent. Simulation results show that the SLINK-SEQ algorithm
requires fewer expected number of samples than the FSS SLINK algorithm for the
same probability of error.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13922v1,,False
PIORS: Personalized Intelligent Outpatient Reception based on Large Language Model with Multi-Agents Medical Scenario Simulation,21/11/2024,"Zhijie Bao, Qingyun Liu, Ying Guo, Zhengqiang Ye, Jun Shen, Shirong Xie, Jiajie Peng, Xuanjing Huang, Zhongyu Wei","In China, receptionist nurses face overwhelming workloads in outpatient
settings, limiting their time and attention for each patient and ultimately
reducing service quality. In this paper, we present the Personalized
Intelligent Outpatient Reception System (PIORS). This system integrates an
LLM-based reception nurse and a collaboration between LLM and hospital
information system (HIS) into real outpatient reception setting, aiming to
deliver personalized, high-quality, and efficient reception services.
Additionally, to enhance the performance of LLMs in real-world healthcare
scenarios, we propose a medical conversational data generation framework named
Service Flow aware Medical Scenario Simulation (SFMSS), aiming to adapt the LLM
to the real-world environments and PIORS settings. We evaluate the
effectiveness of PIORS and SFMSS through automatic and human assessments
involving 15 users and 15 clinical experts. The results demonstrate that
PIORS-Nurse outperforms all baselines, including the current state-of-the-art
model GPT-4o, and aligns with human preferences and clinical needs. Further

GraCo -- A Graph Composer for Integrated Circuits,21/11/2024,"Stefan Uhlich, Andrea Bonetti, Arun Venkitaraman, Ali Momeni, Ryoga Matsuo, Chia-Yu Hsieh, Eisaku Ohbuchi, Lorenzo Servadei","Designing integrated circuits involves substantial complexity, posing
challenges in revealing its potential applications - from custom digital cells
to analog circuits. Despite extensive research over the past decades in
building versatile and automated frameworks, there remains open room to explore
more computationally efficient AI-based solutions. This paper introduces the
graph composer GraCo, a novel method for synthesizing integrated circuits using
reinforcement learning (RL). GraCo learns to construct a graph step-by-step,
which is then converted into a netlist and simulated with SPICE. We demonstrate
that GraCo is highly configurable, enabling the incorporation of prior design
knowledge into the framework. We formalize how this prior knowledge can be
utilized and, in particular, show that applying consistency checks enhances the
efficiency of the sampling process. To evaluate its performance, we compare
GraCo to a random baseline, which is known to perform well for smaller design
space problems. We demonstrate that GraCo can discover circuits for tasks such
as generating standard cells, including the inverter and the two-input NAND
(NAND2) gate. Compared to a random baseline, GraCo requires 5x fewer sampling
steps to design an inverter and successfully synthesizes a NAND2 gate that is
2.5x faster.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13890v1,,False
When Online Algorithms Influence the Environment: A Dynamical Systems Analysis of the Unintended Consequences,21/11/2024,"Prabhat Lankireddy, Jayakrishnan Nair, D Manjunath","We analyze the effect that online algorithms have on the environment that
they are learning. As a motivation, consider recommendation systems that use
online algorithms to learn optimal product recommendations based on user and
product attributes. It is well known that the sequence of recommendations
affects user preferences. However, typical learning algorithms treat the user
attributes as static and disregard the impact of their recommendations on user
preferences. Our interest is to analyze the effect of this mismatch between the
model assumption of a static environment, and the reality of an evolving
environment affected by the recommendations. To perform this analysis, we first
introduce a model for a generic coupled evolution of the parameters that are
being learned, and the environment that is affected by it. We then frame a
linear bandit recommendation system (RS) into this generic model where the
users are characterized by a state variable that evolves based on the sequence
of recommendations. The learning algorithm of the RS does not explicitly
account for this evolution and assumes that the users are static. A dynamical
system model that captures the coupled evolution of the population state and
the learning algorithm is described, and its equilibrium behavior is analyzed.
We show that when the recommendation algorithm is able to learn the population
preferences in the presence of this mismatch, the algorithm induces similarity
in the preferences of the user population. In particular, we present results on
how different properties of the recommendation algorithm, namely the user
attribute space and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff, effect the
population preferences when they are learned by the algorithm. We demonstrate
these results using model simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13883v1,,False
Generative Fuzzy System for Sequence Generation,21/11/2024,"Hailong Yang, Zhaohong Deng, Wei Zhang, Zhuangzhuang Zhao, Guanjin Wang, Kup-sze Choi","Generative Models (GMs), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have
garnered significant attention in machine learning and artificial intelligence
for their ability to generate new data by learning the statistical properties
of training data and creating data that resemble the original. This capability
offers a wide range of applications across various domains. However, the
complex structures and numerous model parameters of GMs make the input-output
processes opaque, complicating the understanding and control of outputs.
Moreover, the purely data-driven learning mechanism limits GM's ability to
acquire broader knowledge. There remains substantial potential for enhancing
the robustness and generalization capabilities of GMs. In this work, we
introduce the fuzzy system, a classical modeling method that combines data and
knowledge-driven mechanisms, to generative tasks. We propose a novel Generative
Fuzzy System framework, named GenFS, which integrates the deep learning
capabilities of GM with the interpretability and dual-driven mechanisms of
fuzzy systems. Specifically, we propose an end-to-end GenFS-based model for
sequence generation, called FuzzyS2S. A series of experimental studies were
conducted on 12 datasets, covering three distinct categories of generative
tasks: machine translation, code generation, and summary generation. The
results demonstrate that FuzzyS2S outperforms the Transformer in terms of
accuracy and fluency. Furthermore, it exhibits better performance on some
datasets compared to state-of-the-art models T5 and CodeT5.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13867v1,,False
NewsInterview: a Dataset and a Playground to Evaluate LLMs' Ground Gap via Informational Interviews,21/11/2024,"Michael Lu, Hyundong Justin Cho, Weiyan Shi, Jonathan May, Alexander Spangher","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
generating coherent text but often struggle with grounding language and
strategic dialogue. To address this gap, we focus on journalistic interviews, a
domain rich in grounding communication and abundant in data. We curate a
dataset of 40,000 two-person informational interviews from NPR and CNN, and
reveal that LLMs are significantly less likely than human interviewers to use
acknowledgements and to pivot to higher-level questions. Realizing that a
fundamental deficit exists in multi-turn planning and strategic thinking, we
develop a realistic simulated environment, incorporating source personas and
persuasive elements, in order to facilitate the development of agents with
longer-horizon rewards. Our experiments show that while source LLMs mimic human
behavior in information sharing, interviewer LLMs struggle with recognizing
when questions are answered and engaging persuasively, leading to suboptimal
information extraction across model size and capability. These findings
underscore the need for enhancing LLMs' strategic dialogue capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.13779v1,,False
