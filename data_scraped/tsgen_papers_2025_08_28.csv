Neural Conditional Simulation for Complex Spatial Processes,27/08/2025,"Julia Walchessen, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Raphaël Huser, Mikael Kuusela","A key objective in spatial statistics is to simulate from the distribution of
a spatial process at a selection of unobserved locations conditional on
observations (i.e., a predictive distribution) to enable spatial prediction and
uncertainty quantification. However, exact conditional simulation from this
predictive distribution is intractable or inefficient for many spatial process
models. In this paper, we propose neural conditional simulation (NCS), a
general method for spatial conditional simulation that is based on neural
diffusion models. Specifically, using spatial masks, we implement a conditional
score-based diffusion model that evolves Gaussian noise into samples from a
predictive distribution when given a partially observed spatial field and
spatial process parameters as inputs. The diffusion model relies on a neural
network that only requires unconditional samples from the spatial process for
training. Once trained, the diffusion model is amortized with respect to the
observations in the partially observed field, the number and locations of those
observations, and the spatial process parameters, and can therefore be used to
conditionally simulate from a broad class of predictive distributions without
retraining the neural network. We assess the NCS-generated simulations against
simulations from the true conditional distribution of a Gaussian process model,
and against Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations from a Brown--Resnick
process model for spatial extremes. In the latter case, we show that it is more
efficient and accurate to conditionally simulate using NCS than classical MCMC
techniques implemented in standard software. We conclude that NCS enables
efficient and accurate conditional simulation from spatial predictive
distributions that are challenging to sample from using traditional methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20067v1,,False
Using item recommendations and LLMs in marketing email titles,27/08/2025,"Deddy Jobson, Muktti Shukla, Phuong Dinh, Julio Christian Young, Nick Pitton, Nina Chen, Ryan Ginstrom","E-commerce marketplaces make use of a number of marketing channels like
emails, push notifications, etc. to reach their users and stimulate purchases.
Personalized emails especially are a popular touch point for marketers to
inform users of latest items in stock, especially for those who stopped
visiting the marketplace. Such emails contain personalized recommendations
tailored to each user's interests, enticing users to buy relevant items. A
common limitation of these emails is that the primary entry point, the title of
the email, tends to follow fixed templates, failing to inspire enough interest
in the contents. In this work, we explore the potential of large language
models (LLMs) for generating thematic titles that reflect the personalized
content of the emails. We perform offline simulations and conduct online
experiments on the order of millions of users, finding our techniques useful in
improving the engagement between customers and our emails. We highlight key
findings and learnings as we productionize the safe and automated generation of
email titles for millions of users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20024v1,,False
SWIRL: A Staged Workflow for Interleaved Reinforcement Learning in Mobile GUI Control,27/08/2025,"Quanfeng Lu, Zhantao Ma, Shuai Zhong, Jin Wang, Dahai Yu, Michael K. Ng, Ping Luo","The rapid advancement of large vision language models (LVLMs) and agent
systems has heightened interest in mobile GUI agents that can reliably
translate natural language into interface operations. Existing single-agent
approaches, however, remain limited by structural constraints. Although
multi-agent systems naturally decouple different competencies, recent progress
in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has often been hindered by
inefficiency and remains incompatible with current LVLM architectures. To
address these challenges, we introduce SWIRL, a staged workflow for interleaved
reinforcement learning designed for multi-agent systems. SWIRL reformulates
MARL into a sequence of single-agent reinforcement learning tasks, updating one
agent at a time while keeping the others fixed. This formulation enables stable
training and promotes efficient coordination across agents. Theoretically, we
provide a stepwise safety bound, a cross-round monotonic improvement theorem,
and convergence guarantees on return, ensuring robust and principled
optimization. In application to mobile GUI control, SWIRL instantiates a
Navigator that converts language and screen context into structured plans, and
an Interactor that grounds these plans into executable atomic actions.
Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performance on both high-level and
low-level GUI benchmarks. Beyond GUI tasks, SWIRL also demonstrates strong
capability in multi-agent mathematical reasoning, underscoring its potential as
a general framework for developing efficient and robust multi-agent systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.20018v1,,False
Diffusion Language Models Know the Answer Before Decoding,27/08/2025,"Pengxiang Li, Yefan Zhou, Dilxat Muhtar, Lu Yin, Shilin Yan, Li Shen, Yi Liang, Soroush Vosoughi, Shiwei Liu","Diffusion language models (DLMs) have recently emerged as an alternative to
autoregressive approaches, offering parallel sequence generation and flexible
token orders. However, their inference remains slower than that of
autoregressive models, primarily due to the cost of bidirectional attention and
the large number of refinement steps required for high quality outputs. In this
work, we highlight and leverage an overlooked property of DLMs early answer
convergence: in many cases, the correct answer can be internally identified by
half steps before the final decoding step, both under semi-autoregressive and
random remasking schedules. For example, on GSM8K and MMLU, up to 97% and 99%
of instances, respectively, can be decoded correctly using only half of the
refinement steps. Building on this observation, we introduce Prophet, a
training-free fast decoding paradigm that enables early commit decoding.
Specifically, Prophet dynamically decides whether to continue refinement or to
go ""all-in"" (i.e., decode all remaining tokens in one step), using the
confidence gap between the top-2 prediction candidates as the criterion. It
integrates seamlessly into existing DLM implementations, incurs negligible
overhead, and requires no additional training. Empirical evaluations of
LLaDA-8B and Dream-7B across multiple tasks show that Prophet reduces the
number of decoding steps by up to 3.4x while preserving high generation
quality. These results recast DLM decoding as a problem of when to stop
sampling, and demonstrate that early decode convergence provides a simple yet
powerful mechanism for accelerating DLM inference, complementary to existing
speedup techniques. Our code is publicly available at
https://github.com/pixeli99/Prophet.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19982v1,,False
Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions,27/08/2025,"Zhouyu Zhang, Chih-Yuan Chiu, Glen Chou","We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric
constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium
interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer
linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the
interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash
stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical
guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and
unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from
demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction
constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly
satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware
experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing
interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and
non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19945v1,,False
Generative AI for Testing of Autonomous Driving Systems: A Survey,27/08/2025,"Qunying Song, He Ye, Mark Harman, Federica Sarro","Autonomous driving systems (ADS) have been an active area of research, with
the potential to deliver significant benefits to society. However, before
large-scale deployment on public roads, extensive testing is necessary to
validate their functionality and safety under diverse driving conditions.
Therefore, different testing approaches are required, and achieving effective
and efficient testing of ADS remains an open challenge. Recently, generative AI
has emerged as a powerful tool across many domains, and it is increasingly
being applied to ADS testing due to its ability to interpret context, reason
about complex tasks, and generate diverse outputs. To gain a deeper
understanding of its role in ADS testing, we systematically analyzed 91
relevant studies and synthesized their findings into six major application
categories, primarily centered on scenario-based testing of ADS. We also
reviewed their effectiveness and compiled a wide range of datasets, simulators,
ADS, metrics, and benchmarks used for evaluation, while identifying 27
limitations. This survey provides an overview and practical insights into the
use of generative AI for testing ADS, highlights existing challenges, and
outlines directions for future research in this rapidly evolving field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19882v1,,False
Quantum latent distributions in deep generative models,27/08/2025,"Omar Bacarreza, Thorin Farnsworth, Alexander Makarovskiy, Hugo Wallner, Tessa Hicks, Santiago Sempere-Llagostera, John Price, Robert J. A. Francis-Jones, William R. Clements","Many successful families of generative models leverage a low-dimensional
latent distribution that is mapped to a data distribution. Though simple latent
distributions are commonly used, it has been shown that more sophisticated
distributions can improve performance. For instance, recent work has explored
using the distributions produced by quantum processors and found empirical
improvements. However, when latent space distributions produced by quantum
processors can be expected to improve performance, and whether these
improvements are reproducible, are open questions that we investigate in this
work. We prove that, under certain conditions, these ""quantum latent
distributions"" enable generative models to produce data distributions that
classical latent distributions cannot efficiently produce. We also provide
actionable intuitions to identify when such quantum advantages may arise in
real-world settings. We perform benchmarking experiments on both a synthetic
quantum dataset and the QM9 molecular dataset, using both simulated and real
photonic quantum processors. Our results demonstrate that quantum latent
distributions can lead to improved generative performance in GANs compared to a
range of classical baselines. We also explore diffusion and flow matching
models, identifying architectures compatible with quantum latent distributions.
This work confirms that near-term quantum processors can expand the
capabilities of deep generative models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19857v1,,False
Tracking World States with Language Models: State-Based Evaluation Using Chess,27/08/2025,"Romain Harang, Jason Naradowsky, Yaswitha Gujju, Yusuke Miyao","Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit emergent capabilities in structured
domains, suggesting they may implicitly internalize high-fidelity
representations of world models. While probing techniques have shown promising
signs of this in scientific and game-based settings, they rely on
model-specific internal activations, which limit interpretability and
generalizability. In this work, we propose a model-agnostic, state-based
evaluation framework using chess as a benchmark to assess whether LLMs preserve
the semantics of structured environments. Our method analyzes the downstream
legal move distributions (state affordances) to estimate semantic fidelity
between predicted and actual game states. This approach offers a more
meaningful evaluation than conventional string-based metrics by aligning more
closely with the strategic and rule-governed nature of chess. Experimental
results demonstrate that our metrics capture deficiencies in state-tracking,
highlighting limitations of LLMs in maintaining coherent internal models over
long sequences. Our framework provides a robust tool for evaluating structured
reasoning in LLMs without requiring internal model access, and generalizes to a
wide class of symbolic environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19851v1,,False
Conditional Normalizing Flow Surrogate for Monte Carlo Prediction of Radiative Properties in Nanoparticle-Embedded Layers,27/08/2025,"Fahime Seyedheydari, Kevin Conley, Simo Särkkä","We present a probabilistic, data-driven surrogate model for predicting the
radiative properties of nanoparticle embedded scattering media. The model uses
conditional normalizing flows, which learn the conditional distribution of
optical outputs, including reflectance, absorbance, and transmittance, given
input parameters such as the absorption coefficient, scattering coefficient,
anisotropy factor, and particle size distribution. We generate training data
using Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations, with optical properties
derived from Mie theory. Unlike conventional neural networks, the conditional
normalizing flow model yields full posterior predictive distributions, enabling
both accurate forecasts and principled uncertainty quantification. Our results
demonstrate that this model achieves high predictive accuracy and reliable
uncertainty estimates, establishing it as a powerful and efficient surrogate
for radiative transfer simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19841v1,,False
Fast 3D Diffusion for Scalable Granular Media Synthesis,27/08/2025,"Muhammad Moeeze Hassan, Régis Cottereau, Filippo Gatti, Patryk Dec","Simulating granular media, using Discrete Element Method is a computationally
intensive task. This is especially true during initialization phase, which
dominates total simulation time because of large displacements involved and
associated kinetic energy. We overcome this bottleneck with a novel generative
pipeline based on 3D diffusion models that directly synthesizes arbitrarily
large granular assemblies in their final and physically realistic
configurations. The approach frames the problem as a 3D generative modeling
task, consisting of a two-stage pipeline. First a diffusion model is trained to
generate independent 3D voxel grids representing granular media. Second, a 3D
inpainting model, adapted from 2D inpainting techniques using masked inputs,
stitches these grids together seamlessly, enabling synthesis of large samples
with physically realistic structure. The inpainting model explores several
masking strategies for the inputs to the underlying UNets by training the
network to infer missing portions of voxel grids from a concatenation of noised
tensors, masks, and masked tensors as input channels. The model also adapts a
2D repainting technique of re-injecting noise scheduler output with ground
truth to provide a strong guidance to the 3D model. This along with weighted
losses ensures long-term coherence over generation of masked regions. Both
models are trained on the same binarized 3D occupancy grids extracted from
small-scale DEM simulations, achieving linear scaling of computational time
with respect to sample size. Quantitatively, a 1.2 m long ballasted rail track
synthesis equivalent to a 3-hour DEM simulation, was completed under 20
seconds. The generated voxel grids can also be post-processed to extract grain
geometries for DEM-compatibility as well, enabling physically coherent,
real-time, scalable granular media synthesis for industrial applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19752v1,,False
Beyond BEV: Optimizing Point-Level Tokens for Collaborative Perception,27/08/2025,"Yang Li, Quan Yuan, Guiyang Luo, Xiaoyuan Fu, Rui Pan, Yujia Yang, Congzhang Shao, Yuewen Liu, Jinglin Li","Collaborative perception allows agents to enhance their perceptual
capabilities by exchanging intermediate features. Existing methods typically
organize these intermediate features as 2D bird's-eye-view (BEV)
representations, which discard critical fine-grained 3D structural cues
essential for accurate object recognition and localization. To this end, we
first introduce point-level tokens as intermediate representations for
collaborative perception. However, point-cloud data are inherently unordered,
massive, and position-sensitive, making it challenging to produce compact and
aligned point-level token sequences that preserve detailed structural
information. Therefore, we present CoPLOT, a novel Collaborative perception
framework that utilizes Point-Level Optimized Tokens. It incorporates a
point-native processing pipeline, including token reordering, sequence
modeling, and multi-agent spatial alignment. A semantic-aware token reordering
module generates adaptive 1D reorderings by leveraging scene-level and
token-level semantic information. A frequency-enhanced state space model
captures long-range sequence dependencies across both spatial and spectral
domains, improving the differentiation between foreground tokens and background
clutter. Lastly, a neighbor-to-ego alignment module applies a closed-loop
process, combining global agent-level correction with local token-level
refinement to mitigate localization noise. Extensive experiments on both
simulated and real-world datasets show that CoPLOT outperforms state-of-the-art
models, with even lower communication and computation overhead. Code will be
available at https://github.com/CheeryLeeyy/CoPLOT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19638v1,,False
Instructional Agents: LLM Agents on Automated Course Material Generation for Teaching Faculties,27/08/2025,"Huaiyuan Yao, Wanpeng Xu, Justin Turnau, Nadia Kellam, Hua Wei","Preparing high-quality instructional materials remains a labor-intensive
process that often requires extensive coordination among teaching faculty,
instructional designers, and teaching assistants. In this work, we present
Instructional Agents, a multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework
designed to automate end-to-end course material generation, including syllabus
creation, lecture scripts, LaTeX-based slides, and assessments. Unlike existing
AI-assisted educational tools that focus on isolated tasks, Instructional
Agents simulates role-based collaboration among educational agents to produce
cohesive and pedagogically aligned content. The system operates in four modes:
Autonomous, Catalog-Guided, Feedback-Guided, and Full Co-Pilot mode, enabling
flexible control over the degree of human involvement. We evaluate
Instructional Agents across five university-level computer science courses and
show that it produces high-quality instructional materials while significantly
reducing development time and human workload. By supporting institutions with
limited instructional design capacity, Instructional Agents provides a scalable
and cost-effective framework to democratize access to high-quality education,

FinCast: A Foundation Model for Financial Time-Series Forecasting,27/08/2025,"Zhuohang Zhu, Haodong Chen, Qiang Qu, Vera Chung","Financial time-series forecasting is critical for maintaining economic
stability, guiding informed policymaking, and promoting sustainable investment
practices. However, it remains challenging due to various underlying pattern
shifts. These shifts arise primarily from three sources: temporal
non-stationarity (distribution changes over time), multi-domain diversity
(distinct patterns across financial domains such as stocks, commodities, and
futures), and varying temporal resolutions (patterns differing across
per-second, hourly, daily, or weekly indicators). While recent deep learning
methods attempt to address these complexities, they frequently suffer from
overfitting and typically require extensive domain-specific fine-tuning. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce FinCast, the first foundation model
specifically designed for financial time-series forecasting, trained on
large-scale financial datasets. Remarkably, FinCast exhibits robust zero-shot
performance, effectively capturing diverse patterns without domain-specific
fine-tuning. Comprehensive empirical and qualitative evaluations demonstrate
that FinCast surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its
strong generalization capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19609v1,,False
Energy-Efficient Learning-Based Beamforming for ISAC-Enabled V2X Networks,27/08/2025,"Chen Shang, Jiadong Yu, Dinh Thai Hoang","This work proposes an energy-efficient, learning-based beamforming scheme for
integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled V2X networks. Specifically,
we first model the dynamic and uncertain nature of V2X environments as a Markov
Decision Process. This formulation allows the roadside unit to generate
beamforming decisions based solely on current sensing information, thereby
eliminating the need for frequent pilot transmissions and extensive channel
state information acquisition. We then develop a deep reinforcement learning
(DRL) algorithm to jointly optimize beamforming and power allocation, ensuring
both communication throughput and sensing accuracy in highly dynamic scenario.
To address the high energy demands of conventional learning-based schemes, we
embed spiking neural networks (SNNs) into the DRL framework. Leveraging their
event-driven and sparsely activated architecture, SNNs significantly enhance
energy efficiency while maintaining robust performance. Simulation results
confirm that the proposed method achieves substantial energy savings and
superior communication performance, demonstrating its potential to support
green and sustainable connectivity in future V2X systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.19566v1,,False
