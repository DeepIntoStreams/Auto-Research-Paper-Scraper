Scaling flow-based approaches for topology sampling in $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ gauge theory,29/10/2025,"Claudio Bonanno, Andrea Bulgarelli, Elia Cellini, Alessandro Nada, Dario Panfalone, Davide Vadacchino, Lorenzo Verzichelli","We develop a methodology based on out-of-equilibrium simulations to mitigate
topological freezing when approaching the continuum limit of lattice gauge
theories. We reduce the autocorrelation of the topological charge employing
open boundary conditions, while removing exactly their unphysical effects using
a non-equilibrium Monte Carlo approach in which periodic boundary conditions
are gradually switched on. We perform a detailed analysis of the computational
costs of this strategy in the case of the four-dimensional $\mathrm{SU}(3)$
Yang-Mills theory. After achieving full control of the scaling, we outline a
clear strategy to sample topology efficiently in the continuum limit, which we
check at lattice spacings as small as $0.045$ fm. We also generalize this
approach by designing a customized Stochastic Normalizing Flow for evolutions
in the boundary conditions, obtaining superior performances with respect to the
purely stochastic non-equilibrium approach, and paving the way for more
efficient future flow-based solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25704v1,,False
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator: Graph Neural Networks for Structural Dynamics,29/10/2025,"Alessandro Lucchetti, Francesco Cadini, Marco Giglio, Luca Lomazzi","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25683v1,,False
Mechanistic Interpretability of RNNs emulating Hidden Markov Models,29/10/2025,"Elia Torre, Michele Viscione, Lucas Pompe, Benjamin F Grewe, Valerio Mante","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of ""kick neurons"" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25674v1,,False
Continuous subsurface property retrieval from sparse radar observations using physics informed neural networks,29/10/2025,"Ishfaq Aziz, Mohamad Alipour","Estimating subsurface dielectric properties is essential for applications
ranging from environmental surveys of soils to nondestructive evaluation of
concrete in infrastructure. Conventional wave inversion methods typically
assume few discrete homogeneous layers and require dense measurements or strong
prior knowledge of material boundaries, limiting scalability and accuracy in
realistic settings where properties vary continuously. We present a physics
informed machine learning framework that reconstructs subsurface permittivity
as a fully neural, continuous function of depth, trained to satisfy both
measurement data and Maxwells equations. We validate the framework with both
simulations and custom built radar experiments on multilayered natural
materials. Results show close agreement with in-situ permittivity measurements
(R^2=0.93), with sensitivity to even subtle variations (Delta eps_r=2).
Parametric analysis reveals that accurate profiles can be recovered with as few
as three strategically placed sensors in two layer systems. This approach
reframes subsurface inversion from boundary-driven to continuous property
estimation, enabling accurate characterization of smooth permittivity
variations and advancing electromagnetic imaging using low cost radar systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25648v1,,False
Hybrid Quantum-Classical Recurrent Neural Networks,29/10/2025,Wenduan Xu,"We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25557v1,,False
Error Bounds and Optimal Schedules for Masked Diffusions with Factorized Approximations,29/10/2025,"Hugo Lavenant, Giacomo Zanella","Recently proposed generative models for discrete data, such as Masked
Diffusion Models (MDMs), exploit conditional independence approximations to
reduce the computational cost of popular Auto-Regressive Models (ARMs), at the
price of some bias in the sampling distribution. We study the resulting
computation-vs-accuracy trade-off, providing general error bounds (in relative
entropy) that depend only on the average number of tokens generated per
iteration and are independent of the data dimensionality (i.e. sequence
length), thus supporting the empirical success of MDMs. We then investigate the
gain obtained by using non-constant schedule sizes (i.e. varying the number of
unmasked tokens during the generation process) and identify the optimal
schedule as a function of a so-called information profile of the data
distribution, thus allowing for a principled optimization of schedule sizes. We
define methods directly as sampling algorithms and do not use classical
derivations as time-reversed diffusion processes, leading us to simple and
transparent proofs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25544v1,,False
Transformers Provably Learn Directed Acyclic Graphs via Kernel-Guided Mutual Information,29/10/2025,"Yuan Cheng, Yu Huang, Zhe Xiong, Yingbin Liang, Vincent Y. F. Tan","Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25542v1,,False
TempoPFN: Synthetic Pre-training of Linear RNNs for Zero-shot Time Series Forecasting,29/10/2025,"Vladyslav Moroshan, Julien Siems, Arber Zela, Timur Carstensen, Frank Hutter","Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully
parallelizable training across sequence lengths, eliminating the need for
windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast
majority of models trained on real-world data, while being more efficient than
existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,

Grounded in Reality: Learning and Deploying Proactive LLM from Offline Logs,29/10/2025,"Fei Wei, Daoyuan Chen, Ce Wang, Yilun Huang, Yushuo Chen, Xuchen Pan, Yaliang Li, Bolin Ding","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel as passive responders, but teaching them
to be proactive, goal-oriented partners, a critical capability in high-stakes
domains, remains a major challenge. Current paradigms either myopically
optimize single-turn attributes or rely on brittle, high-cost user simulators,
creating a persistent ``reality gap''. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\texttt{Learn-to-Ask}, a general, simulator-free framework for learning and
deploying proactive dialogue agents \textit{directly from offline expert data},
bypassing the need to model complex user dynamics. Our key insight is to
reframe the offline policy learning problem by leveraging the \textbf{observed
future} of each expert trajectory. This allows us to infer a dense,
turn-by-turn reward signal grounded in the expert's revealed strategy,
decomposing the intractable long-horizon problem into a series of supervised
learning tasks, and training a policy to output a structured \texttt{(action,
state_assessment)} tuple, governing both \textbf{what to ask} and, crucially,
\textbf{when to stop}. To ensure reward fidelity, our Automated Grader
Calibration pipeline systematically purges noise from the LLM-based reward
model with minimal human supervision. Empirically, we demonstrate the efficacy
of \texttt{Learn-to-Ask} in a real-world medical dataset, using LLMs of varying
sizes up to 32B. Our approach culminates in the successful deployment of LLMs
into a live, large-scale online AI service. In rigorous in-house evaluations,
our model was launched and achieved performance even superior to human experts,
proving our framework's ability to translate offline data into tangible,
real-world impact. We hope this work provides a practical and economically
viable blueprint for transforming passive LLMs into proactive, goal-oriented
LLM applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25441v1,,False
Adaptive End-to-End Transceiver Design for NextG Pilot-Free and CP-Free Wireless Systems,29/10/2025,"Jiaming Cheng, Wei Chen, Bo Ai","The advent of artificial intelligence (AI)-native wireless communication is
fundamentally reshaping the design paradigm of next-generation (NextG) systems,
where intelligent air interfaces are expected to operate adaptively and
efficiently in highly dynamic environments. Conventional orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM) systems rely heavily on pilots and the cyclic
prefix (CP), resulting in significant overhead and reduced spectral efficiency.
To address these limitations, we propose an adaptive end-to-end (E2E)
transceiver architecture tailored for pilot-free and CP-free wireless systems.
The architecture combines AI-driven constellation shaping and a neural receiver
through joint training. To enhance robustness against mismatched or
time-varying channel conditions, we introduce a lightweight channel adapter
(CA) module, which enables rapid adaptation with minimal computational overhead
by updating only the CA parameters. Additionally, we present a framework that
is scalable to multiple modulation orders within a unified model, significantly
reducing model storage requirements. Moreover, to tackle the high
peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) inherent to OFDM, we incorporate constrained
E2E training, achieving compliance with PAPR targets without additional
transmission overhead. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed
framework delivers superior bit error rate (BER), throughput, and resilience
across diverse channel scenarios, highlighting its potential for AI-native
NextG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25416v1,,False
SynHLMA:Synthesizing Hand Language Manipulation for Articulated Object with Discrete Human Object Interaction Representation,29/10/2025,"Wang zhi, Yuyan Liu, Liu Liu, Li Zhang, Ruixuan Lu, Dan Guo","Generating hand grasps with language instructions is a widely studied topic
that benefits from embodied AI and VR/AR applications. While transferring into
hand articulatied object interaction (HAOI), the hand grasps synthesis requires
not only object functionality but also long-term manipulation sequence along
the object deformation. This paper proposes a novel HAOI sequence generation
framework SynHLMA, to synthesize hand language manipulation for articulated
objects. Given a complete point cloud of an articulated object, we utilize a
discrete HAOI representation to model each hand object interaction frame. Along
with the natural language embeddings, the representations are trained by an
HAOI manipulation language model to align the grasping process with its
language description in a shared representation space. A joint-aware loss is
employed to ensure hand grasps follow the dynamic variations of articulated
object joints. In this way, our SynHLMA achieves three typical hand
manipulation tasks for articulated objects of HAOI generation, HAOI prediction
and HAOI interpolation. We evaluate SynHLMA on our built HAOI-lang dataset and
experimental results demonstrate the superior hand grasp sequence generation
performance comparing with state-of-the-art. We also show a robotics grasp
application that enables dexterous grasps execution from imitation learning
using the manipulation sequence provided by our SynHLMA. Our codes and datasets
will be made publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25268v1,,False
TV-Rec: Time-Variant Convolutional Filter for Sequential Recommendation,29/10/2025,"Yehjin Shin, Jeongwhan Choi, Seojin Kim, Noseong Park","Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25259v1,,False
One-shot Humanoid Whole-body Motion Learning,29/10/2025,"Hao Huang, Geeta Chandra Raju Bethala, Shuaihang Yuan, Congcong Wen, Anthony Tzes, Yi Fang","Whole-body humanoid motion represents a cornerstone challenge in robotics,
integrating balance, coordination, and adaptability to enable human-like
behaviors. However, existing methods typically require multiple training
samples per motion category, rendering the collection of high-quality human
motion datasets both labor-intensive and costly. To address this, we propose a
novel approach that trains effective humanoid motion policies using only a
single non-walking target motion sample alongside readily available walking
motions. The core idea lies in leveraging order-preserving optimal transport to
compute distances between walking and non-walking sequences, followed by
interpolation along geodesics to generate new intermediate pose skeletons,
which are then optimized for collision-free configurations and retargeted to
the humanoid before integration into a simulated environment for policy
training via reinforcement learning. Experimental evaluations on the CMU MoCap
dataset demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms baselines,
achieving superior performance across metrics. Code will be released upon

Generative Bayesian Optimization: Generative Models as Acquisition Functions,29/10/2025,"Rafael Oliveira, Daniel M. Steinberg, Edwin V. Bonilla","We present a general strategy for turning generative models into candidate
solution samplers for batch Bayesian optimization (BO). The use of generative
models for BO enables large batch scaling as generative sampling, optimization
of non-continuous design spaces, and high-dimensional and combinatorial design.
Inspired by the success of direct preference optimization (DPO), we show that
one can train a generative model with noisy, simple utility values directly
computed from observations to then form proposal distributions whose densities
are proportional to the expected utility, i.e., BO's acquisition function
values. Furthermore, this approach is generalizable beyond preference-based
feedback to general types of reward signals and loss functions. This
perspective avoids the construction of surrogate (regression or classification)
models, common in previous methods that have used generative models for
black-box optimization. Theoretically, we show that the generative models
within the BO process approximately follow a sequence of distributions which
asymptotically concentrate at the global optima under certain conditions. We
also demonstrate this effect through experiments on challenging optimization
problems involving large batches in high dimensions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25240v1,,False
Learning Disentangled Speech- and Expression-Driven Blendshapes for 3D Talking Face Animation,29/10/2025,"Yuxiang Mao, Zhijie Zhang, Zhiheng Zhang, Jiawei Liu, Chen Zeng, Shihong Xia","Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25234v1,,False
GReF: A Unified Generative Framework for Efficient Reranking via Ordered Multi-token Prediction,29/10/2025,"Zhijie Lin, Zhuofeng Li, Chenglei Dai, Wentian Bao, Shuai Lin, Enyun Yu, Haoxiang Zhang, Liang Zhao","In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25220v1,,False

TabMGP: Martingale Posterior with TabPFN,29/10/2025,"Kenyon Ng, Edwin Fong, David T. Frazier, Jeremias Knoblauch, Susan Wei","Bayesian inference provides principled uncertainty quantification but is
often limited by challenges of prior elicitation, likelihood misspecification,

offers an alternative, replacing prior-likelihood elicitation with a predictive
rule - namely, a sequence of one-step-ahead predictive distributions - for
forward data generation. The utility of MGPs depends on the choice of
predictive rule, yet the literature has offered few compelling examples.
Foundation transformers are well-suited here, as their autoregressive
generation mirrors this forward simulation and their general-purpose design
enables rich predictive modeling. We introduce TabMGP, an MGP built on TabPFN,

An Analysis of Causal Effect Estimation using Outcome Invariant Data Augmentation,29/10/2025,"Uzair Akbar, Niki Kilbertus, Hao Shen, Krikamol Muandet, Bo Dai","The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25128v1,,False
Bridging the Divide: End-to-End Sequence-Graph Learning,29/10/2025,"Yuen Chen, Yulun Wu, Samuel Sharpe, Igor Melnyk, Nam H. Nguyen, Furong Huang, C. Bayan Bruss, Rizal Fathony","Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node

sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level

Scalable predictive processing framework for multitask caregiving robots,29/10/2025,"Hayato Idei, Tamon Miyake, Tetsuya Ogata, Yuichi Yamashita","The rapid aging of societies is intensifying demand for autonomous care
robots; however, most existing systems are task-specific and rely on
handcrafted preprocessing, limiting their ability to generalize across diverse
scenarios. A prevailing theory in cognitive neuroscience proposes that the
human brain operates through hierarchical predictive processing, which
underlies flexible cognition and behavior by integrating multimodal sensory
signals. Inspired by this principle, we introduce a hierarchical multimodal
recurrent neural network grounded in predictive processing under the
free-energy principle, capable of directly integrating over 30,000-dimensional
visuo-proprioceptive inputs without dimensionality reduction. The model was
able to learn two representative caregiving tasks, rigid-body repositioning and
flexible-towel wiping, without task-specific feature engineering. We
demonstrate three key properties: (i) self-organization of hierarchical latent
dynamics that regulate task transitions, capture variability in uncertainty,
and infer occluded states; (ii) robustness to degraded vision through
visuo-proprioceptive integration; and (iii) asymmetric interference in
multitask learning, where the more variable wiping task had little influence on
repositioning, whereas learning the repositioning task led to a modest
reduction in wiping performance, while the model maintained overall robustness.
Although the evaluation was limited to simulation, these results establish
predictive processing as a universal and scalable computational principle,
pointing toward robust, flexible, and autonomous caregiving robots while
offering theoretical insight into the human brain's ability to achieve flexible
adaptation in uncertain real-world environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25053v1,,False
