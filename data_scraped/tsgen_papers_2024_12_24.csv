Token Statistics Transformer: Linear-Time Attention via Variational Rate Reduction,23/12/2024,"Ziyang Wu, Tianjiao Ding, Yifu Lu, Druv Pai, Jingyuan Zhang, Weida Wang, Yaodong Yu, Yi Ma, Benjamin D. Haeffele","The attention operator is arguably the key distinguishing factor of
transformer architectures, which have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance
on a variety of tasks. However, transformer attention operators often impose a
significant computational burden, with the computational complexity scaling
quadratically with the number of tokens. In this work, we propose a novel
transformer attention operator whose computational complexity scales linearly
with the number of tokens. We derive our network architecture by extending
prior work which has shown that a transformer style architecture naturally
arises by ""white-box"" architecture design, where each layer of the network is
designed to implement an incremental optimization step of a maximal coding rate
reduction objective (MCR$^2$). Specifically, we derive a novel variational form
of the MCR$^2$ objective and show that the architecture that results from
unrolled gradient descent of this variational objective leads to a new
attention module called Token Statistics Self-Attention (TSSA). TSSA has linear
computational and memory complexity and radically departs from the typical
attention architecture that computes pairwise similarities between tokens.
Experiments on vision, language, and long sequence tasks show that simply
swapping TSSA for standard self-attention, which we refer to as the Token
Statistics Transformer (ToST), achieves competitive performance with
conventional transformers while being significantly more computationally
efficient and interpretable. Our results also somewhat call into question the
conventional wisdom that pairwise similarity style attention mechanisms are
critical to the success of transformer architectures. Code will be available at

Automating the Search for Artificial Life with Foundation Models,23/12/2024,"Akarsh Kumar, Chris Lu, Louis Kirsch, Yujin Tang, Kenneth O. Stanley, Phillip Isola, David Ha","With the recent Nobel Prize awarded for radical advances in protein
discovery, foundation models (FMs) for exploring large combinatorial spaces
promise to revolutionize many scientific fields. Artificial Life (ALife) has
not yet integrated FMs, thus presenting a major opportunity for the field to
alleviate the historical burden of relying chiefly on manual design and
trial-and-error to discover the configurations of lifelike simulations. This
paper presents, for the first time, a successful realization of this
opportunity using vision-language FMs. The proposed approach, called Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL), (1) finds simulations that produce target
phenomena, (2) discovers simulations that generate temporally open-ended
novelty, and (3) illuminates an entire space of interestingly diverse
simulations. Because of the generality of FMs, ASAL works effectively across a
diverse range of ALife substrates including Boids, Particle Life, Game of Life,
Lenia, and Neural Cellular Automata. A major result highlighting the potential
of this technique is the discovery of previously unseen Lenia and Boids
lifeforms, as well as cellular automata that are open-ended like Conway's Game
of Life. Additionally, the use of FMs allows for the quantification of
previously qualitative phenomena in a human-aligned way. This new paradigm
promises to accelerate ALife research beyond what is possible through human
ingenuity alone.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17799v1,,False
PepTune: De Novo Generation of Therapeutic Peptides with Multi-Objective-Guided Discrete Diffusion,23/12/2024,"Sophia Tang, Yinuo Zhang, Pranam Chatterjee","Peptide therapeutics, a major class of medicines, have achieved remarkable
success across diseases such as diabetes and cancer, with landmark examples
such as GLP-1 receptor agonists revolutionizing the treatment of type-2
diabetes and obesity. Despite their success, designing peptides that satisfy
multiple conflicting objectives, such as target binding affinity, solubility,
and membrane permeability, remains a major challenge. Classical drug
development and structure-based design are ineffective for such tasks, as they
fail to optimize global functional properties critical for therapeutic
efficacy. Existing generative frameworks are largely limited to continuous
spaces, unconditioned outputs, or single-objective guidance, making them
unsuitable for discrete sequence optimization across multiple properties. To
address this, we present PepTune, a multi-objective discrete diffusion model
for the simultaneous generation and optimization of therapeutic peptide SMILES.
Built on the Masked Discrete Language Model (MDLM) framework, PepTune ensures
valid peptide structures with state-dependent masking schedules and
penalty-based objectives. To guide the diffusion process, we propose a Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)-based strategy that balances exploration and
exploitation to iteratively refine Pareto-optimal sequences. MCTS integrates
classifier-based rewards with search-tree expansion, overcoming gradient
estimation challenges and data sparsity inherent to discrete spaces. Using
PepTune, we generate diverse, chemically-modified peptides optimized for
multiple therapeutic properties, including target binding affinity, membrane
permeability, solubility, hemolysis, and non-fouling characteristics on various
disease-relevant targets. In total, our results demonstrate that MCTS-guided
discrete diffusion is a powerful and modular approach for multi-objective
sequence design in discrete state spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17780v1,,False
ResearchTown: Simulator of Human Research Community,23/12/2024,"Haofei Yu, Zhaochen Hong, Zirui Cheng, Kunlun Zhu, Keyang Xuan, Jinwei Yao, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in
scientific domains, yet a fundamental question remains unanswered: Can we
simulate human research communities with LLMs? Addressing this question can
deepen our understanding of the processes behind idea brainstorming and inspire
the automatic discovery of novel scientific insights. In this work, we propose
ResearchTown, a multi-agent framework for research community simulation. Within
this framework, the human research community is simplified and modeled as an
agent-data graph, where researchers and papers are represented as agent-type
and data-type nodes, respectively, and connected based on their collaboration
relationships. We also introduce TextGNN, a text-based inference framework that
models various research activities (e.g., paper reading, paper writing, and
review writing) as special forms of a unified message-passing process on the
agent-data graph. To evaluate the quality of the research simulation, we
present ResearchBench, a benchmark that uses a node-masking prediction task for
scalable and objective assessment based on similarity. Our experiments reveal
three key findings: (1) ResearchTown can provide a realistic simulation of
collaborative research activities, including paper writing and review writing;
(2) ResearchTown can maintain robust simulation with multiple researchers and
diverse papers; (3) ResearchTown can generate interdisciplinary research ideas
that potentially inspire novel research directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17767v1,,False
Deliberation in Latent Space via Differentiable Cache Augmentation,23/12/2024,"Luyang Liu, Jonas Pfeiffer, Jiaxing Wu, Jun Xie, Arthur Szlam","Techniques enabling large language models (LLMs) to ""think more"" by
generating and attending to intermediate reasoning steps have shown promise in
solving complex problems. However, the standard approaches generate sequences
of discrete tokens immediately before responding, and so they can incur
significant latency costs and be challenging to optimize. In this work, we
demonstrate that a frozen LLM can be augmented with an offline coprocessor that
operates on the model's key-value (kv) cache. This coprocessor augments the
cache with a set of latent embeddings designed to improve the fidelity of
subsequent decoding. We train this coprocessor using the language modeling loss
from the decoder on standard pretraining data, while keeping the decoder itself
frozen. This approach enables the model to learn, in an end-to-end
differentiable fashion, how to distill additional computation into its
kv-cache. Because the decoder remains unchanged, the coprocessor can operate
offline and asynchronously, and the language model can function normally if the
coprocessor is unavailable or if a given cache is deemed not to require extra
computation. We show experimentally that when a cache is augmented, the decoder
achieves lower perplexity on numerous subsequent tokens. Furthermore, even
without any task-specific training, our experiments demonstrate that cache
augmentation consistently reduces perplexity and improves performance across a
range of reasoning-intensive tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17747v1,,False
Sensitivity Curve Maximization: Attacking Robust Aggregators in Distributed Learning,23/12/2024,"Christian A. Schroth, Stefan Vlaski, Abdelhak M. Zoubir","In distributed learning agents aim at collaboratively solving a global
learning problem. It becomes more and more likely that individual agents are
malicious or faulty with an increasing size of the network. This leads to a
degeneration or complete breakdown of the learning process. Classical
aggregation schemes are prone to breakdown at small contamination rates,
therefore robust aggregation schemes are sought for. While robust aggregation
schemes can generally tolerate larger contamination rates, many have been shown
to be susceptible to carefully crafted malicious attacks. In this work, we show
how the sensitivity curve (SC), a classical tool from robust statistics, can be
used to systematically derive optimal attack patterns against arbitrary robust
aggregators, in most cases rendering them ineffective. We show the
effectiveness of the proposed attack in multiple simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17740v1,,False
SMAC-Hard: Enabling Mixed Opponent Strategy Script and Self-play on SMAC,23/12/2024,"Yue Deng, Yan Yu, Weiyu Ma, Zirui Wang, Wenhui Zhu, Jian Zhao, Yin Zhang","The availability of challenging simulation environments is pivotal for
advancing the field of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). In
cooperative MARL settings, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has
gained prominence as a benchmark for algorithms following centralized training
with decentralized execution paradigm. However, with continual advancements in
SMAC, many algorithms now exhibit near-optimal performance, complicating the
evaluation of their true effectiveness. To alleviate this problem, in this
work, we highlight a critical issue: the default opponent policy in these
environments lacks sufficient diversity, leading MARL algorithms to overfit and
exploit unintended vulnerabilities rather than learning robust strategies. To
overcome these limitations, we propose SMAC-HARD, a novel benchmark designed to
enhance training robustness and evaluation comprehensiveness. SMAC-HARD
supports customizable opponent strategies, randomization of adversarial
policies, and interfaces for MARL self-play, enabling agents to generalize to
varying opponent behaviors and improve model stability. Furthermore, we
introduce a black-box testing framework wherein agents are trained without
exposure to the edited opponent scripts but are tested against these scripts to
evaluate the policy coverage and adaptability of MARL algorithms. We conduct
extensive evaluations of widely used and state-of-the-art algorithms on
SMAC-HARD, revealing the substantial challenges posed by edited and mixed
strategy opponents. Additionally, the black-box strategy tests illustrate the
difficulty of transferring learned policies to unseen adversaries. We envision
SMAC-HARD as a critical step toward benchmarking the next generation of MARL
algorithms, fostering progress in self-play methods for multi-agent systems.

Jensen, Bin Yang","Time series forecasting has important applications across diverse domains.
EasyTime, the system we demonstrate, facilitates easy use of time-series
forecasting methods by researchers and practitioners alike. First, EasyTime
enables one-click evaluation, enabling researchers to evaluate new forecasting
methods using the suite of diverse time series datasets collected in the
preexisting time series forecasting benchmark (TFB). This is achieved by
leveraging TFB's flexible and consistent evaluation pipeline. Second, when
practitioners must perform forecasting on a new dataset, a nontrivial first

Optimal Convergence Rates for Neural Operators,23/12/2024,"Mike Nguyen, Nicole Mücke","We introduce the neural tangent kernel (NTK) regime for two-layer neural
operators and analyze their generalization properties. For early-stopped
gradient descent (GD), we derive fast convergence rates that are known to be
minimax optimal within the framework of non-parametric regression in
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHS). We provide bounds on the number of
hidden neurons and the number of second-stage samples necessary for
generalization. To justify our NTK regime, we additionally show that any
operator approximable by a neural operator can also be approximated by an
operator from the RKHS. A key application of neural operators is learning
surrogate maps for the solution operators of partial differential equations
(PDEs). We consider the standard Poisson equation to illustrate our theoretical
findings with simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17518v1,,False
Improving the Noise Estimation of Latent Neural Stochastic Differential Equations,23/12/2024,"Linus Heck, Maximilian Gelbrecht, Michael T. Schaub, Niklas Boers","Latent neural stochastic differential equations (SDEs) have recently emerged
as a promising approach for learning generative models from stochastic time
series data. However, they systematically underestimate the noise level
inherent in such data, limiting their ability to capture stochastic dynamics
accurately. We investigate this underestimation in detail and propose a
straightforward solution: by including an explicit additional noise
regularization in the loss function, we are able to learn a model that
accurately captures the diffusion component of the data. We demonstrate our
results on a conceptual model system that highlights the improved latent neural
SDE's capability to model stochastic bistable dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17499v1,,False
DeepMF: Deep Motion Factorization for Closed-Loop Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Simulation,23/12/2024,"Yizhe Li, Linrui Zhang, Xueqian Wang, Houde Liu, Bin Liang","Safety-critical traffic scenarios are of great practical relevance to
evaluating the robustness of autonomous driving (AD) systems. Given that these
long-tail events are extremely rare in real-world traffic data, there is a
growing body of work dedicated to the automatic traffic scenario generation.
However, nearly all existing algorithms for generating safety-critical
scenarios rely on snippets of previously recorded traffic events, transforming
normal traffic flow into accident-prone situations directly. In other words,
safety-critical traffic scenario generation is hindsight and not applicable to
newly encountered and open-ended traffic events.In this paper, we propose the
Deep Motion Factorization (DeepMF) framework, which extends static
safety-critical driving scenario generation to closed-loop and interactive
adversarial traffic simulation. DeepMF casts safety-critical traffic simulation
as a Bayesian factorization that includes the assignment of hazardous traffic
participants, the motion prediction of selected opponents, the reaction
estimation of autonomous vehicle (AV) and the probability estimation of the
accident occur. All the aforementioned terms are calculated using decoupled
deep neural networks, with inputs limited to the current observation and
historical states. Consequently, DeepMF can effectively and efficiently
simulate safety-critical traffic scenarios at any triggered time and for any
duration by maximizing the compounded posterior probability of traffic risk.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeepMF excels in terms of risk
management, flexibility, and diversity, showcasing outstanding performance in
simulating a wide range of realistic, high-risk traffic scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17487v1,,False
A Temporal Convolutional Network-based Approach for Network Intrusion Detection,23/12/2024,"Rukmini Nazre, Rujuta Budke, Omkar Oak, Suraj Sawant, Amit Joshi","Network intrusion detection is critical for securing modern networks, yet the
complexity of network traffic poses significant challenges to traditional
methods. This study proposes a Temporal Convolutional Network(TCN) model

On the Feasibility of Vision-Language Models for Time-Series Classification,23/12/2024,"Vinay Prithyani, Mohsin Mohammed, Richa Gadgil, Ricardo Buitrago, Vinija Jain, Aman Chadha","We build upon time-series classification by leveraging the capabilities of
Vision Language Models (VLMs). We find that VLMs produce competitive results

representations can provide additional contextual information that numerical
data alone may not capture. Additionally, providing a graphical representation
can circumvent issues such as limited context length faced by LLMs. To further
advance this work, we implemented a scalable end-to-end pipeline for training
on different scenarios, allowing us to isolate the most effective strategies

Foundation Model for Lossy Compression of Spatiotemporal Scientific Data,22/12/2024,"Xiao Li, Jaemoon Lee, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka","We present a foundation model (FM) for lossy scientific data compression,
combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a hyper-prior structure and a
super-resolution (SR) module. The VAE framework uses hyper-priors to model
latent space dependencies, enhancing compression efficiency. The SR module
refines low-resolution representations into high-resolution outputs, improving
reconstruction quality. By alternating between 2D and 3D convolutions, the
model efficiently captures spatiotemporal correlations in scientific data while
maintaining low computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that the
FM generalizes well to unseen domains and varying data shapes, achieving up to
4 times higher compression ratios than state-of-the-art methods after

Enhancing Item Tokenization for Generative Recommendation through Self-Improvement,22/12/2024,"Runjin Chen, Mingxuan Ju, Ngoc Bui, Dimosthenis Antypas, Stanley Cai, Xiaopeng Wu, Leonardo Neves, Zhangyang Wang, Neil Shah, Tong Zhao","Generative recommendation systems, driven by large language models (LLMs),
present an innovative approach to predicting user preferences by modeling items
as token sequences and generating recommendations in a generative manner. A
critical challenge in this approach is the effective tokenization of items,
ensuring that they are represented in a form compatible with LLMs. Current item
tokenization methods include using text descriptions, numerical strings, or
sequences of discrete tokens. While text-based representations integrate
seamlessly with LLM tokenization, they are often too lengthy, leading to
inefficiencies and complicating accurate generation. Numerical strings, while
concise, lack semantic depth and fail to capture meaningful item relationships.
Tokenizing items as sequences of newly defined tokens has gained traction, but
it often requires external models or algorithms for token assignment. These
external processes may not align with the LLM's internal pretrained
tokenization schema, leading to inconsistencies and reduced model performance.
To address these limitations, we propose a self-improving item tokenization
method that allows the LLM to refine its own item tokenizations during training
process. Our approach starts with item tokenizations generated by any external
model and periodically adjusts these tokenizations based on the LLM's learned
patterns. Such alignment process ensures consistency between the tokenization
and the LLM's internal understanding of the items, leading to more accurate
recommendations. Furthermore, our method is simple to implement and can be
integrated as a plug-and-play enhancement into existing generative
recommendation systems. Experimental results on multiple datasets and using
various initial tokenization strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method, with an average improvement of 8\% in recommendation performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.17171v1,,False
LLM Agent for Fire Dynamics Simulations,22/12/2024,"Leidong Xu, Danyal Mohaddes, Yi Wang","Significant advances have been achieved in leveraging foundation models, such

ASP-based Multi-shot Reasoning via DLV2 with Incremental Grounding,22/12/2024,"Francesco Calimeri, Giovambattista Ianni, Francesco Pacenza, Simona Perri, Jessica Zanfari","DLV2 is an AI tool for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning which supports
Answer Set Programming (ASP) - a logic-based declarative formalism,
successfully used in both academic and industrial applications. Given a logic
program modelling a computational problem, an execution of DLV2 produces the
so-called answer sets that correspond one-to-one to the solutions to the
problem at hand. The computational process of DLV2 relies on the typical Ground
& Solve approach where the grounding step transforms the input program into a
new, equivalent ground program, and the subsequent solving step applies
propositional algorithms to search for the answer sets. Recently, emerging
applications in contexts such as stream reasoning and event processing created
a demand for multi-shot reasoning: here, the system is expected to be reactive
while repeatedly executed over rapidly changing data. In this work, we present
a new incremental reasoner obtained from the evolution of DLV2 towards iterated
reasoning. Rather than restarting the computation from scratch, the system
remains alive across repeated shots, and it incrementally handles the internal
grounding process. At each shot, the system reuses previous computations for
building and maintaining a large, more general ground program, from which a
smaller yet equivalent portion is determined and used for computing answer

System-2 Mathematical Reasoning via Enriched Instruction Tuning,22/12/2024,"Huanqia Cai, Yijun Yang, Zhifeng Li","Solving complex mathematical problems via system-2 reasoning is a natural
human skill, yet it remains a significant challenge for current large language
models (LLMs). We identify the scarcity of deliberate multi-step reasoning data
as a primary limiting factor. To this end, we introduce Enriched Instruction
Tuning (EIT), a method that enriches existing human-annotated mathematical
datasets by synergizing human and AI feedback to create fine-grained reasoning
trajectories. These datasets are then used to fine-tune open-source LLMs,
enhancing their mathematical reasoning abilities without reliance on any

instructions into a sequence of simpler objectives, while ERS fills in
reasoning contexts often overlooked by human annotators, creating a smoother
reasoning trajectory for LLM fine-tuning. Unlike existing CoT prompting methods
that generate reasoning chains only depending on LLM's internal knowledge, our
method leverages human-annotated initial answers as ``meta-knowledge'' to help
LLMs generate more detailed and precise reasoning processes, leading to a more
trustworthy LLM expert for complex mathematical problems. In experiments, EIT

Learning to Generate Gradients for Test-Time Adaptation via Test-Time Training Layers,22/12/2024,"Qi Deng, Shuaicheng Niu, Ronghao Zhang, Yaofo Chen, Runhao Zeng, Jian Chen, Xiping Hu","Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to fine-tune a trained model online using
unlabeled testing data to adapt to new environments or out-of-distribution
data, demonstrating broad application potential in real-world scenarios.
However, in this optimization process, unsupervised learning objectives like
entropy minimization frequently encounter noisy learning signals. These signals
produce unreliable gradients, which hinder the model ability to converge to an
optimal solution quickly and introduce significant instability into the
optimization process. In this paper, we seek to resolve these issues from the
perspective of optimizer design. Unlike prior TTA using manually designed
optimizers like SGD, we employ a learning-to-optimize approach to automatically
learn an optimizer, called Meta Gradient Generator (MGG). Specifically, we aim
for MGG to effectively utilize historical gradient information during the
online optimization process to optimize the current model. To this end, in MGG,
we design a lightweight and efficient sequence modeling layer -- gradient
memory layer. It exploits a self-supervised reconstruction loss to compress
historical gradient information into network parameters, thereby enabling
better memorization ability over a long-term adaptation process. We only need a
small number of unlabeled samples to pre-train MGG, and then the trained MGG
can be deployed to process unseen samples. Promising results on ImageNet-C, R,
Sketch, and A indicate that our method surpasses current state-of-the-art

Integrating Random Effects in Variational Autoencoders for Dimensionality Reduction of Correlated Data,22/12/2024,"Giora Simchoni, Saharon Rosset","Variational Autoencoders (VAE) are widely used for dimensionality reduction

independent as usual, the random part consists of latent variables which are
correlated between similar clusters in the data such as nearby locations or

Preventing Non-intrusive Load Monitoring Privacy Invasion: A Precise Adversarial Attack Scheme for Networked Smart Meters,22/12/2024,"Jialing He, Jiacheng Wang, Ning Wang, Shangwei Guo, Liehuang Zhu, Dusit Niyato, Tao Xiang","Smart grid, through networked smart meters employing the non-intrusive load
monitoring (NILM) technique, can considerably discern the usage patterns of
residential appliances. However, this technique also incurs privacy leakage. To
address this issue, we propose an innovative scheme based on adversarial attack
in this paper. The scheme effectively prevents NILM models from violating
appliance-level privacy, while also ensuring accurate billing calculation for
users. To achieve this objective, we overcome two primary challenges. First, as
NILM models fall under the category of time-series regression models, direct
application of traditional adversarial attacks designed for classification
tasks is not feasible. To tackle this issue, we formulate a novel adversarial
attack problem tailored specifically for NILM and providing a theoretical
foundation for utilizing the Jacobian of the NILM model to generate
imperceptible perturbations. Leveraging the Jacobian, our scheme can produce
perturbations, which effectively misleads the signal prediction of NILM models
to safeguard users' appliance-level privacy. The second challenge pertains to
fundamental utility requirements, where existing adversarial attack schemes
struggle to achieve accurate billing calculation for users. To handle this
problem, we introduce an additional constraint, mandating that the sum of added
perturbations within a billing period must be precisely zero. Experimental
validation on real-world power datasets REDD and UK-DALE demonstrates the
efficacy of our proposed solutions, which can significantly amplify the
discrepancy between the output of the targeted NILM model and the actual power
signal of appliances, and enable accurate billing at the same time.
Additionally, our solutions exhibit transferability, making the generated
perturbation signal from one target model applicable to other diverse NILM
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16893v1,,False
Sim911: Towards Effective and Equitable 9-1-1 Dispatcher Training with an LLM-Enabled Simulation,22/12/2024,"Zirong Chen, Elizabeth Chason, Noah Mladenovski, Erin Wilson, Kristin Mullen, Stephen Martini, Meiyi Ma","Emergency response services are vital for enhancing public safety by
safeguarding the environment, property, and human lives. As frontline members
of these services, 9-1-1 dispatchers have a direct impact on response times and
the overall effectiveness of emergency operations. However, traditional
dispatcher training methods, which rely on role-playing by experienced
personnel, are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and often neglect the specific
needs of underserved communities. To address these challenges, we introduce
Sim911, the first training simulation for 9-1-1 dispatchers powered by Large
Language Models (LLMs). Sim911 enhances training through three key technical
innovations: (1) knowledge construction, which utilizes archived 9-1-1 call
data to generate simulations that closely mirror real-world scenarios; (2)
context-aware controlled generation, which employs dynamic prompts and vector
bases to ensure that LLM behavior aligns with training objectives; and (3)
validation with looped correction, which filters out low-quality responses and
refines the system performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16844v1,,False
Algorithm Design for Continual Learning in IoT Networks,22/12/2024,"Shugang Hao, Lingjie Duan","Continual learning (CL) is a new online learning technique over sequentially
generated streaming data from different tasks, aiming to maintain a small
forgetting loss on previously-learned tasks. Existing work focuses on reducing
the forgetting loss under a given task sequence. However, if similar tasks
continuously appear to the end time, the forgetting loss is still huge on prior
distinct tasks. In practical IoT networks, an autonomous vehicle to sample data
and learn different tasks can route and alter the order of task pattern at
increased travelling cost. To our best knowledge, we are the first to study how
to opportunistically route the testing object and alter the task sequence in
CL. We formulate a new optimization problem and prove it NP-hard. We propose a
polynomial-time algorithm to achieve approximation ratios of $\frac{3}{2}$ for
underparameterized case and $\frac{3}{2} + r^{1-T}$ for overparameterized case,
respectively, where $r:=1-\frac{n}{m}$ is a parameter of feature number $m$ and
sample number $n$ and $T$ is the task number. Simulation results verify our
algorithm's close-to-optimum performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16830v1,,False
Bi-Sparse Unsupervised Feature Selection,22/12/2024,"Xianchao Xiu, Chenyi Huang, Pan Shang, Wanquan Liu","To efficiently deal with high-dimensional datasets in many areas,
unsupervised feature selection (UFS) has become a rising technique for
dimension reduction. Even though there are many UFS methods, most of them only
consider the global structure of datasets by embedding a single sparse
regularization or constraint. In this paper, we introduce a novel bi-sparse UFS
method, called BSUFS, to simultaneously characterize both global and local
structures. The core idea of BSUFS is to incorporate $\ell_{2,p}$-norm and
$\ell_q$-norm into the classical principal component analysis (PCA), which
enables our proposed method to select relevant features and filter out
irrelevant noise accurately. Here, the parameters $p$ and $q$ are within the
range of [0,1). Therefore, BSUFS not only constructs a unified framework for
bi-sparse optimization, but also includes some existing works as special cases.
To solve the resulting non-convex model, we propose an efficient proximal
alternating minimization (PAM) algorithm using Riemannian manifold optimization
and sparse optimization techniques. Theoretically, PAM is proven to have global
convergence, i.e., for any random initial point, the generated sequence
converges to a critical point that satisfies the first-order optimality
condition. Extensive numerical experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed BSUFS. Specifically, the average
accuracy (ACC) is improved by at least 4.71% and the normalized mutual
information (NMI) is improved by at least 3.14% on average compared to the
existing UFS competitors. The results validate the advantages of bi-sparse
optimization in feature selection and show its potential for other fields in
image processing. Our code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.16819v1,,False
