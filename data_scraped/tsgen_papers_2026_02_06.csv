PhysicsAgentABM: Physics-Guided Generative Agent-Based Modeling,05/02/2026,"Kavana Venkatesh, Yinhan He, Jundong Li, Jiaming Cui","Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems enable expressive agent reasoning but are expensive to scale and poorly calibrated for timestep-aligned state-transition simulation, while classical agent-based models (ABMs) offer interpretability but struggle to integrate rich individual-level signals and non-stationary behaviors. We propose PhysicsAgentABM, which shifts inference to behaviorally coherent agent clusters: state-specialized symbolic agents encode mechanistic transition priors, a multimodal neural transition model captures temporal and interaction dynamics, and uncertainty-aware epistemic fusion yields calibrated cluster-level transition distributions. Individual agents then stochastically realize transitions under local constraints, decoupling population inference from entity-level variability. We further introduce ANCHOR, an LLM agent-driven clustering strategy based on cross-contextual behavioral responses and a novel contrastive loss, reducing LLM calls by up to 6-8 times. Experiments across public health, finance, and social sciences show consistent gains in event-time accuracy and calibration over mechanistic, neural, and LLM baselines. By re-architecting generative ABM around population-level inference with uncertainty-aware neuro-symbolic fusion, PhysicsAgentABM establishes a new paradigm for scalable and calibrated simulation with LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.06030v1,,False
Diamond Maps: Efficient Reward Alignment via Stochastic Flow Maps,05/02/2026,"Peter Holderrieth, Douglas Chen, Luca Eyring, Ishin Shah, Giri Anantharaman, Yutong He, Zeynep Akata, Tommi Jaakkola, Nicholas Matthew Boffi, Max Simchowitz","Flow and diffusion models produce high-quality samples, but adapting them to user preferences or constraints post-training remains costly and brittle, a challenge commonly called reward alignment. We argue that efficient reward alignment should be a property of the generative model itself, not an afterthought, and redesign the model for adaptability. We propose ""Diamond Maps"", stochastic flow map models that enable efficient and accurate alignment to arbitrary rewards at inference time. Diamond Maps amortize many simulation steps into a single-step sampler, like flow maps, while preserving the stochasticity required for optimal reward alignment. This design makes search, sequential Monte Carlo, and guidance scalable by enabling efficient and consistent estimation of the value function. Our experiments show that Diamond Maps can be learned efficiently via distillation from GLASS Flows, achieve stronger reward alignment performance, and scale better than existing methods. Our results point toward a practical route to generative models that can be rapidly adapted to arbitrary preferences and constraints at inference time.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05993v1,,False
RISE-Video: Can Video Generators Decode Implicit World Rules?,05/02/2026,"Mingxin Liu, Shuran Ma, Shibei Meng, Xiangyu Zhao, Zicheng Zhang, Shaofeng Zhang, Zhihang Zhong, Peixian Chen, Haoyu Cao, Xing Sun, Haodong Duan, Xue Yang","While generative video models have achieved remarkable visual fidelity, their capacity to internalize and reason over implicit world rules remains a critical yet under-explored frontier. To bridge this gap, we present RISE-Video, a pioneering reasoning-oriented benchmark for Text-Image-to-Video (TI2V) synthesis that shifts the evaluative focus from surface-level aesthetics to deep cognitive reasoning. RISE-Video comprises 467 meticulously human-annotated samples spanning eight rigorous categories, providing a structured testbed for probing model intelligence across diverse dimensions, ranging from commonsense and spatial dynamics to specialized subject domains. Our framework introduces a multi-dimensional evaluation protocol consisting of four metrics: \textit{Reasoning Alignment}, \textit{Temporal Consistency}, \textit{Physical Rationality}, and \textit{Visual Quality}. To further support scalable evaluation, we propose an automated pipeline leveraging Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to emulate human-centric assessment.

A Hybrid Data-Driven Algorithm for Real-Time Friction Force Estimation in Hydraulic Cylinders,05/02/2026,"Mohamad Amin Jamshidi, Mehrbod Zarifi, Zolfa Anvari, Hamed Ghafarirad, Mohammad Zareinejad","Hydraulic systems are widely utilized in industrial applications due to their high force generation, precise control, and ability to function in harsh environments. Hydraulic cylinders, as actuators in these systems, apply force and position through the displacement of hydraulic fluid, but their operation is significantly influenced by friction force. Achieving precision in hydraulic cylinders requires an accurate friction model under various operating conditions. Existing analytical models, often derived from experimental tests, necessitate the identification or estimation of influencing factors but are limited in adaptability and computational efficiency. This research introduces a data-driven, hybrid algorithm based on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks and Random Forests for nonlinear friction force estimation. The algorithm effectively combines feature detection and estimation processes using training data acquired from an experimental hydraulic test setup. It achieves a consistent and stable model error of less than 10% across diverse operating conditions and external load variations, ensuring robust performance in complex situations. The computational cost of the algorithm is 1.51 milliseconds per estimation, making it suitable for real-time applications. The proposed method addresses the limitations of analytical models by delivering high precision and computational efficiency. The algorithm's performance is validated through detailed analysis and experimental results, including direct comparisons with the LuGre model. The comparison highlights that while the LuGre model offers a theoretical foundation for friction modeling, its performance is limited by its inability to dynamically adjust to varying operational conditions of the hydraulic cylinder, further emphasizing the advantages of the proposed hybrid approach in real-time applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05967v1,10.1109/ICEE67339.2025.11213926,False
Verification of the Implicit World Model in a Generative Model via Adversarial Sequences,05/02/2026,"András Balogh, Márk Jelasity","Generative sequence models are typically trained on sample sequences from natural or formal languages. It is a crucial question whether -- or to what extent -- sample-based training is able to capture the true structure of these languages, often referred to as the ``world model''. Theoretical results indicate that we can hope for soundness at best, that is, generating valid sequences, but not necessarily all of them. However, it is still important to have practical tools that are able to verify whether a given sequence model is sound. In this study, we focus on chess, as it is a domain that provides enough complexity while having a simple rule-based world model. We propose adversarial sequence generation for verifying the soundness of the sequence model. Our adversaries generate valid sequences so as to force the sequence model to generate an invalid next move prediction. Apart from the falsification of soundness, this method is also suitable for a more fine-grained analysis of the failure modes and the effects of different choices during training. To demonstrate this, we propose a number of methods for adversarial sequence generation and evaluate the approach on a large set of chess models. We train models on random as well as high-quality chess games, using several training recipes. We find that none of the models are sound, but some training techniques and dataset choices are able to improve soundness remarkably. We also investigate the potential application of board state probes in both our training and attack methods. Our findings indicate that the extracted board states have no causal role in next token prediction in most of the models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05903v1,,False
Escaping Local Minima Provably in Non-convex Matrix Sensing: A Deterministic Framework via Simulated Lifting,05/02/2026,"Tianqi Shen, Jinji Yang, Junze He, Kunhan Gao, Ziye Ma","Low-rank matrix sensing is a fundamental yet challenging nonconvex problem whose optimization landscape typically contains numerous spurious local minima, making it difficult for gradient-based optimizers to converge to the global optimum. Recent work has shown that over-parameterization via tensor lifting can convert such local minima into strict saddle points, an insight that also partially explains why massive scaling can improve generalization and performance in modern machine learning. Motivated by this observation, we propose a Simulated Oracle Direction (SOD) escape mechanism that simulates the landscape and escape direction of the over-parametrized space, without resorting to actually lifting the problem, since that would be computationally intractable. In essence, we designed a mathematical framework to project over-parametrized escape directions onto the original parameter space to guarantee a strict decrease of objective value from existing local minima. To the best of the our knowledge, this represents the first deterministic framework that could escape spurious local minima with guarantee, especially without using random perturbations or heuristic estimates. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our framework reliably escapes local minima and facilitates convergence to global optima, while incurring minimal computational cost when compared to explicit tensor over-parameterization. We believe this framework has non-trivial implications for nonconvex optimization beyond matrix sensing, by showcasing how simulated over-parameterization can be leveraged to tame challenging optimization landscapes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05887v1,,False
Large-scale Score-based Variational Posterior Inference for Bayesian Deep Neural Networks,05/02/2026,Minyoung Kim,"Bayesian (deep) neural networks (BNN) are often more attractive than the mainstream point-estimate vanilla deep learning in various aspects including uncertainty quantification, robustness to noise, resistance to overfitting, and more. The variational inference (VI) is one of the most widely adopted approximate inference methods. Whereas the ELBO-based variational free energy method is a dominant choice in the literature, in this paper we introduce a score-based alternative for BNN variational inference. Although there have been quite a few score-based variational inference methods proposed in the community, most are not adequate for large-scale BNNs for various computational and technical reasons. We propose a novel scalable VI method where the learning objective combines the score matching loss and the proximal penalty term in iterations, which helps our method avoid the reparametrized sampling, and allows for noisy unbiased mini-batch scores through stochastic gradients. This in turn makes our method scalable to large-scale neural networks including Vision Transformers, and allows for richer variational density families. On several benchmarks including visual recognition and time-series forecasting with large-scale deep networks, we empirically show the effectiveness of our approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05873v1,,False
A Hybrid Autoencoder for Robust Heightmap Generation from Fused Lidar and Depth Data for Humanoid Robot Locomotion,05/02/2026,"Dennis Bank, Joost Cordes, Thomas Seel, Simon F. G. Ehlers","Reliable terrain perception is a critical prerequisite for the deployment of humanoid robots in unstructured, human-centric environments. While traditional systems often rely on manually engineered, single-sensor pipelines, this paper presents a learning-based framework that uses an intermediate, robot-centric heightmap representation. A hybrid Encoder-Decoder Structure (EDS) is introduced, utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction fused with a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) core for temporal consistency. The architecture integrates multimodal data from an Intel RealSense depth camera, a LIVOX MID-360 LiDAR processed via efficient spherical projection, and an onboard IMU. Quantitative results demonstrate that multimodal fusion improves reconstruction accuracy by 7.2% over depth-only and 9.9% over LiDAR-only configurations. Furthermore, the integration of a 3.2 s temporal context reduces mapping drift.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05855v1,,False
Variational Speculative Decoding: Rethinking Draft Training from Token Likelihood to Sequence Acceptance,05/02/2026,"Xiandong Zou, Jianshu Li, Jing Huang, Pan Zhou","Speculative decoding accelerates inference for (M)LLMs, yet a training-decoding discrepancy persists: while existing methods optimize single greedy trajectories, decoding involves verifying and ranking multiple sampled draft paths. We propose Variational Speculative Decoding (VSD), formulating draft training as variational inference over latent proposals (draft paths). VSD maximizes the marginal probability of target-model acceptance, yielding an ELBO that promotes high-quality latent proposals while minimizing divergence from the target distribution. To enhance quality and reduce variance, we incorporate a path-level utility and optimize via an Expectation-Maximization procedure. The E-step draws MCMC samples from an oracle-filtered posterior, while the M-step maximizes weighted likelihood using Adaptive Rejection Weighting (ARW) and Confidence-Aware Regularization (CAR). Theoretical analysis confirms that VSD increases expected acceptance length and speedup. Extensive experiments across LLMs and MLLMs show that VSD achieves up to a 9.6% speedup over EAGLE-3 and 7.9% over ViSpec, significantly improving decoding efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05774v1,,False
RL-VLA$^3$: Reinforcement Learning VLA Accelerating via Full Asynchronism,05/02/2026,"Zhong Guan, Haoran Sun, Yongjian Guo, Shuai Di, Xiaodong Bai, Jing Long, Tianyun Zhao, Mingxi Luo, Chen Zhou, Yucheng Guo, Qiming Yang, Wanting Xu, Wen Huang, Yunxuan Ma, Hongke Zhao, Likang Wu, Xiaotie Deng, Xi Xiao, Sheng Wen, Yicheng Gong, Junwu Xiong","In recent years, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a crucial pathway towards general embodied intelligence, yet their training efficiency has become a key bottleneck. Although existing reinforcement learning (RL)-based training frameworks like RLinf can enhance model generalization, they still rely on synchronous execution, leading to severe resource underutilization and throughput limitations during environment interaction, policy generation (rollout), and model update phases (actor). To overcome this challenge, this paper, for the first time, proposes and implements a fully-asynchronous policy training framework encompassing the entire pipeline from environment interaction, rollout generation, to actor policy updates. Systematically drawing inspiration from asynchronous optimization ideas in large model RL, our framework designs a multi-level decoupled architecture. This includes asynchronous parallelization of environment interaction and trajectory collection, streaming execution for policy generation, and decoupled scheduling for training updates. We validated the effectiveness of our method across diverse VLA models and environments. On the LIBERO benchmark, the framework achieves throughput improvements of up to 59.25\% compared to existing synchronous strategies. When deeply optimizing separation strategies, throughput can be increased by as much as 126.67\%. We verified the effectiveness of each asynchronous component via ablation studies. Scaling law validation across 8 to 256 GPUs demonstrates our method's excellent scalability under most conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05765v1,,False
Determining Energy Efficiency Sweet Spots in Production LLM Inference,05/02/2026,"Hiari Pizzini Cavagna, Andrea Proia, Giacomo Madella, Giovanni B. Esposito, Francesco Antici, Daniele Cesarini, Zeynep Kiziltan, Andrea Bartolini","Large Language Models (LLMs) inference is central in modern AI applications, making it critical to understand their energy footprint. Existing approaches typically estimate energy consumption through simple linear functions of input and output sequence lengths, yet our observations reveal clear Energy Efficiency regimes: peak efficiency occurs with short-to-moderate inputs and medium-length outputs, while efficiency drops sharply for long inputs or very short outputs, indicating a non-linear dependency. In this work, we propose an analytical model derived from the computational and memory-access complexity of the Transformer architecture, capable of accurately characterizing the efficiency curve as a function of input and output lengths. To assess its accuracy, we evaluate energy consumption using TensorRT-LLM on NVIDIA H100 GPUs across a diverse set of LLMs ranging from 1B to 9B parameters, including OPT, LLaMA, Gemma, Falcon, Qwen2, and Granite, tested over input and output lengths from 64 to 4096 tokens, achieving a mean MAPE of 1.79%. Our results show that aligning sequence lengths with these efficiency ""Sweet Spots"" can substantially reduce energy usage, supporting informed truncation, summarization, and adaptive generation strategies in production systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05695v1,,False
Probabilistic Multi-Regional Solar Power Forecasting with Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Networks,05/02/2026,"Slawek Smyl, Paweł Pełka, Grzegorz Dudek","The increasing penetration of photovoltaic (PV) generation introduces significant uncertainty into power system operation, necessitating forecasting approaches that extend beyond deterministic point predictions. This paper proposes an any-quantile probabilistic forecasting framework for multi-regional PV power generation based on the Any-Quantile Recurrent Neural Network (AQ-RNN). The model integrates an any-quantile forecasting paradigm with a dual-track recurrent architecture that jointly processes series-specific and cross-regional contextual information, supported by dilated recurrent cells, patch-based temporal modeling, and a dynamic ensemble mechanism.
  The proposed framework enables the estimation of calibrated conditional quantiles at arbitrary probability levels within a single trained model and effectively exploits spatial dependencies to enhance robustness at the system level. The approach is evaluated using 30 years of hourly PV generation data from 259 European regions and compared against established statistical and neural probabilistic baselines. The results demonstrate consistent improvements in forecast accuracy, calibration, and prediction interval quality, underscoring the suitability of the proposed method for uncertainty-aware energy management and operational decision-making in renewable-dominated power systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05660v1,,False
Empowering Time Series Analysis with Large-Scale Multimodal Pretraining,05/02/2026,"Peng Chen, Siyuan Wang, Shiyan Hu, Xingjian Wu, Yang Shu, Zhongwen Rao, Meng Wang, Yijie Li, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo","While existing time series foundation models primarily rely on large-scale unimodal pretraining, they lack complementary modalities to enhance time series understanding. Building multimodal foundation models is a natural next step, but it faces key challenges: 1) lack of a unified multimodal pretraining paradigm and large-scale multimodal corpora for time series analysis; 2) how to effectively integrate heterogeneous modalities and enhance model generalization. To address these challenges, we take an early step toward multimodal foundation models for time series analysis. We first propose a multimodal pretraining paradigm that leverages time series with endogenous modalities (derived images and text) and exogenous knowledge (real-world news), providing a comprehensive multi-view perspective for time series analysis. To support this, we develop an automated data construction pipeline to curate MM-TS, the first large-scale multimodal time series dataset spanning six domains, with up to one billion points. Then we propose HORAI, a frequency-enhanced multimodal foundation model. It integrates two core components: the Frequency-enhanced Cross-Modality Encoder and the Time-Frequency Decoder, designed to effectively fuse multimodal features and enhance model generalization across modalities and domains. After pretraining on MM-TS, HORAI achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on time series forecasting and anomaly detection tasks, demonstrating strong generalization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05646v1,,False
Conditional Diffusion Guidance under Hard Constraint: A Stochastic Analysis Approach,05/02/2026,"Zhengyi Guo, Wenpin Tang, Renyuan Xu","We study conditional generation in diffusion models under hard constraints, where generated samples must satisfy prescribed events with probability one. Such constraints arise naturally in safety-critical applications and in rare-event simulation, where soft or reward-based guidance methods offer no guarantee of constraint satisfaction. Building on a probabilistic interpretation of diffusion models, we develop a principled conditional diffusion guidance framework based on Doob's h-transform, martingale representation and quadratic variation process. Specifically, the resulting guided dynamics augment a pretrained diffusion with an explicit drift correction involving the logarithmic gradient of a conditioning function, without modifying the pretrained score network. Leveraging martingale and quadratic-variation identities, we propose two novel off-policy learning algorithms based on a martingale loss and a martingale-covariation loss to estimate h and its gradient using only trajectories from the pretrained model. We provide non-asymptotic guarantees for the resulting conditional sampler in both total variation and Wasserstein distances, explicitly characterizing the impact of score approximation and guidance estimation errors. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in enforcing hard constraints and generating rare-event samples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05533v1,,False
LinguistAgent: A Reflective Multi-Model Platform for Automated Linguistic Annotation,05/02/2026,Bingru Li,"Data annotation remains a significant bottleneck in the Humanities and Social Sciences, particularly for complex semantic tasks such as metaphor identification.

Attention Retention for Continual Learning with Vision Transformers,05/02/2026,"Yue Lu, Xiangyu Zhou, Shizhou Zhang, Yinghui Xing, Guoqiang Liang, Wencong Zhang","Continual learning (CL) empowers AI systems to progressively acquire knowledge from non-stationary data streams. However, catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge. In this work, we identify attention drift in Vision Transformers as a primary source of catastrophic forgetting, where the attention to previously learned visual concepts shifts significantly after learning new tasks. Inspired by neuroscientific insights into the selective attention in the human visual system, we propose a novel attention-retaining framework to mitigate forgetting in CL. Our method constrains attention drift by explicitly modifying gradients during backpropagation through a two-step process: 1) extracting attention maps of the previous task using a layer-wise rollout mechanism and generating instance-adaptive binary masks, and 2) when learning a new task, applying these masks to zero out gradients associated with previous attention regions, thereby preventing disruption of learned visual concepts. For compatibility with modern optimizers, the gradient masking process is further enhanced by scaling parameter updates proportionally to maintain their relative magnitudes. Experiments and visualizations demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in mitigating catastrophic forgetting and preserving visual concepts. It achieves state-of-the-art performance and exhibits robust generalizability across diverse CL scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05454v1,,False
Day-Ahead Electricity Price Forecasting for Volatile Markets Using Foundation Models with Regularization Strategy,05/02/2026,"Kritchanat Ponyuenyong, Pengyu Tu, Jia Wei Tan, Wei Soon Cheong, Jamie Ng Suat Ling, Lianlian Jiang","Electricity price forecasting (EPF) is essential for energy markets stakeholders (e.g. grid operators, energy traders, policymakers) but remains challenging due to the inherent volatility and nonlinearity of price signals. Traditional statistical and deep learning (DL) models often struggle to capture complex temporal dependencies and integrate heterogeneous data effectively. While time series foundation models (TSFMs) have shown strong performance in general time series forecasting tasks, such as traffic forecasting and weather forecasting. However, their effectiveness in day-ahead EPF, particularly in volatile markets, remains underexplored. This paper presents a spike regularization strategy and evaluates a wide range of TSFMs, including Tiny Time Mixers (TTMs), MOIRAI, MOMENT, and TimesFM, against traditional statistical and DL models such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long-short Term Memory (LSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network - LSTM (CNN-LSTM) using half-hourly wholesale market data with volatile trends in Singapore. Exogenous factors (e.g. weather and calendar variables) are also incorporated into models where applicable. Results demonstrate that TSFMs consistently outperform traditional approaches, achieving up to 37.4% improvement in MAPE across various evaluation settings.

H-AdminSim: A Multi-Agent Simulator for Realistic Hospital Administrative Workflows with FHIR Integration,05/02/2026,"Jun-Min Lee, Meong Hi Son, Edward Choi","Hospital administration departments handle a wide range of operational tasks and, in large hospitals, process over 10,000 requests per day, driving growing interest in LLM-based automation.

These tasks are quantitatively evaluated using detailed rubrics, enabling systematic comparison of LLMs. Through FHIR integration, H-AdminSim provides a unified and interoperable environment for testing administrative workflows across heterogeneous hospital settings, serving as a standardized testbed for assessing the feasibility and performance of LLM-driven administrative automation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05407v1,,False
A Decomposition-based State Space Model for Multivariate Time-Series Forecasting,05/02/2026,"Shunya Nagashima, Shuntaro Suzuki, Shuitsu Koyama, Shinnosuke Hirano","Multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for decision-making in domains such as weather, energy, and finance.

To address this, we propose ProAct, a framework that enables agents to internalize accurate lookahead reasoning through a two-stage training paradigm. First, we introduce Grounded LookAhead Distillation (GLAD), where the agent undergoes supervised fine-tuning on trajectories derived from environment-based search. By compressing complex search trees into concise, causal reasoning chains, the agent learns the logic of foresight without the computational overhead of inference-time search. Second, to further refine decision accuracy, we propose the Monte-Carlo Critic (MC-Critic), a plug-and-play auxiliary value estimator designed to enhance policy-gradient algorithms like PPO and GRPO. By leveraging lightweight environment rollouts to calibrate value estimates, MC-Critic provides a low-variance signal that facilitates stable policy optimization without relying on expensive model-based value approximation. Experiments on both stochastic (e.g., 2048) and deterministic (e.g., Sokoban) environments demonstrate that ProAct significantly improves planning accuracy.

Accelerated Sequential Flow Matching: A Bayesian Filtering Perspective,05/02/2026,"Yinan Huang, Hans Hao-Hsun Hsu, Junran Wang, Bo Dai, Pan Li","Sequential prediction from streaming observations is a fundamental problem in stochastic dynamical systems, where inherent uncertainty often leads to multiple plausible futures. While diffusion and flow-matching models are capable of modeling complex, multi-modal trajectories, their deployment in real-time streaming environments typically relies on repeated sampling from a non-informative initial distribution, incurring substantial inference latency and potential system backlogs. In this work, we introduce Sequential Flow Matching, a principled framework grounded in Bayesian filtering. By treating streaming inference as learning a probability flow that transports the predictive distribution from one time step to the next, our approach naturally aligns with the recursive structure of Bayesian belief updates. We provide theoretical justification that initializing generation from the previous posterior offers a principled warm start that can accelerate sampling compared to naïve re-sampling. Across a wide range of forecasting, decision-making and state estimation tasks, our method achieves performance competitive with full-step diffusion while requiring only one or very few sampling steps, therefore with faster sampling. It suggests that framing sequential inference via Bayesian filtering provides a new and principled perspective towards efficient real-time deployment of flow-based models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05319v1,,False
Position: Universal Time Series Foundation Models Rest on a Category Error,05/02/2026,"Xilin Dai, Wanxu Cai, Zhijian Xu, Qiang Xu","This position paper argues that the pursuit of ""Universal Foundation Models for Time Series"" rests on a fundamental category error, mistaking a structural Container for a semantic Modality. We contend that because time series hold incompatible generative processes (e.g., finance vs. fluid dynamics), monolithic models degenerate into expensive ""Generic Filters"" that fail to generalize under distributional drift. To address this, we introduce the ""Autoregressive Blindness Bound,"" a theoretical limit proving that history-only models cannot predict intervention-driven regime shifts. We advocate replacing universality with a Causal Control Agent paradigm, where an agent leverages external context to orchestrate a hierarchy of specialized solvers, from frozen domain experts to lightweight Just-in-Time adaptors.

Robust Inference-Time Steering of Protein Diffusion Models via Embedding Optimization,05/02/2026,"Minhuan Li, Jiequn Han, Pilar Cossio, Luhuan Wu","In many biophysical inverse problems, the goal is to generate biomolecular conformations that are both physically plausible and consistent with experimental measurements. As recent sequence-to-structure diffusion models provide powerful data-driven priors, posterior sampling has emerged as a popular framework by guiding atomic coordinates to target conformations using experimental likelihoods. However, when the target lies in a low-density region of the prior, posterior sampling requires aggressive and brittle weighting of the likelihood guidance. Motivated by this limitation, we propose EmbedOpt, an alternative inference-time approach for steering diffusion models to optimize experimental likelihoods in the conditional embedding space. As this space encodes rich sequence and coevolutionary signals, optimizing over it effectively shifts the diffusion prior to align with experimental constraints. We validate EmbedOpt on two benchmarks simulating cryo-electron microscopy map fitting and experimental distance constraints. We show that EmbedOpt outperforms the coordinate-based posterior sampling method in map fitting tasks, matches performance on distance constraint tasks, and exhibits superior engineering robustness across hyperparameters spanning two orders of magnitude. Moreover, its smooth optimization behavior enables a significant reduction in the number of diffusion steps required for inference, leading to better efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05285v1,,False
ZeroS: Zero-Sum Linear Attention for Efficient Transformers,05/02/2026,"Jiecheng Lu, Xu Han, Yan Sun, Viresh Pati, Yubin Kim, Siddhartha Somani, Shihao Yang","Linear attention methods offer Transformers $O(N)$ complexity but typically underperform standard softmax attention. We identify two fundamental limitations affecting these approaches: the restriction to convex combinations that only permits additive information blending, and uniform accumulated weight bias that dilutes attention in long contexts. We propose Zero-Sum Linear Attention (ZeroS), which addresses these limitations by removing the constant zero-order term $1/t$ and reweighting the remaining zero-sum softmax residuals. This modification creates mathematically stable weights, enabling both positive and negative values and allowing a single attention layer to perform contrastive operations. While maintaining $O(N)$ complexity, ZeroS theoretically expands the set of representable functions compared to convex combinations. Empirically, it matches or exceeds standard softmax attention across various sequence modeling benchmarks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.05230v1,,False
