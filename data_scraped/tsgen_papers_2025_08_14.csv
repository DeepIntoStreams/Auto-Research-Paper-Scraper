Vision-driven River Following of UAV via Safe Reinforcement Learning using Semantic Dynamics Model,13/08/2025,"Zihan Wang, Nina Mahmoudian","Vision-driven autonomous river following by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles is
critical for applications such as rescue, surveillance, and environmental
monitoring, particularly in dense riverine environments where GPS signals are
unreliable. We formalize river following as a coverage control problem in which
the reward function is submodular, yielding diminishing returns as more unique
river segments are visited, thereby framing the task as a Submodular Markov
Decision Process. First, we introduce Marginal Gain Advantage Estimation, which
refines the reward advantage function by using a sliding window baseline
computed from historical episodic returns, thus aligning the advantage
estimation with the agent's evolving recognition of action value in
non-Markovian settings. Second, we develop a Semantic Dynamics Model based on
patchified water semantic masks that provides more interpretable and
data-efficient short-term prediction of future observations compared to latent
vision dynamics models. Third, we present the Constrained Actor Dynamics
Estimator architecture, which integrates the actor, the cost estimator, and SDM
for cost advantage estimation to form a model-based SafeRL framework capable of
solving partially observable Constrained Submodular Markov Decision Processes.
Simulation results demonstrate that MGAE achieves faster convergence and
superior performance over traditional critic-based methods like Generalized
Advantage Estimation. SDM provides more accurate short-term state predictions
that enable the cost estimator to better predict potential violations. Overall,
CADE effectively integrates safety regulation into model-based RL, with the
Lagrangian approach achieving the soft balance of reward and safety during
training, while the safety layer enhances performance during inference by hard
action overlay.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09971v1,,False
Specialised or Generic? Tokenization Choices for Radiology Language Models,13/08/2025,"Hermione Warr, Wentian Xu, Harry Anthony, Yasin Ibrahim, Daniel McGowan, Konstantinos Kamnitsas","The vocabulary used by language models (LM) - defined by the tokenizer -
plays a key role in text generation quality. However, its impact remains
under-explored in radiology. In this work, we address this gap by
systematically comparing general, medical, and domain-specific tokenizers on
the task of radiology report summarisation across three imaging modalities. We
also investigate scenarios with and without LM pre-training on PubMed
abstracts. Our findings demonstrate that medical and domain-specific
vocabularies outperformed widely used natural language alternatives when models
are trained from scratch. Pre-training partially mitigates performance
differences between tokenizers, whilst the domain-specific tokenizers achieve
the most favourable results. Domain-specific tokenizers also reduce memory
requirements due to smaller vocabularies and shorter sequences. These results
demonstrate that adapting the vocabulary of LMs to the clinical domain provides
practical benefits, including improved performance and reduced computational
demands, making such models more accessible and effective for both research and
real-world healthcare settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09952v1,,False
Perceptual Reality Transformer: Neural Architectures for Simulating Neurological Perception Conditions,13/08/2025,Baihan Lin,"Neurological conditions affecting visual perception create profound
experiential divides between affected individuals and their caregivers,
families, and medical professionals. We present the Perceptual Reality
Transformer, a comprehensive framework employing six distinct neural
architectures to simulate eight neurological perception conditions with
scientifically-grounded visual transformations. Our system learns mappings from
natural images to condition-specific perceptual states, enabling others to
experience approximations of simultanagnosia, prosopagnosia, ADHD attention
deficits, visual agnosia, depression-related changes, anxiety tunnel vision,
and Alzheimer's memory effects. Through systematic evaluation across ImageNet
and CIFAR-10 datasets, we demonstrate that Vision Transformer architectures
achieve optimal performance, outperforming traditional CNN and generative
approaches. Our work establishes the first systematic benchmark for
neurological perception simulation, contributes novel condition-specific
perturbation functions grounded in clinical literature, and provides
quantitative metrics for evaluating simulation fidelity. The framework has
immediate applications in medical education, empathy training, and assistive
technology development, while advancing our fundamental understanding of how
neural networks can model atypical human perception.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09852v1,,False
Speed Always Wins: A Survey on Efficient Architectures for Large Language Models,13/08/2025,"Weigao Sun, Jiaxi Hu, Yucheng Zhou, Jusen Du, Disen Lan, Kexin Wang, Tong Zhu, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Zhang, Xiaoyu Mo, Daizong Liu, Yuxuan Liang, Wenliang Chen, Guoqi Li, Yu Cheng","Large Language Models (LLMs) have delivered impressive results in language
understanding, generation, reasoning, and pushes the ability boundary of
multimodal models. Transformer models, as the foundation of modern LLMs, offer
a strong baseline with excellent scaling properties. However, the traditional
transformer architecture requires substantial computations and poses
significant obstacles for large-scale training and practical deployment. In
this survey, we offer a systematic examination of innovative LLM architectures
that address the inherent limitations of transformers and boost the efficiency.
Starting from language modeling, this survey covers the background and
technical details of linear and sparse sequence modeling methods, efficient
full attention variants, sparse mixture-of-experts, hybrid model architectures
incorporating the above techniques, and emerging diffusion LLMs. Additionally,
we discuss applications of these techniques to other modalities and consider
their wider implications for developing scalable, resource-aware foundation
models. By grouping recent studies into the above category, this survey
presents a blueprint of modern efficient LLM architectures, and we hope this
could help motivate future research toward more efficient, versatile AI
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09834v1,,False
Provable In-Context Vector Arithmetic via Retrieving Task Concepts,13/08/2025,"Dake Bu, Wei Huang, Andi Han, Atsushi Nitanda, Qingfu Zhang, Hau-San Wong, Taiji Suzuki","In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09820v1,,False
Structured Kernel Regression VAE: A Computationally Efficient Surrogate for GP-VAEs in ICA,13/08/2025,"Yuan-Hao Wei, Fu-Hao Deng, Lin-Yong Cui, Yan-Jie Sun","The interpretability of generative models is considered a key factor in
demonstrating their effectiveness and controllability. The generated data are
believed to be determined by latent variables that are not directly observable.
Therefore, disentangling, decoupling, decomposing, causal inference, or
performing Independent Component Analysis (ICA) in the latent variable space
helps uncover the independent factors that influence the attributes or features
affecting the generated outputs, thereby enhancing the interpretability of
generative models. As a generative model, Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
combine with variational Bayesian inference algorithms. Using VAEs, the inverse
process of ICA can be equivalently framed as a variational inference process.
In some studies, Gaussian processes (GPs) have been introduced as priors for
each dimension of latent variables in VAEs, structuring and separating each
dimension from temporal or spatial perspectives, and encouraging different
dimensions to control various attributes of the generated data. However, GPs
impose a significant computational burden, resulting in substantial resource
consumption when handling large datasets. Essentially, GPs model different
temporal or spatial structures through various kernel functions. Structuring
the priors of latent variables via kernel functions-so that different kernel
functions model the correlations among sequence points within different latent
dimensions-is at the core of achieving disentanglement in VAEs. The proposed
Structured Kernel Regression VAE (SKR-VAE) leverages this core idea in a more
efficient way, avoiding the costly kernel matrix inversion required in GPs.
This research demonstrates that, while maintaining ICA performance, SKR-VAE
achieves greater computational efficiency and significantly reduced
computational burden compared to GP-VAE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09721v1,,False
TimeMKG: Knowledge-Infused Causal Reasoning for Multivariate Time Series Modeling,13/08/2025,"Yifei Sun, Junming Liu, Ding Wang, Yirong Chen, Xuefeng Yan","Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive
performance and generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09630v1,,False
Physics- and geometry-aware spatio-spectral graph neural operator for time-independent and time-dependent PDEs,13/08/2025,"Subhankar Sarkar, Souvik Chakraborty","Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09627v1,,False
EvoCurr: Self-evolving Curriculum with Behavior Code Generation for Complex Decision-making,13/08/2025,"Yang Cheng, Zilai Wang, Weiyu Ma, Wenhui Zhu, Yue Deng, Jian Zhao","Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09586v1,,False
"Edge General Intelligence Through World Models and Agentic AI: Fundamentals, Solutions, and Challenges",13/08/2025,"Changyuan Zhao, Guangyuan Liu, Ruichen Zhang, Yinqiu Liu, Jiacheng Wang, Jiawen Kang, Dusit Niyato, Zan Li, Xuemin, Shen, Zhu Han, Sumei Sun, Chau Yuen, Dong In Kim","Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.

AI Blob! LLM-Driven Recontextualization of Italian Television Archives,13/08/2025,Roberto Balestri,"This paper introduces AI Blob!, an experimental system designed to explore
the potential of semantic cataloging and Large Language Models (LLMs) for the
retrieval and recontextualization of archival television footage. Drawing
methodological inspiration from Italian television programs such as Blob (RAI
Tre, 1989-), AI Blob! integrates automatic speech recognition (ASR), semantic
embeddings, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to organize and
reinterpret archival content. The system processes a curated dataset of 1,547
Italian television videos by transcribing audio, segmenting it into
sentence-level units, and embedding these segments into a vector database for
semantic querying. Upon user input of a thematic prompt, the LLM generates a
range of linguistically and conceptually related queries, guiding the retrieval
and recombination of audiovisual fragments. These fragments are algorithmically
selected and structured into narrative sequences producing montages that
emulate editorial practices of ironic juxtaposition and thematic coherence. By
foregrounding dynamic, content-aware retrieval over static metadata schemas, AI
Blob! demonstrates how semantic technologies can facilitate new approaches to
archival engagement, enabling novel forms of automated narrative construction
and cultural analysis. The project contributes to ongoing debates in media
historiography and AI-driven archival research, offering both a conceptual
framework and a publicly available dataset to support further interdisciplinary
experimentation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09535v1,,False
Large-Small Model Collaborative Framework for Federated Continual Learning,13/08/2025,"Hao Yu, Xin Yang, Boyang Fan, Xuemei Cao, Hanlin Gu, Lixin Fan, Qiang Yang","Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in
FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually
adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel
components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for
preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation
performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients
utilize heterogeneous small models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09489v1,,False
"DeepFeatIoT: Unifying Deep Learned, Randomized, and LLM Features for Enhanced IoT Time Series Sensor Data Classification in Smart Industries",13/08/2025,"Muhammad Sakib Khan Inan, Kewen Liao","Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time

RelayFormer: A Unified Local-Global Attention Framework for Scalable Image and Video Manipulation Localization,13/08/2025,"Wen Huang, Jiarui Yang, Tao Dai, Jiawei Li, Shaoxiong Zhan, Bin Wang, Shu-Tao Xia","Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting

A Unified Contrastive-Generative Framework for Time Series Classification,13/08/2025,"Ziyu Liu, Azadeh Alavi, Minyi Li, Xiang Zhang","Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings

Integrating Feature Attention and Temporal Modeling for Collaborative Financial Risk Assessment,13/08/2025,"Yue Yao, Zhen Xu, Youzhu Liu, Kunyuan Ma, Yuxiu Lin, Mohan Jiang","This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
