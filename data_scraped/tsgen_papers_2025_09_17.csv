QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices,16/09/2025,"Donovan L. Buterakos, Sandesh S. Kalantre, Joshua Ziegler, Jacob M Taylor, Justyna P. Zwolak","Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in
calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches
rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training,
benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data.
Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data
availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an
open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic
synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent
Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to
produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling
experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models,
QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development,
benchmarking, and quantum device research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13298v1,,False
Accelerating Protein Molecular Dynamics Simulation with DeepJump,16/09/2025,"Allan dos Santos Costa, Manvitha Ponnapati, Dana Rubin, Tess Smidt, Joseph Jacobson","Unraveling the dynamical motions of biomolecules is essential for bridging
their structure and function, yet it remains a major computational challenge.
Molecular dynamics (MD) simulation provides a detailed depiction of
biomolecular motion, but its high-resolution temporal evolution comes at
significant computational cost, limiting its applicability to timescales of
biological relevance. Deep learning approaches have emerged as promising
solutions to overcome these computational limitations by learning to predict
long-timescale dynamics. However, generalizable kinetics models for proteins
remain largely unexplored, and the fundamental limits of achievable
acceleration while preserving dynamical accuracy are poorly understood. In this
work, we fill this gap with DeepJump, an Euclidean-Equivariant Flow
Matching-based model for predicting protein conformational dynamics across
multiple temporal scales. We train DeepJump on trajectories of the diverse
proteins of mdCATH, systematically studying our model's performance in
generalizing to long-term dynamics of fast-folding proteins and characterizing
the trade-off between computational acceleration and prediction accuracy. We
demonstrate the application of DeepJump to ab initio folding, showcasing
prediction of folding pathways and native states. Our results demonstrate that
DeepJump achieves significant $\approx$1000$\times$ computational acceleration
while effectively recovering long-timescale dynamics, providing a stepping
stone for enabling routine simulation of proteins.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13294v1,,False
Learning Discrete Bayesian Networks with Hierarchical Dirichlet Shrinkage,16/09/2025,"Alexander Dombowsky, David B. Dunson","Discrete Bayesian networks (DBNs) provide a broadly useful framework for
modeling dependence structures in multivariate categorical data. There is a
vast literature on methods for inferring conditional probabilities and
graphical structure in DBNs, but data sparsity and parametric assumptions are
major practical issues. In this article, we detail a comprehensive Bayesian
framework for learning DBNs. First, we propose a hierarchical prior for the
conditional probabilities that enables complicated interactions between parent
variables and stability in sparse regimes. We give a novel Markov chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) algorithm utilizing parallel Langevin proposals to generate exact
posterior samples, avoiding the pitfalls of variational approximations.
Moreover, we verify that the full conditional distribution of the concentration
parameters is log-concave under mild conditions, facilitating efficient
sampling. We then propose two methods for learning network structures,
including parent sets, Markov blankets, and DAGs, from categorical data. The
first cycles through individual edges each MCMC iteration, whereas the second
updates the entire structure as a single step. We evaluate the accuracy, power,
and MCMC performance of our methods on several simulation studies. Finally, we
apply our methodology to uncover prognostic network structure from primary
breast cancer samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13267v1,,False
Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in Diabetic Retinopathy,16/09/2025,"Nadim Barakat, William Lotter","Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13234v1,,False
Single-stream Policy Optimization,16/09/2025,"Zhongwen Xu, Zihan Ding","We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13232v1,,False
Curriculum Learning for Mesh-based simulations,16/09/2025,"Paul Garnier, Vincent Lannelongue, Elie Hachem","Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13138v1,,False
Discovering Mathematical Equations with Diffusion Language Model,16/09/2025,"Xiaoxu Han, Chengzhen Ning, Jinghui Zhong, Fubiao Yang, Yu Wang, Xin Mu","Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse
mathematical expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13136v1,,False
"An Uncertainty-Weighted Decision Transformer for Navigation in Dense, Complex Driving Scenarios",16/09/2025,"Zhihao Zhang, Chengyang Peng, Minghao Zhu, Ekim Yurtsever, Keith A. Redmill","Autonomous driving in dense, dynamic environments requires decision-making
systems that can exploit both spatial structure and long-horizon temporal
dependencies while remaining robust to uncertainty. This work presents a novel
framework that integrates multi-channel bird's-eye-view occupancy grids with
transformer-based sequence modeling for tactical driving in complex roundabout
scenarios. To address the imbalance between frequent low-risk states and rare
safety-critical decisions, we propose the Uncertainty-Weighted Decision
Transformer (UWDT). UWDT employs a frozen teacher transformer to estimate
per-token predictive entropy, which is then used as a weight in the student
model's loss function. This mechanism amplifies learning from uncertain,
high-impact states while maintaining stability across common low-risk
transitions. Experiments in a roundabout simulator, across varying traffic
densities, show that UWDT consistently outperforms other baselines in terms of
reward, collision rate, and behavioral stability. The results demonstrate that
uncertainty-aware, spatial-temporal transformers can deliver safer and more
efficient decision-making for autonomous driving in complex traffic
environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13132v1,,False
A Design Co-Pilot for Task-Tailored Manipulators,16/09/2025,"Jonathan Külz, Sehoon Ha, Matthias Althoff","Although robotic manipulators are used in an ever-growing range of
applications, robot manufacturers typically follow a ``one-fits-all''
philosophy, employing identical manipulators in various settings. This often
leads to suboptimal performance, as general-purpose designs fail to exploit
particularities of tasks. The development of custom, task-tailored robots is
hindered by long, cost-intensive development cycles and the high cost of
customized hardware. Recently, various computational design methods have been
devised to overcome the bottleneck of human engineering. In addition, a surge
of modular robots allows quick and economical adaptation to changing industrial
settings. This work proposes an approach to automatically designing and
optimizing robot morphologies tailored to a specific environment. To this end,
we learn the inverse kinematics for a wide range of different manipulators. A
fully differentiable framework realizes gradient-based fine-tuning of designed
robots and inverse kinematics solutions. Our generative approach accelerates
the generation of specialized designs from hours with optimization-based
methods to seconds, serving as a design co-pilot that enables instant
adaptation and effective human-AI collaboration. Numerical experiments show
that our approach finds robots that can navigate cluttered environments,
manipulators that perform well across a specified workspace, and can be adapted
to different hardware constraints. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
applicability of our method by setting up a modular robot designed in
simulation that successfully moves through an obstacle course.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13077v1,,False
A Visualized Framework for Event Cooperation with Generative Agents,16/09/2025,"Yuyang Tian, Shunqiang Mao, Wenchang Gao, Lanlan Qiu, Tianxing He","Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in

Toward PDDL Planning Copilot,16/09/2025,"Yarin Benyamin, Argaman Mordoch, Shahaf S. Shperberg, Roni Stern","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12987v1,,False
Modeling nonstationary spatial processes with normalizing flows,16/09/2025,"Pratik Nag, Andrew Zammit-Mangion, Ying Sun","Nonstationary spatial processes can often be represented as stationary
processes on a warped spatial domain. Selecting an appropriate spatial warping
function for a given application is often difficult and, as a result of this,
warping methods have largely been limited to two-dimensional spatial domains.
In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to modeling nonstationary,
anisotropic spatial processes using neural autoregressive flows (NAFs), a class
of invertible mappings capable of generating complex, high-dimensional
warpings. Through simulation studies we demonstrate that a NAF-based model has
greater representational capacity than other commonly used spatial process

CECT-Mamba: a Hierarchical Contrast-enhanced-aware Model for Pancreatic Tumor Subtyping from Multi-phase CECT,16/09/2025,"Zhifang Gong, Shuo Gao, Ben Zhao, Yingjing Xu, Yijun Yang, Shenghong Ju, Guangquan Zhou","Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors

Toward Ownership Understanding of Objects: Active Question Generation with Large Language Model and Probabilistic Generative Model,16/09/2025,"Saki Hashimoto, Shoichi Hasegawa, Tomochika Ishikawa, Akira Taniguchi, Yoshinobu Hagiwara, Lotfi El Hafi, Tadahiro Taniguchi","Robots operating in domestic and office environments must understand object
ownership to correctly execute instructions such as ``Bring me my cup.''
However, ownership cannot be reliably inferred from visual features alone. To
address this gap, we propose Active Ownership Learning (ActOwL), a framework
that enables robots to actively generate and ask ownership-related questions to
users. ActOwL employs a probabilistic generative model to select questions that
maximize information gain, thereby acquiring ownership knowledge efficiently to
improve learning efficiency. Additionally, by leveraging commonsense knowledge
from Large Language Models (LLM), objects are pre-classified as either shared
or owned, and only owned objects are targeted for questioning. Through
experiments in a simulated home environment and a real-world laboratory
setting, ActOwL achieved significantly higher ownership clustering accuracy
with fewer questions than baseline methods. These findings demonstrate the
effectiveness of combining active inference with LLM-guided commonsense
reasoning, advancing the capability of robots to acquire ownership knowledge

A Novel Recurrent Neural Network Framework for Prediction and Treatment of Oncogenic Mutation Progression,16/09/2025,"Rishab Parthasarathy, Achintya Bhowmik","Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12732v1,,False
Generalizable Holographic Reconstruction via Amplitude-Only Diffusion Priors,16/09/2025,"Jeongsol Kim, Chanseok Lee, Jong Chul Ye, Mooseok Jang","Phase retrieval in inline holography is a fundamental yet ill-posed inverse
problem due to the nonlinear coupling between amplitude and phase in coherent
imaging. We present a novel off-the-shelf solution that leverages a diffusion
model trained solely on object amplitude to recover both amplitude and phase
from diffraction intensities. Using a predictor-corrector sampling framework

complex field reconstruction without requiring ground-truth phase data for
training. We validate the proposed approach through extensive simulations and
experiments, demonstrating robust generalization across diverse object shapes,
imaging system configurations, and modalities, including lensless setups.
Notably, a diffusion prior trained on simple amplitude data (e.g., polystyrene
beads) successfully reconstructs complex biological tissue structures,

Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning,16/09/2025,"Jie Yin, Ke Sun, Han Wu","Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12727v1,,False

(AoI)-aware space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture that
leverages a high-altitude platform (HAP) as intelligent relay between the LEO

historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support

which is time-consuming and prone to errors, further straining
ophthalmologists' limited resources. This thesis investigates the potential of
Artificial Intelligence (AI) to automate medical report generation for retinal
