"Abduct, Act, Predict: Scaffolding Causal Inference for Automated Failure Attribution in Multi-Agent Systems",12/09/2025,"Alva West, Yixuan Weng, Minjun Zhu, Zhen Lin, Yue Zhang","Failure attribution in multi-agent systems -- pinpointing the exact step
where a decisive error occurs -- is a critical yet unsolved challenge. Current
methods treat this as a pattern recognition task over long conversation logs,
leading to critically low step-level accuracy (below 17\%), which renders them
impractical for debugging complex systems. Their core weakness is a fundamental
inability to perform robust counterfactual reasoning: to determine if
correcting a single action would have actually averted the task failure. To
bridge this counterfactual inference gap, we introduce Abduct-Act-Predict (A2P)
Scaffolding, a novel agent framework that transforms failure attribution from
pattern recognition into a structured causal inference task. A2P explicitly
guides a large language model through a formal three-step reasoning process
within a single inference pass: (1) Abduction, to infer the hidden root causes
behind an agent's actions; (2) Action, to define a minimal corrective
intervention; and (3) Prediction, to simulate the subsequent trajectory and
verify if the intervention resolves the failure. This structured approach
leverages the holistic context of the entire conversation while imposing a
rigorous causal logic on the model's analysis. Our extensive experiments on the
Who\&When benchmark demonstrate its efficacy. On the Algorithm-Generated
dataset, A2P achieves 47.46\% step-level accuracy, a 2.85$\times$ improvement
over the 16.67\% of the baseline. On the more complex Hand-Crafted dataset, it
achieves 29.31\% step accuracy, a 2.43$\times$ improvement over the baseline's
12.07\%. By reframing the problem through a causal lens, A2P Scaffolding
provides a robust, verifiable, and significantly more accurate solution for
automated failure attribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10401v1,,False
Towards Understanding Visual Grounding in Visual Language Models,12/09/2025,"Georgios Pantazopoulos, Eda B. Özyiğit","Visual grounding refers to the ability of a model to identify a region within
some visual input that matches a textual description. Consequently, a model
equipped with visual grounding capabilities can target a wide range of
applications in various domains, including referring expression comprehension,
answering questions pertinent to fine-grained details in images or videos,
caption visual context by explicitly referring to entities, as well as low and
high-level control in simulated and real environments. In this survey paper, we
review representative works across the key areas of research on modern
general-purpose vision language models (VLMs). We first outline the importance
of grounding in VLMs, then delineate the core components of the contemporary
paradigm for developing grounded models, and examine their practical
applications, including benchmarks and evaluation metrics for grounded
multimodal generation. We also discuss the multifaceted interrelations among
visual grounding, multimodal chain-of-thought, and reasoning in VLMs. Finally,
we analyse the challenges inherent to visual grounding and suggest promising
directions for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10345v1,,False
ARMA Block: A CNN-Based Autoregressive and Moving Average Module for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting,12/09/2025,"Myung Jin Kim, YeongHyeon Park, Il Dong Yun","This paper proposes a simple yet effective convolutional module for long-term
time series forecasting. The proposed block, inspired by the Auto-Regressive
Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model, consists of two convolutional
components: one for capturing the trend (autoregression) and the other for
refining local variations (moving average). Unlike conventional ARIMA, which
requires iterative multi-step forecasting, the block directly performs
multi-step forecasting, making it easily extendable to multivariate settings.
Experiments on nine widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method
ARMA achieves competitive accuracy, particularly on datasets exhibiting strong
trend variations, while maintaining architectural simplicity. Furthermore,
analysis shows that the block inherently encodes absolute positional
information, suggesting its potential as a lightweight replacement for
positional embeddings in sequential models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10324v1,,False
GraphCSVAE: Graph Categorical Structured Variational Autoencoder for Spatiotemporal Auditing of Physical Vulnerability Towards Sustainable Post-Disaster Risk Reduction,12/09/2025,"Joshua Dimasaka, Christian Geiß, Robert Muir-Wood, Emily So","In the aftermath of disasters, many institutions worldwide face challenges in
continually monitoring changes in disaster risk, limiting the ability of key
decision-makers to assess progress towards the UN Sendai Framework for Disaster
Risk Reduction 2015-2030. While numerous efforts have substantially advanced
the large-scale modeling of hazard and exposure through Earth observation and
data-driven methods, progress remains limited in modeling another equally
important yet challenging element of the risk equation: physical vulnerability.
To address this gap, we introduce Graph Categorical Structured Variational
Autoencoder (GraphCSVAE), a novel probabilistic data-driven framework for
modeling physical vulnerability by integrating deep learning, graph
representation, and categorical probabilistic inference, using time-series
satellite-derived datasets and prior expert belief systems. We introduce a
weakly supervised first-order transition matrix that reflects the changes in
the spatiotemporal distribution of physical vulnerability in two
disaster-stricken and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas: (1) the
cyclone-impacted coastal Khurushkul community in Bangladesh and (2) the
mudslide-affected city of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Our work reveals
post-disaster regional dynamics in physical vulnerability, offering valuable
insights into localized spatiotemporal auditing and sustainable strategies for
post-disaster risk reduction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10308v1,,False
Generalizing Beyond Suboptimality: Offline Reinforcement Learning Learns Effective Scheduling through Random Data,12/09/2025,"Jesse van Remmerden, Zaharah Bukhsh, Yingqian Zhang","The Job-Shop Scheduling Problem (JSP) and Flexible Job-Shop Scheduling
Problem (FJSP), are canonical combinatorial optimization problems with
wide-ranging applications in industrial operations. In recent years, many
online reinforcement learning (RL) approaches have been proposed to learn
constructive heuristics for JSP and FJSP. Although effective, these online RL
methods require millions of interactions with simulated environments that may
not capture real-world complexities, and their random policy initialization
leads to poor sample efficiency. To address these limitations, we introduce
Conservative Discrete Quantile Actor-Critic (CDQAC), a novel offline RL
algorithm that learns effective scheduling policies directly from historical
data, eliminating the need for costly online interactions, while maintaining
the ability to improve upon suboptimal training data. CDQAC couples a
quantile-based critic with a delayed policy update, estimating the return
distribution of each machine-operation pair rather than selecting pairs
outright. Our extensive experiments demonstrate CDQAC's remarkable ability to
learn from diverse data sources. CDQAC consistently outperforms the original
data-generating heuristics and surpasses state-of-the-art offline and online RL
baselines. In addition, CDQAC is highly sample efficient, requiring only 10-20
training instances to learn high-quality policies. Surprisingly, we find that
CDQAC performs better when trained on data generated by a random heuristic than
when trained on higher-quality data from genetic algorithms and priority
dispatching rules.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10303v1,,False
A Certifiable Machine Learning-Based Pipeline to Predict Fatigue Life of Aircraft Structures,12/09/2025,"Ángel Ladrón, Miguel Sánchez-Domínguez, Javier Rozalén, Fernando R. Sánchez, Javier de Vicente, Lucas Lacasa, Eusebio Valero, Gonzalo Rubio","Fatigue life prediction is essential in both the design and operational
phases of any aircraft, and in this sense safety in the aerospace industry
requires early detection of fatigue cracks to prevent in-flight failures.
Robust and precise fatigue life predictors are thus essential to ensure safety.
Traditional engineering methods, while reliable, are time consuming and involve
complex workflows, including steps such as conducting several Finite Element
Method (FEM) simulations, deriving the expected loading spectrum, and applying
cycle counting techniques like peak-valley or rainflow counting. These steps
often require collaboration between multiple teams and tools, added to the
computational time and effort required to achieve fatigue life predictions.
Machine learning (ML) offers a promising complement to traditional fatigue life
estimation methods, enabling faster iterations and generalization, providing
quick estimates that guide decisions alongside conventional simulations.
  In this paper, we present a ML-based pipeline that aims to estimate the
fatigue life of different aircraft wing locations given the flight parameters
of the different missions that the aircraft will be operating throughout its
operational life. We validate the pipeline in a realistic use case of fatigue
life estimation, yielding accurate predictions alongside a thorough statistical
validation and uncertainty quantification. Our pipeline constitutes a
complement to traditional methodologies by reducing the amount of costly
simulations and, thereby, lowering the required computational and human
resources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10227v1,,False
SI-FACT: Mitigating Knowledge Conflict via Self-Improving Faithfulness-Aware Contrastive Tuning,12/09/2025,Shengqiang Fu,"Large Language Models often generate unfaithful responses in knowledge
intensive tasks due to knowledge conflict,that is,a preference for relying on
internal parametric knowledge rather than the provided context.To address this
issue,we propose a novel self improving framework,Self Improving Faithfulness
Aware Contrastive Tuning.The framework uses a self instruct mechanism that
allows the base LLM to automatically generate high quality,structured
contrastive learning data,including anchor samples,semantically equivalent
positive samples,and negative samples simulating unfaithful scenarios.This
approach significantly reduces the cost of manual
annotation.Subsequently,contrastive learning is applied to train the
model,enabling it to pull faithful responses closer and push unfaithful
responses farther apart in the representation space.Experiments on knowledge
conflict evaluation benchmarks ECARE KRE and COSE KRE show that the SI FACT
model based on Llama3 8B Instruct improves the Contextual Recall Rate by 6.2%
over the best baseline method,while significantly reducing dependence on
internal memory.The results indicate that SI FACT provides strong effectiveness
and high data efficiency in enhancing the contextual faithfulness of
LLMs,offering a practical pathway toward building more proactive and
trustworthy language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10208v1,,False
P3D: Scalable Neural Surrogates for High-Resolution 3D Physics Simulations with Global Context,12/09/2025,"Benjamin Holzschuh, Georg Kohl, Florian Redinger, Nils Thuerey","We present a scalable framework for learning deterministic and probabilistic
neural surrogates for high-resolution 3D physics simulations. We introduce a
hybrid CNN-Transformer backbone architecture targeted for 3D physics
simulations, which significantly outperforms existing architectures in terms of
speed and accuracy. Our proposed network can be pretrained on small patches of
the simulation domain, which can be fused to obtain a global solution,
optionally guided via a fast and scalable sequence-to-sequence model to include
long-range dependencies. This setup allows for training large-scale models with
reduced memory and compute requirements for high-resolution datasets. We
evaluate our backbone architecture against a large set of baseline methods with
the objective to simultaneously learn the dynamics of 14 different types of
PDEs in 3D. We demonstrate how to scale our model to high-resolution isotropic
turbulence with spatial resolutions of up to $512^3$. Finally, we demonstrate
the versatility of our network by training it as a diffusion model to produce
probabilistic samples of highly turbulent 3D channel flows across varying
Reynolds numbers, accurately capturing the underlying flow statistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10186v1,,False
Repulsive Monte Carlo on the sphere for the sliced Wasserstein distance,12/09/2025,"Vladimir Petrovic, Rémi Bardenet, Agnès Desolneux","In this paper, we consider the problem of computing the integral of a
function on the unit sphere, in any dimension, using Monte Carlo methods.
Although the methods we present are general, our guiding thread is the sliced
Wasserstein distance between two measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, which is precisely
an integral on the $d$-dimensional sphere. The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW)
has gained momentum in machine learning either as a proxy to the less
computationally tractable Wasserstein distance, or as a distance in its own
right, due in particular to its built-in alleviation of the curse of
dimensionality. There has been recent numerical benchmarks of quadratures for
the sliced Wasserstein, and our viewpoint differs in that we concentrate on
quadratures where the nodes are repulsive, i.e. negatively dependent. Indeed,
negative dependence can bring variance reduction when the quadrature is adapted
to the integration task. Our first contribution is to extract and motivate
quadratures from the recent literature on determinantal point processes (DPPs)
and repelled point processes, as well as repulsive quadratures from the
literature specific to the sliced Wasserstein distance. We then numerically
benchmark these quadratures. Moreover, we analyze the variance of the UnifOrtho
estimator, an orthogonal Monte Carlo estimator. Our analysis sheds light on
UnifOrtho's success for the estimation of the sliced Wasserstein in large
dimensions, as well as counterexamples from the literature. Our final
recommendation for the computation of the sliced Wasserstein distance is to use
randomized quasi-Monte Carlo in low dimensions and \emph{UnifOrtho} in large
dimensions. DPP-based quadratures only shine when quasi-Monte Carlo also does,
while repelled quadratures show moderate variance reduction in general, but
more theoretical effort is needed to make them robust.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10166v1,,False
Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Privacy-Preserving and Energy-Aware Resource Management in 6G Edge Networks,12/09/2025,"Francisco Javier Esono Nkulu Andong, Qi Min","As sixth-generation (6G) networks move toward ultra-dense, intelligent edge
environments, efficient resource management under stringent privacy, mobility,
and energy constraints becomes critical. This paper introduces a novel
Federated Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (Fed-MARL) framework that
incorporates cross-layer orchestration of both the MAC layer and application
layer for energy-efficient, privacy-preserving, and real-time resource
management across heterogeneous edge devices. Each agent uses a Deep Recurrent
Q-Network (DRQN) to learn decentralized policies for task offloading, spectrum
access, and CPU energy adaptation based on local observations (e.g., queue
length, energy, CPU usage, and mobility). To protect privacy, we introduce a
secure aggregation protocol based on elliptic curve Diffie Hellman key
exchange, which ensures accurate model updates without exposing raw data to
semi-honest adversaries. We formulate the resource management problem as a
partially observable multi-agent Markov decision process (POMMDP) with a
multi-objective reward function that jointly optimizes latency, energy
efficiency, spectral efficiency, fairness, and reliability under 6G-specific
service requirements such as URLLC, eMBB, and mMTC. Simulation results
demonstrate that Fed-MARL outperforms centralized MARL and heuristic baselines
in task success rate, latency, energy efficiency, and fairness, while ensuring
robust privacy protection and scalability in dynamic, resource-constrained 6G
edge networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10163v1,,False
Online Robust Planning under Model Uncertainty: A Sample-Based Approach,12/09/2025,"Tamir Shazman, Idan Lev-Yehudi, Ron Benchetit, Vadim Indelman","Online planning in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) enables agents to make
sequential decisions by simulating future trajectories from the current state,
making it well-suited for large-scale or dynamic environments. Sample-based
methods such as Sparse Sampling and Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) are widely
adopted for their ability to approximate optimal actions using a generative
model. However, in practical settings, the generative model is often learned
from limited data, introducing approximation errors that can degrade
performance or lead to unsafe behaviors. To address these challenges, Robust
MDPs (RMDPs) offer a principled framework for planning under model uncertainty,
yet existing approaches are typically computationally intensive and not suited
for real-time use. In this work, we introduce Robust Sparse Sampling (RSS), the
first online planning algorithm for RMDPs with finite-sample theoretical
performance guarantees. Unlike Sparse Sampling, which estimates the nominal
value function, RSS computes a robust value function by leveraging the
efficiency and theoretical properties of Sample Average Approximation (SAA),
enabling tractable robust policy computation in online settings. RSS is
applicable to infinite or continuous state spaces, and its sample and
computational complexities are independent of the state space size. We provide
theoretical performance guarantees and empirically show that RSS outperforms
standard Sparse Sampling in environments with uncertain dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10162v1,,False
Population-Aligned Persona Generation for LLM-based Social Simulation,12/09/2025,"Zhengyu Hu, Zheyuan Xiao, Max Xiong, Yuxuan Lei, Tianfu Wang, Jianxun Lian, Kaize Ding, Ziang Xiao, Nicholas Jing Yuan, Xing Xie","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled human-like
social simulations at unprecedented scale and fidelity, offering new
opportunities for computational social science. A key challenge, however, is
the construction of persona sets that authentically represent the diversity and
distribution of real-world populations. Most existing LLM-based social
simulation studies focus primarily on designing agentic frameworks and
simulation environments, often overlooking the complexities of persona
generation and the potential biases introduced by unrepresentative persona
sets. In this paper, we propose a systematic framework for synthesizing
high-quality, population-aligned persona sets for LLM-driven social simulation.
Our approach begins by leveraging LLMs to generate narrative personas from
long-term social media data, followed by rigorous quality assessment to filter
out low-fidelity profiles. We then apply importance sampling to achieve global
alignment with reference psychometric distributions, such as the Big Five
personality traits. To address the needs of specific simulation contexts, we
further introduce a task-specific module that adapts the globally aligned
persona set to targeted subpopulations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method significantly reduces population-level bias and enables accurate,
flexible social simulation for a wide range of research and policy
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10127v1,,False
"TwinTac: A Wide-Range, Highly Sensitive Tactile Sensor with Real-to-Sim Digital Twin Sensor Model",12/09/2025,"Xiyan Huang, Zhe Xu, Chenxi Xiao","Robot skill acquisition processes driven by reinforcement learning often rely
on simulations to efficiently generate large-scale interaction data. However,
the absence of simulation models for tactile sensors has hindered the use of
tactile sensing in such skill learning processes, limiting the development of
effective policies driven by tactile perception. To bridge this gap, we present
TwinTac, a system that combines the design of a physical tactile sensor with
its digital twin model. Our hardware sensor is designed for high sensitivity
and a wide measurement range, enabling high quality sensing data essential for
object interaction tasks. Building upon the hardware sensor, we develop the
digital twin model using a real-to-sim approach. This involves collecting
synchronized cross-domain data, including finite element method results and the
physical sensor's outputs, and then training neural networks to map simulated
data to real sensor responses. Through experimental evaluation, we
characterized the sensitivity of the physical sensor and demonstrated the
consistency of the digital twin in replicating the physical sensor's output.
Furthermore, by conducting an object classification task, we showed that
simulation data generated by our digital twin sensor can effectively augment
real-world data, leading to improved accuracy. These results highlight
TwinTac's potential to bridge the gap in cross-domain learning tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10063v1,,False
Sparse Coding Representation of 2-way Data,12/09/2025,"Boya Ma, Abram Magner, Maxwell McNeil, Petko Bogdanov","Sparse dictionary coding represents signals as linear combinations of a few
dictionary atoms. It has been applied to images, time series, graph signals and
multi-way spatio-temporal data by jointly employing temporal and spatial
dictionaries. Data-agnostic analytical dictionaries, such as the discrete
Fourier transform, wavelets and graph Fourier, have seen wide adoption due to
efficient implementations and good practical performance. On the other hand,
dictionaries learned from data offer sparser and more accurate solutions but
require learning of both the dictionaries and the coding coefficients. This
becomes especially challenging for multi-dictionary scenarios since encoding
coefficients correspond to all atom combinations from the dictionaries. To
address this challenge, we propose a low-rank coding model for 2-dictionary
scenarios and study its data complexity. Namely, we establish a bound on the
number of samples needed to learn dictionaries that generalize to unseen
samples from the same distribution. We propose a convex relaxation solution,
called AODL, whose exact solution we show also solves the original problem. We
then solve this relaxation via alternating optimization between the sparse
coding matrices and the learned dictionaries, which we prove to be convergent.
We demonstrate its quality for data reconstruction and missing value imputation
in both synthetic and real-world datasets. For a fixed reconstruction quality,
AODL learns up to 90\% sparser solutions compared to non-low-rank and
analytical (fixed) dictionary baselines. In addition, the learned dictionaries
reveal interpretable insights into patterns present within the samples used for
training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.10033v1,,False
DyKen-Hyena: Dynamic Kernel Generation via Cross-Modal Attention for Multimodal Intent Recognition,12/09/2025,"Yifei Wang, Wenbin Wang, Yong Luo","Though Multimodal Intent Recognition (MIR) proves effective by utilizing rich
information from multiple sources (e.g., language, video, and audio), the
potential for intent-irrelevant and conflicting information across modalities
may hinder performance from being further improved. Most current models attempt
to fuse modalities by applying mechanisms like multi-head attention to unimodal
feature sequences and then adding the result back to the original
representation. This process risks corrupting the primary linguistic features
with noisy or irrelevant non-verbal signals, as it often fails to capture the
fine-grained, token-level influence where non-verbal cues should modulate, not
just augment, textual meaning. To address this, we introduce DyKen-Hyena, which
reframes the problem from feature fusion to processing modulation. Our model
translates audio-visual cues into dynamic, per-token convolutional kernels that
directly modulate textual feature extraction. This fine-grained approach
achieves state-of-the-art results on the MIntRec and MIntRec2.0 benchmarks.
Notably, it yields a +10.46% F1-score improvement in out-of-scope detection,
validating that our method creates a fundamentally more robust intent
representation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09940v1,,False
Multi-Play Combinatorial Semi-Bandit Problem,12/09/2025,"Shintaro Nakamura, Yuko Kuroki, Wei Chen","In the combinatorial semi-bandit (CSB) problem, a player selects an action
from a combinatorial action set and observes feedback from the base arms
included in the action. While CSB is widely applicable to combinatorial
optimization problems, its restriction to binary decision spaces excludes
important cases involving non-negative integer flows or allocations, such as
the optimal transport and knapsack problems.To overcome this limitation, we
propose the multi-play combinatorial semi-bandit (MP-CSB), where a player can
select a non-negative integer action and observe multiple feedbacks from a
single arm in each round. We propose two algorithms for the MP-CSB. One is a
Thompson-sampling-based algorithm that is computationally feasible even when
the action space is exponentially large with respect to the number of arms, and
attains $O(\log T)$ distribution-dependent regret in the stochastic regime,
where $T$ is the time horizon. The other is a best-of-both-worlds algorithm,
which achieves $O(\log T)$ variance-dependent regret in the stochastic regime
and the worst-case $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left( \sqrt{T} \right)$ regret in the
adversarial regime. Moreover, its regret in adversarial one is data-dependent,
adapting to the cumulative loss of the optimal action, the total quadratic
variation, and the path-length of the loss sequence. Finally, we numerically
show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods in the CSB
literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.09933v1,,False
