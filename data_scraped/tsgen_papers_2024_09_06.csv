View-Invariant Policy Learning via Zero-Shot Novel View Synthesis,05/09/2024,"Stephen Tian, Blake Wulfe, Kyle Sargent, Katherine Liu, Sergey Zakharov, Vitor Guizilini, Jiajun Wu","Large-scale visuomotor policy learning is a promising approach toward
developing generalizable manipulation systems. Yet, policies that can be
deployed on diverse embodiments, environments, and observational modalities
remain elusive. In this work, we investigate how knowledge from large-scale
visual data of the world may be used to address one axis of variation for
generalizable manipulation: observational viewpoint. Specifically, we study
single-image novel view synthesis models, which learn 3D-aware scene-level
priors by rendering images of the same scene from alternate camera viewpoints
given a single input image. For practical application to diverse robotic data,
these models must operate zero-shot, performing view synthesis on unseen tasks
and environments. We empirically analyze view synthesis models within a simple
data-augmentation scheme that we call View Synthesis Augmentation (VISTA) to
understand their capabilities for learning viewpoint-invariant policies from
single-viewpoint demonstration data. Upon evaluating the robustness of policies
trained with our method to out-of-distribution camera viewpoints, we find that
they outperform baselines in both simulated and real-world manipulation tasks.

A method to benchmark high-dimensional process drift detection,05/09/2024,"Edgar Wolf, Tobias Windisch","Process curves are multi-variate finite time series data coming from
manufacturing processes. This paper studies machine learning methods for drifts
of process curves. A theoretic framework to synthetically generate process
curves in a controlled way is introduced in order to benchmark machine learning
algorithms for process drift detection. A evaluation score, called the temporal
area under the curve, is introduced, which allows to quantify how well machine
learning models unveil curves belonging to drift segments. Finally, a benchmark
study comparing popular machine learning approaches on synthetic data generated
with the introduced framework shown.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03669v1,,False
A DNN Biophysics Model with Topological and Electrostatic Features,05/09/2024,"Elyssa Sliheet, Md Abu Talha, Weihua Geng","In this project, we provide a deep-learning neural network (DNN) based
biophysics model to predict protein properties. The model uses multi-scale and
uniform topological and electrostatic features generated with protein
structural information and force field, which governs the molecular mechanics.
The topological features are generated using the element specified persistent
homology (ESPH) while the electrostatic features are fast computed using a
Cartesian treecode. These features are uniform in number for proteins with
various sizes thus the broadly available protein structure database can be used
in training the network. These features are also multi-scale thus the
resolution and computational cost can be balanced by the users. The machine
learning simulation on over 4000 protein structures shows the efficiency and
fidelity of these features in representing the protein structure and force
field for the predication of their biophysical properties such as electrostatic
solvation energy. Tests on topological or electrostatic features alone and the
combination of both showed the optimal performance when both features are used.
This model shows its potential as a general tool in assisting biophysical
properties and function prediction for the broad biomolecules using data from
both theoretical computing and experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03658v1,,False
VFLGAN-TS: Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Networks for Publication of Vertically Partitioned Time-Series Data,05/09/2024,"Xun Yuan, Zilong Zhao, Prosanta Gope, Biplab Sikdar","In the current artificial intelligence (AI) era, the scale and quality of the
dataset play a crucial role in training a high-quality AI model. However, often
original data cannot be shared due to privacy concerns and regulations. A
potential solution is to release a synthetic dataset with a similar
distribution to the private dataset. Nevertheless, in some scenarios, the
attributes required to train an AI model are distributed among different
parties, and the parties cannot share the local data for synthetic data
construction due to privacy regulations. In PETS 2024, we recently introduced
the first Vertical Federated Learning-based Generative Adversarial Network
(VFLGAN) for publishing vertically partitioned static data. However, VFLGAN
cannot effectively handle time-series data, presenting both temporal and
attribute dimensions. In this article, we proposed VFLGAN-TS, which combines
the ideas of attribute discriminator and vertical federated learning to
generate synthetic time-series data in the vertically partitioned scenario. The
performance of VFLGAN-TS is close to that of its counterpart, which is trained
in a centralized manner and represents the upper limit for VFLGAN-TS. To
further protect privacy, we apply a Gaussian mechanism to make VFLGAN-TS
satisfy an $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy. Besides, we develop an
enhanced privacy auditing scheme to evaluate the potential privacy breach
through the framework of VFLGAN-TS and synthetic datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03612v1,,False
Costs Estimation in Unit Commitment Problems using Simulation-Based Inference,05/09/2024,"Matthias Pirlet, Adrien Bolland, Gilles Louppe, Damien Ernst","The Unit Commitment (UC) problem is a key optimization task in power systems
to forecast the generation schedules of power units over a finite time period
by minimizing costs while meeting demand and technical constraints. However,
many parameters required by the UC problem are unknown, such as the costs. In
this work, we estimate these unknown costs using simulation-based inference on
an illustrative UC problem, which provides an approximated posterior
distribution of the parameters given observed generation schedules and demands.
Our results highlight that the learned posterior distribution effectively
captures the underlying distribution of the data, providing a range of possible
values for the unknown parameters given a past observation. This posterior
allows for the estimation of past costs using observed past generation
schedules, enabling operators to better forecast future costs and make more
robust generation scheduling forecasts. We present avenues for future research
to address overconfidence in posterior estimation, enhance the scalability of
the methodology and apply it to more complex UC problems modeling the network
constraints and renewable energy sources.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03588v1,,False
Reinforcement Learning Approach to Optimizing Profilometric Sensor Trajectories for Surface Inspection,05/09/2024,"Sara Roos-Hoefgeest, Mario Roos-Hoefgeest, Ignacio Alvarez, Rafael C. Gonz√°lez","High-precision surface defect detection in manufacturing is essential for
ensuring quality control. Laser triangulation profilometric sensors are key to
this process, providing detailed and accurate surface measurements over a line.
To achieve a complete and precise surface scan, accurate relative motion
between the sensor and the workpiece is required. It is crucial to control the
sensor pose to maintain optimal distance and relative orientation to the
surface. It is also important to ensure uniform profile distribution throughout
the scanning process. This paper presents a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL)
based approach to optimize robot inspection trajectories for profilometric
sensors. Building upon the Boustrophedon scanning method, our technique
dynamically adjusts the sensor position and tilt to maintain optimal
orientation and distance from the surface, while also ensuring a consistent
profile distance for uniform and high-quality scanning. Utilizing a simulated
environment based on the CAD model of the part, we replicate real-world
scanning conditions, including sensor noise and surface irregularities. This
simulation-based approach enables offline trajectory planning based on CAD
models. Key contributions include the modeling of the state space, action
space, and reward function, specifically designed for inspection applications
using profilometric sensors. We use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
algorithm to efficiently train the RL agent, demonstrating its capability to
optimize inspection trajectories with profilometric sensors. To validate our
approach, we conducted several experiments where a model trained on a specific
training piece was tested on various parts in simulation. Also, we conducted a
real-world experiment by executing the optimized trajectory, generated offline
from a CAD model, to inspect a part using a UR3e robotic arm model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03429v1,,False
An Effective Deployment of Diffusion LM for Data Augmentation in Low-Resource Sentiment Classification,05/09/2024,"Zhuowei Chen, Lianxi Wang, Yuben Wu, Xinfeng Liao, Yujia Tian, Junyang Zhong","Sentiment classification (SC) often suffers from low-resource challenges such
as domain-specific contexts, imbalanced label distributions, and few-shot
scenarios. The potential of the diffusion language model (LM) for textual data
augmentation (DA) remains unexplored, moreover, textual DA methods struggle to
balance the diversity and consistency of new samples. Most DA methods either
perform logical modifications or rephrase less important tokens in the original
sequence with the language model. In the context of SC, strong emotional tokens
could act critically on the sentiment of the whole sequence. Therefore,
contrary to rephrasing less important context, we propose DiffusionCLS to
leverage a diffusion LM to capture in-domain knowledge and generate pseudo
samples by reconstructing strong label-related tokens. This approach ensures a
balance between consistency and diversity, avoiding the introduction of noise
and augmenting crucial features of datasets. DiffusionCLS also comprises a
Noise-Resistant Training objective to help the model generalize. Experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in various low-resource scenarios
including domain-specific and domain-general problems. Ablation studies confirm
the effectiveness of our framework's modules, and visualization studies
highlight optimal deployment conditions, reinforcing our conclusions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03203v1,,False
Bypassing DARCY Defense: Indistinguishable Universal Adversarial Triggers,05/09/2024,"Zuquan Peng, Yuanyuan He, Jianbing Ni, Ben Niu","Neural networks (NN) classification models for Natural Language Processing
(NLP) are vulnerable to the Universal Adversarial Triggers (UAT) attack that
triggers a model to produce a specific prediction for any input. DARCY borrows
the ""honeypot"" concept to bait multiple trapdoors, effectively detecting the
adversarial examples generated by UAT. Unfortunately, we find a new UAT
generation method, called IndisUAT, which produces triggers (i.e., tokens) and
uses them to craft adversarial examples whose feature distribution is
indistinguishable from that of the benign examples in a randomly-chosen
category at the detection layer of DARCY. The produced adversarial examples
incur the maximal loss of predicting results in the DARCY-protected models.
Meanwhile, the produced triggers are effective in black-box models for text
generation, text inference, and reading comprehension. Finally, the evaluation
results under NN models for NLP tasks indicate that the IndisUAT method can
effectively circumvent DARCY and penetrate other defenses. For example,
IndisUAT can reduce the true positive rate of DARCY's detection by at least
40.8% and 90.6%, and drop the accuracy by at least 33.3% and 51.6% in the RNN
and CNN models, respectively. IndisUAT reduces the accuracy of the BERT's
adversarial defense model by at least 34.0%, and makes the GPT-2 language model
spew racist outputs even when conditioned on non-racial context.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03183v1,,False
