"Towards Fast, Specialized Machine Learning Force Fields: Distilling Foundation Models via Energy Hessians",15/01/2025,"Ishan Amin, Sanjeev Raja, Aditi Krishnapriyan","The foundation model (FM) paradigm is transforming Machine Learning Force
Fields (MLFFs), leveraging general-purpose representations and scalable
training to perform a variety of computational chemistry tasks. Although MLFF
FMs have begun to close the accuracy gap relative to first-principles methods,
there is still a strong need for faster inference speed. Additionally, while
research is increasingly focused on general-purpose models which transfer
across chemical space, practitioners typically only study a small subset of
systems at a given time. This underscores the need for fast, specialized MLFFs
relevant to specific downstream applications, which preserve test-time physical
soundness while maintaining train-time scalability. In this work, we introduce
a method for transferring general-purpose representations from MLFF foundation
models to smaller, faster MLFFs specialized to specific regions of chemical
space. We formulate our approach as a knowledge distillation procedure, where
the smaller ""student"" MLFF is trained to match the Hessians of the energy
predictions of the ""teacher"" foundation model. Our specialized MLFFs can be up
to 20 $\times$ faster than the original foundation model, while retaining, and
in some cases exceeding, its performance and that of undistilled models. We
also show that distilling from a teacher model with a direct force
parameterization into a student model trained with conservative forces (i.e.,
computed as derivatives of the potential energy) successfully leverages the
representations from the large-scale teacher for improved accuracy, while
maintaining energy conservation during test-time molecular dynamics
simulations. More broadly, our work suggests a new paradigm for MLFF
development, in which foundation models are released along with smaller,
specialized simulation ""engines"" for common chemical subsets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09009v1,,False
Personality Modeling for Persuasion of Misinformation using AI Agent,15/01/2025,"Qianmin Lou, Wentao Xu","The proliferation of misinformation on social media platforms has highlighted
the need to understand how individual personality traits influence
susceptibility to and propagation of misinformation. This study employs an
innovative agent-based modeling approach to investigate the relationship
between personality traits and misinformation dynamics. Using six AI agents
embodying different dimensions of the Big Five personality traits
(Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism), we simulated interactions
across six diverse misinformation topics. The experiment, implemented through
the AgentScope framework using the GLM-4-Flash model, generated 90 unique
interactions, revealing complex patterns in how personality combinations affect
persuasion and resistance to misinformation. Our findings demonstrate that
analytical and critical personality traits enhance effectiveness in
evidence-based discussions, while non-aggressive persuasion strategies show
unexpected success in misinformation correction. Notably, agents with critical
traits achieved a 59.4% success rate in HIV-related misinformation discussions,
while those employing non-aggressive approaches maintained consistent
persuasion rates above 40% across different personality combinations. The study
also revealed a non-transitive pattern in persuasion effectiveness, challenging
conventional assumptions about personality-based influence. These results
provide crucial insights for developing personality-aware interventions in
digital environments and suggest that effective misinformation countermeasures
should prioritize emotional connection and trust-building over confrontational
approaches. The findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of
personality-misinformation dynamics and practical strategies for combating
misinformation in social media contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08985v1,,False
Computing Approximated Fixpoints via Dampened Mann Iteration,15/01/2025,"Paolo Baldan, Sebastian Gurke, Barbara König, Tommaso Padoan, Florian Wittbold","Fixpoints are ubiquitous in computer science and when dealing with
quantitative semantics and verification one is commonly led to consider least
fixpoints of (higher-dimensional) functions over the nonnegative reals. We show
how to approximate the least fixpoint of such functions, focusing on the case
in which they are not known precisely, but represented by a sequence of
approximating functions that converge to them. We concentrate on monotone and
non-expansive functions, for which uniqueness of fixpoints is not guaranteed
and standard fixpoint iteration schemes might get stuck at a fixpoint that is
not the least. Our main contribution is the identification of an iteration
scheme, a variation of Mann iteration with a dampening factor, which, under
suitable conditions, is shown to guarantee convergence to the least fixpoint of
the function of interest. We then argue that these results are relevant in the
context of model-based reinforcement learning for Markov decision processes
(MDPs), showing that the proposed iteration scheme instantiates to MDPs and
allows us to derive convergence to the optimal expected return. More generally,
we show that our results can be used to iterate to the least fixpoint almost
surely for systems where the function of interest can be approximated with
given probabilistic error bounds, as it happens for probabilistic systems, such
as simple stochastic games, that can be explored via sampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08950v1,,False
RouteNet-Gauss: Hardware-Enhanced Network Modeling with Machine Learning,15/01/2025,"Carlos Güemes-Palau, Miquel Ferriol-Galmés, Jordi Paillisse-Vilanova, Albert López-Brescó, Pere Barlet-Ros, Albert Cabellos-Aparicio","Network simulation is pivotal in network modeling, assisting with tasks
ranging from capacity planning to performance estimation. Traditional
approaches such as Discrete Event Simulation (DES) face limitations in terms of
computational cost and accuracy. This paper introduces RouteNet-Gauss, a novel
integration of a testbed network with a Machine Learning (ML) model to address
these challenges. By using the testbed as a hardware accelerator,
RouteNet-Gauss generates training datasets rapidly and simulates network
scenarios with high fidelity to real-world conditions. Experimental results
show that RouteNet-Gauss significantly reduces prediction errors by up to 95%
and achieves a 488x speedup in inference time compared to state-of-the-art
DES-based methods. RouteNet-Gauss's modular architecture is dynamically
constructed based on the specific characteristics of the network scenario, such
as topology and routing. This enables it to understand and generalize to
different network configurations beyond those seen during training, including
networks up to 10x larger. Additionally, it supports Temporal Aggregated
Performance Estimation (TAPE), providing configurable temporal granularity and
maintaining high accuracy in flow performance metrics. This approach shows
promise in improving both simulation efficiency and accuracy, offering a
valuable tool for network operators.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08848v1,,False
Transformer-based Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Localization,15/01/2025,"Charalampos Shimillas, Kleanthis Malialis, Konstantinos Fokianos, Marios M. Polycarpou","With the growing complexity of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the
integration of Internet of Things (IoT), the use of sensors for online
monitoring generates large volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data.
Consequently, the need for robust anomaly diagnosis in MTS is paramount to
maintaining system reliability and safety. While significant advancements have
been made in anomaly detection, localization remains a largely underexplored
area, though crucial for intelligent decision-making. This paper introduces a
novel transformer-based model for unsupervised anomaly diagnosis in MTS, with a
focus on improving localization performance, through an in-depth analysis of
the self-attention mechanism's learning behavior under both normal and
anomalous conditions. We formulate the anomaly localization problem as a
three-stage process: time-step, window, and segment-based. This leads to the
development of the Space-Time Anomaly Score (STAS), a new metric inspired by
the connection between transformer latent representations and space-time
statistical models. STAS is designed to capture individual anomaly behaviors
and inter-series dependencies, delivering enhanced localization performance.
Additionally, the Statistical Feature Anomaly Score (SFAS) complements STAS by
analyzing statistical features around anomalies, with their combination helping
to reduce false alarms. Experiments on real world and synthetic datasets
illustrate the model's superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both
detection and localization tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08628v1,,False
CT-PatchTST: Channel-Time Patch Time-Series Transformer for Long-Term Renewable Energy Forecasting,15/01/2025,"Menghao Huo, Kuan Lu, Yuxiao Li, Qiang Zhu","Accurately predicting renewable energy output is crucial for the efficient
integration of solar and wind power into modern energy systems. This study
develops and evaluates an advanced deep learning model, Channel-Time Patch
Time-Series Transformer (CT-PatchTST), to forecast the power output of
photovoltaic and wind energy systems using annual offshore wind power, onshore
wind power, and solar power generation data from Denmark. While the original
Patch Time-Series Transformer(PatchTST) model employs a channel-independent
(CI) approach, it tends to overlook inter-channel relationships during
training, potentially leading to a loss of critical information. To address
this limitation and further leverage the benefits of increased data granularity
brought by CI, we propose CT-PatchTST. This enhanced model improves the
processing of inter-channel information while maintaining the advantages of the
channel-independent approach. The predictive performance of CT-PatchTST is
rigorously analyzed, demonstrating its ability to provide precise and reliable
energy forecasts. This work contributes to improving the predictability of
renewable energy systems, supporting their broader adoption and integration
into energy grids.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08620v1,,False
RLHS: Mitigating Misalignment in RLHF with Hindsight Simulation,15/01/2025,"Kaiqu Liang, Haimin Hu, Ryan Liu, Thomas L. Griffiths, Jaime Fernández Fisac","Generative AI systems like foundation models (FMs) must align well with human
values to ensure their behavior is helpful and trustworthy. While Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has shown promise for optimizing model
performance using human judgments, existing RLHF pipelines predominantly rely
on immediate feedback, which can fail to accurately reflect the downstream
impact of an interaction on users' utility. We demonstrate that feedback based
on evaluators' foresight estimates of downstream consequences systematically
induces Goodhart's Law dynamics, incentivizing misaligned behaviors like
sycophancy and deception and ultimately degrading user outcomes. To alleviate
this, we propose decoupling evaluation from prediction by refocusing RLHF on
hindsight feedback. Our theoretical analysis reveals that conditioning
evaluator feedback on downstream observations mitigates misalignment and
improves expected human utility, even when these observations are simulated by
the AI system itself. To leverage this insight in a practical alignment
algorithm, we introduce Reinforcement Learning from Hindsight Simulation
(RLHS), which first simulates plausible consequences and then elicits feedback
to assess what behaviors were genuinely beneficial in hindsight. We apply RLHS
to two widely-employed online and offline preference optimization methods --
Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) --
and show empirically that misalignment is significantly reduced with both
methods. Through an online human user study, we show that RLHS consistently
outperforms RLHF in helping users achieve their goals and earns higher
satisfaction ratings, despite being trained solely with simulated hindsight
feedback. These results underscore the importance of focusing on long-term
consequences, even simulated ones, to mitigate misalignment in RLHF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08617v1,,False
AutoRestTest: A Tool for Automated REST API Testing Using LLMs and MARL,15/01/2025,"Tyler Stennett, Myeongsoo Kim, Saurabh Sinha, Alessandro Orso","As REST APIs have become widespread in modern web services, comprehensive
testing of these APIs has become increasingly crucial. Due to the vast search
space consisting of operations, parameters, and parameter values along with
their complex dependencies and constraints, current testing tools suffer from
low code coverage, leading to suboptimal fault detection. To address this
limitation, we present a novel tool, AutoRestTest, which integrates the
Semantic Operation Dependency Graph (SODG) with Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) and large language models (LLMs) for effective REST API
testing. AutoRestTest determines operation-dependent parameters using the SODG
and employs five specialized agents (operation, parameter, value, dependency,
and header) to identify dependencies of operations and generate operation
sequences, parameter combinations, and values. AutoRestTest provides a
command-line interface and continuous telemetry on successful operation count,
unique server errors detected, and time elapsed. Upon completion, AutoRestTest
generates a detailed report highlighting errors detected and operations
exercised. In this paper, we introduce our tool and present preliminary
results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08600v1,,False
OpenMLDB: A Real-Time Relational Data Feature Computation System for Online ML,15/01/2025,"Xuanhe Zhou, Wei Zhou, Liguo Qi, Hao Zhang, Dihao Chen, Bingsheng He, Mian Lu, Guoliang Li, Fan Wu, Yuqiang Chen","Efficient and consistent feature computation is crucial for a wide range of
online ML applications. Typically, feature computation is divided into two
distinct phases, i.e., offline stage for model training and online stage for
model serving. These phases often rely on execution engines with different
interface languages and function implementations, causing significant
inconsistencies. Moreover, many online ML features involve complex time-series
computations (e.g., functions over varied-length table windows) that differ
from standard streaming and analytical queries. Existing data processing
systems (e.g., Spark, Flink, DuckDB) often incur multi-second latencies for
these computations, making them unsuitable for real-time online ML applications
that demand timely feature updates.
  This paper presents OpenMLDB, a feature computation system deployed in
4Paradigm's SageOne platform and over 100 real scenarios. Technically, OpenMLDB
first employs a unified query plan generator for consistent computation results
across the offline and online stages, significantly reducing feature deployment
overhead. Second, OpenMLDB provides an online execution engine that resolves
performance bottlenecks caused by long window computations (via
pre-aggregation) and multi-table window unions (via data self-adjusting). It
also provides a high-performance offline execution engine with window parallel
optimization and time-aware data skew resolving. Third, OpenMLDB features a
compact data format and stream-focused indexing to maximize memory usage and
accelerate data access. Evaluations in testing and real workloads reveal
significant performance improvements and resource savings compared to the
baseline systems. The open community of OpenMLDB now has over 150 contributors
and gained 1.6k stars on GitHub.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08591v1,,False
Reinforcement Learning-Enhanced Procedural Generation for Dynamic Narrative-Driven AR Experiences,15/01/2025,Aniruddha Srinivas Joshi,"Procedural Content Generation (PCG) is widely used to create scalable and
diverse environments in games. However, existing methods, such as the Wave
Function Collapse (WFC) algorithm, are often limited to static scenarios and
lack the adaptability required for dynamic, narrative-driven applications,
particularly in augmented reality (AR) games. This paper presents a
reinforcement learning-enhanced WFC framework designed for mobile AR
environments. By integrating environment-specific rules and dynamic tile weight
adjustments informed by reinforcement learning (RL), the proposed method
generates maps that are both contextually coherent and responsive to gameplay
needs. Comparative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that the framework
achieves superior map quality and delivers immersive experiences, making it
well-suited for narrative-driven AR games. Additionally, the method holds
promise for broader applications in education, simulation training, and
immersive extended reality (XR) experiences, where dynamic and adaptive
environments are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08552v1,,False
