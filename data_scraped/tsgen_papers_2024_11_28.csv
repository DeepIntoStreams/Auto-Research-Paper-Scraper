Cross-modal Information Flow in Multimodal Large Language Models,27/11/2024,"Zhi Zhang, Srishti Yadav, Fengze Han, Ekaterina Shutova","The recent advancements in auto-regressive multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) have demonstrated promising progress for vision-language tasks. While
there exists a variety of studies investigating the processing of linguistic
information within large language models, little is currently known about the
inner working mechanism of MLLMs and how linguistic and visual information
interact within these models. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by
examining the information flow between different modalities -- language and
vision -- in MLLMs, focusing on visual question answering. Specifically, given
an image-question pair as input, we investigate where in the model and how the
visual and linguistic information are combined to generate the final
prediction. Conducting experiments with a series of models from the LLaVA
series, we find that there are two distinct stages in the process of
integration of the two modalities. In the lower layers, the model first
transfers the more general visual features of the whole image into the
representations of (linguistic) question tokens. In the middle layers, it once
again transfers visual information about specific objects relevant to the
question to the respective token positions of the question. Finally, in the
higher layers, the resulting multimodal representation is propagated to the
last position of the input sequence for the final prediction. Overall, our
findings provide a new and comprehensive perspective on the spatial and
functional aspects of image and language processing in the MLLMs, thereby
facilitating future research into multimodal information localization and
editing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18620v1,,False
Surveying the space of descriptions of a composite system with machine learning,27/11/2024,"Kieran A. Murphy, Yujing Zhang, Dani S. Bassett","Multivariate information theory provides a general and principled framework
for understanding how the components of a complex system are connected.
Existing analyses are coarse in nature -- built up from characterizations of
discrete subsystems -- and can be computationally prohibitive. In this work, we
propose to study the continuous space of possible descriptions of a composite
system as a window into its organizational structure. A description consists of
specific information conveyed about each of the components, and the space of
possible descriptions is equivalent to the space of lossy compression schemes
of the components. We introduce a machine learning framework to optimize
descriptions that extremize key information theoretic quantities used to
characterize organization, such as total correlation and O-information. Through
case studies on spin systems, Sudoku boards, and letter sequences from natural
language, we identify extremal descriptions that reveal how system-wide
variation emerges from individual components. By integrating machine learning
into a fine-grained information theoretic analysis of composite random
variables, our framework opens a new avenues for probing the structure of
real-world complex systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18579v1,,False
Draft Model Knows When to Stop: A Self-Verification Length Policy for Speculative Decoding,27/11/2024,"Ziyin Zhang, Jiahao Xu, Tian Liang, Xingyu Chen, Zhiwei He, Rui Wang, Zhaopeng Tu","Speculative Decoding (SD) has become an important technique in accelerating
the inference speed of large language models. Conventional SD methods employ a
fixed draft length, which ignores the token generation difficulty across tasks.
Consequently, in this paper, we address such an issue and introduce SVIP - a
difficulty-aware dynamic draft length policy for speculative decoding systems.
Based on a theoretical lower bound of draft token acceptance rate and its
inference-time approximation, SVIP adaptively determines the lengths of draft
sequences based on the entropy of each draft token distribution. Experimental
results on mainstream SD benchmarks and frameworks demonstrate the superior
performance of SVIP, achieving up to 20\% walltime speedup on SpecBench over
baseline SD methods and 60\% speedup on MT-Bench for long-form generation of up
to 8K tokens. Moreover, SVIP is totally training-free and compatible with any
existing SD methods that generate draft tokens autoregressively. Experimental
results also show that SVIP yields consistent walltime improvement on top of
GliDe & CaPE and EAGLE-2.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18462v1,,False
Continuous Autoregressive Models with Noise Augmentation Avoid Error Accumulation,27/11/2024,"Marco Pasini, Javier Nistal, Stefan Lattner, George Fazekas","Autoregressive models are typically applied to sequences of discrete tokens,
but recent research indicates that generating sequences of continuous
embeddings in an autoregressive manner is also feasible. However, such
Continuous Autoregressive Models (CAMs) can suffer from a decline in generation
quality over extended sequences due to error accumulation during inference. We
introduce a novel method to address this issue by injecting random noise into
the input embeddings during training. This procedure makes the model robust
against varying error levels at inference. We further reduce error accumulation
through an inference procedure that introduces low-level noise. Experiments on
musical audio generation show that CAM substantially outperforms existing
autoregressive and non-autoregressive approaches while preserving audio quality
over extended sequences. This work paves the way for generating continuous
embeddings in a purely autoregressive setting, opening new possibilities for
real-time and interactive generative applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18447v1,,False
XR-MBT: Multi-modal Full Body Tracking for XR through Self-Supervision with Learned Depth Point Cloud Registration,27/11/2024,"Denys Rozumnyi, Nadine Bertsch, Othman Sbai, Filippo Arcadu, Yuhua Chen, Artsiom Sanakoyeu, Manoj Kumar, Catherine Herold, Robin Kips","Tracking the full body motions of users in XR (AR/VR) devices is a
fundamental challenge to bring a sense of authentic social presence. Due to the
absence of dedicated leg sensors, currently available body tracking methods
adopt a synthesis approach to generate plausible motions given a 3-point signal
from the head and controller tracking. In order to enable mixed reality
features, modern XR devices are capable of estimating depth information of the
headset surroundings using available sensors combined with dedicated machine
learning models. Such egocentric depth sensing cannot drive the body directly,
as it is not registered and is incomplete due to limited field-of-view and body
self-occlusions. For the first time, we propose to leverage the available depth
sensing signal combined with self-supervision to learn a multi-modal pose
estimation model capable of tracking full body motions in real time on XR
devices. We demonstrate how current 3-point motion synthesis models can be
extended to point cloud modalities using a semantic point cloud encoder network
combined with a residual network for multi-modal pose estimation. These modules
are trained jointly in a self-supervised way, leveraging a combination of real
unregistered point clouds and simulated data obtained from motion capture. We
compare our approach against several state-of-the-art systems for XR body
tracking and show that our method accurately tracks a diverse range of body
motions. XR-MBT tracks legs in XR for the first time, whereas traditional
synthesis approaches based on partial body tracking are blind.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18377v1,,False
G3Flow: Generative 3D Semantic Flow for Pose-aware and Generalizable Object Manipulation,27/11/2024,"Tianxing Chen, Yao Mu, Zhixuan Liang, Zanxin Chen, Shijia Peng, Qiangyu Chen, Mingkun Xu, Ruizhen Hu, Hongyuan Zhang, Xuelong Li, Ping Luo","Recent advances in imitation learning for 3D robotic manipulation have shown
promising results with diffusion-based policies. However, achieving human-level
dexterity requires seamless integration of geometric precision and semantic
understanding. We present G3Flow, a novel framework that constructs real-time
semantic flow, a dynamic, object-centric 3D semantic representation by
leveraging foundation models. Our approach uniquely combines 3D generative
models for digital twin creation, vision foundation models for semantic feature
extraction, and robust pose tracking for continuous semantic flow updates. This
integration enables complete semantic understanding even under occlusions while
eliminating manual annotation requirements. By incorporating semantic flow into
diffusion policies, we demonstrate significant improvements in both
terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object generalization. Extensive
experiments across five simulation tasks show that G3Flow consistently
outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 68.3% and 50.1% average
success rates on terminal-constrained manipulation and cross-object
generalization tasks respectively. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of
G3Flow in enhancing real-time dynamic semantic feature understanding for
robotic manipulation policies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18369v1,,False
Ridge Regression for Manifold-valued Time-Series with Application to Meteorological Forecast,27/11/2024,Esfandiar Nava-Yazdani,"We propose a natural intrinsic extension of the ridge regression from
Euclidean spaces to general manifolds, which relies on Riemannian least-squares
fitting, empirical covariance, and Mahalanobis distance. We utilize it for
time-series prediction and apply the approach to forecast hurricane tracks and
their wind speeds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18339v1,,False
GAPartManip: A Large-scale Part-centric Dataset for Material-Agnostic Articulated Object Manipulation,27/11/2024,"Wenbo Cui, Chengyang Zhao, Songlin Wei, Jiazhao Zhang, Haoran Geng, Yaran Chen, He Wang","Effectively manipulating articulated objects in household scenarios is a
crucial step toward achieving general embodied artificial intelligence.
Mainstream research in 3D vision has primarily focused on manipulation through
depth perception and pose detection. However, in real-world environments, these
methods often face challenges due to imperfect depth perception, such as with
transparent lids and reflective handles. Moreover, they generally lack the
diversity in part-based interactions required for flexible and adaptable
manipulation. To address these challenges, we introduced a large-scale
part-centric dataset for articulated object manipulation that features both
photo-realistic material randomizations and detailed annotations of
part-oriented, scene-level actionable interaction poses. We evaluated the
effectiveness of our dataset by integrating it with several state-of-the-art
methods for depth estimation and interaction pose prediction. Additionally, we
proposed a novel modular framework that delivers superior and robust
performance for generalizable articulated object manipulation. Our extensive
experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves the performance
of depth perception and actionable interaction pose prediction in both
simulation and real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18276v1,,False
Dynamic Retail Pricing via Q-Learning -- A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Enhanced Revenue Management,27/11/2024,"Mohit Apte, Ketan Kale, Pranav Datar, Pratiksha Deshmukh","This paper explores the application of a reinforcement learning (RL)
framework using the Q-Learning algorithm to enhance dynamic pricing strategies
in the retail sector. Unlike traditional pricing methods, which often rely on
static demand models, our RL approach continuously adapts to evolving market
dynamics, offering a more flexible and responsive pricing strategy. By creating
a simulated retail environment, we demonstrate how RL effectively addresses
real-time changes in consumer behavior and market conditions, leading to
improved revenue outcomes. Our results illustrate that the RL model not only
surpasses traditional methods in terms of revenue generation but also provides
insights into the complex interplay of price elasticity and consumer demand.
This research underlines the significant potential of applying artificial
intelligence in economic decision-making, paving the way for more
sophisticated, data-driven pricing models in various commercial domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18261v1,,False
Thai Financial Domain Adaptation of THaLLE -- Technical Report,27/11/2024,"KBTG Labs, Atthakorn Petchsod, Pornchanan Balee, Danupat Khamnuansin, Anuruth Lertpiya, Chanatip Saetia, Tawunrat Chalothorn, Thadpong Pongthawornkamol, Monchai Lertsutthiwong","Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in general tasks but struggle with
domain-specific challenges, such as specialized terminology and localized
regulations. Existing financial LLMs, like FinGPT and BloombergGPT, lack
support for the Thai financial domain. We developed a Thai Financial LLM using
the Investment Consultant (IC) exam dataset from the Stock Exchange of
Thailand. To address dataset limitations, we applied data augmentation, ReLoRA

Rank-Stabilized LoRA (rsLoRA) for fine-tuning. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)

Dependency-Aware CAV Task Scheduling via Diffusion-Based Reinforcement Learning,27/11/2024,"Xiang Cheng, Zhi Mao, Ying Wang, Wen Wu","In this paper, we propose a novel dependency-aware task scheduling strategy
for dynamic unmanned aerial vehicle-assisted connected autonomous vehicles
(CAVs). Specifically, different computation tasks of CAVs consisting of
multiple dependency subtasks are judiciously assigned to nearby CAVs or the
base station for promptly completing tasks. Therefore, we formulate a joint
scheduling priority and subtask assignment optimization problem with the
objective of minimizing the average task completion time. The problem aims at
improving the long-term system performance, which is reformulated as a Markov
decision process. To solve the problem, we further propose a diffusion-based
reinforcement learning algorithm, named Synthetic DDQN based Subtasks
Scheduling, which can make adaptive task scheduling decision in real time. A
diffusion model-based synthetic experience replay is integrated into the
reinforcement learning framework, which can generate sufficient synthetic data
in experience replay buffer, thereby significantly accelerating convergence and
improving sample efficiency. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed algorithm on reducing task completion time, comparing to
benchmark schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18230v1,,False
SALMONN-omni: A Codec-free LLM for Full-duplex Speech Understanding and Generation,27/11/2024,"Wenyi Yu, Siyin Wang, Xiaoyu Yang, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Guangzhi Sun, Lu Lu, Yuxuan Wang, Chao Zhang","Full-duplex multimodal large language models (LLMs) provide a unified
framework for addressing diverse speech understanding and generation tasks,
enabling more natural and seamless human-machine conversations. Unlike
traditional modularised conversational AI systems, which separate speech
recognition, understanding, and text-to-speech generation into distinct
components, multimodal LLMs operate as single end-to-end models. This
streamlined design eliminates error propagation across components and fully
leverages the rich non-verbal information embedded in input speech signals. We
introduce SALMONN-omni, a codec-free, full-duplex speech understanding and
generation model capable of simultaneously listening to its own generated
speech and background sounds while speaking. To support this capability, we
propose a novel duplex spoken dialogue framework incorporating a ``thinking''
mechanism that facilitates asynchronous text and speech generation relying on
embeddings instead of codecs (quantized speech and audio tokens). Experimental
results demonstrate SALMONN-omni's versatility across a broad range of
streaming speech tasks, including speech recognition, speech enhancement, and
spoken question answering. Additionally, SALMONN-omni excels at managing
turn-taking, barge-in, and echo cancellation scenarios, establishing its
potential as a robust prototype for full-duplex conversational AI systems. To
the best of our knowledge, SALMONN-omni is the first codec-free model of its
kind. A full technical report along with model checkpoints will be released
soon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18138v1,,False
The Bigger the Better? Accurate Molecular Potential Energy Surfaces from Minimalist Neural Networks,27/11/2024,"Silvan Käser, Debasish Koner, Markus Meuwly","Atomistic simulations are a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of
molecules, proteins, and materials on wide time and length scales. Their
reliability and predictiveness, however, depend directly on the accuracy of the
underlying potential energy surface (PES). Guided by the principle of parsimony
this work introduces KerNN, a combined kernel/neural network-based approach to
represent molecular PESs. Compared to state-of-the-art neural network PESs the
number of learnable parameters of KerNN is significantly reduced. This speeds
up training and evaluation times by several orders of magnitude while retaining
high prediction accuracy. Importantly, using kernels as the features also
improves the extrapolation capabilities of KerNN far beyond the coverage
provided by the training data which solves a general problem of NN-based PESs.
KerNN applied to spectroscopy and reaction dynamics shows excellent performance
on test set statistics and observables including vibrational bands computed
from classical and quantum simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18121v1,,False
Heterogeneous Relationships of Subjects and Shapelets for Semi-supervised Multivariate Series Classification,27/11/2024,"Mingsen Du, Meng Chen, Yongjian Li, Cun Ji, Shoushui Wei","Multivariate time series (MTS) classification is widely applied in fields
such as industry, healthcare, and finance, aiming to extract key features from
complex time series data for accurate decision-making and prediction. However,
existing methods for MTS often struggle due to the challenges of effectively
modeling high-dimensional data and the lack of labeled data, resulting in poor
classification performance. To address this issue, we propose a heterogeneous
relationships of subjects and shapelets method for semi-supervised MTS
classification. This method offers a novel perspective by integrating various
types of additional information while capturing the relationships between them.
Specifically, we first utilize a contrast temporal self-attention module to
obtain sparse MTS representations, and then model the similarities between
these representations using soft dynamic time warping to construct a similarity
graph. Secondly, we learn the shapelets for different subject types,
incorporating both the subject features and their shapelets as additional
information to further refine the similarity graph, ultimately generating a
heterogeneous graph. Finally, we use a dual level graph attention network to
get prediction. Through this method, we successfully transform dataset into a
heterogeneous graph, integrating multiple additional information and achieving
precise semi-supervised node classification. Experiments on the Human Activity
Recognition, sleep stage classification and University of East Anglia datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in MTS
classification tasks, validating its superiority.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18043v1,,False
Diffeomorphic Latent Neural Operator Learning for Data-Efficient Predictions of Solutions to Partial Differential Equations,27/11/2024,"Zan Ahmad, Shiyi Chen, Minglang Yin, Avisha Kumar, Nicolas Charon, Natalia Trayanova, Mauro Maggioni","A computed approximation of the solution operator to a system of partial
differential equations (PDEs) is needed in various areas of science and
engineering. Neural operators have been shown to be quite effective at
predicting these solution generators after training on high-fidelity ground
truth data (e.g. numerical simulations). However, in order to generalize well
to unseen spatial domains, neural operators must be trained on an extensive
amount of geometrically varying data samples that may not be feasible to
acquire or simulate in certain contexts (i.e., patient-specific medical data,
large-scale computationally intensive simulations.) We propose that in order to
learn a PDE solution operator that can generalize across multiple domains
without needing to sample enough data expressive enough for all possible
geometries, we can train instead a latent neural operator on just a few ground
truth solution fields diffeomorphically mapped from different geometric/spatial
domains to a fixed reference configuration. Furthermore, the form of the
solutions is dependent on the choice of mapping to and from the reference
domain. We emphasize that preserving properties of the differential operator
when constructing these mappings can significantly reduce the data requirement
for achieving an accurate model due to the regularity of the solution fields
that the latent neural operator is training on. We provide motivating numerical
experimentation that demonstrates an extreme case of this consideration by
exploiting the conformal invariance of the Laplacian",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.18014v1,,False
Optimized Conformal Selection: Powerful Selective Inference After Conformity Score Optimization,27/11/2024,"Tian Bai, Ying Jin","Model selection/optimization in conformal inference is challenging, since it
may break the exchangeability between labeled and unlabeled data. We study this
problem in the context of conformal selection, which uses conformal p-values to
select ``interesting'' instances with large unobserved labels from a pool of
unlabeled data, while controlling the FDR in finite sample. For validity,
existing solutions require the model choice to be independent of the data used
to construct the p-values and calibrate the selection set. However, when
presented with many model choices and limited labeled data, it is desirable to
(i) select the best model in a data-driven manner, and (ii) mitigate power loss
due to sample splitting.
  This paper presents OptCS, a general framework that allows valid statistical
testing (selection) after flexible data-driven model optimization. We introduce
general conditions under which OptCS constructs valid conformal p-values
despite substantial data reuse and handles complex p-value dependencies to
maintain finite-sample FDR control via a novel multiple testing procedure. We
instantiate this general recipe to propose three FDR-controlling procedures,
each optimizing the models differently: (i) selecting the most powerful one
among multiple pre-trained candidate models, (ii) using all data for model
fitting without sample splitting, and (iii) combining full-sample model fitting
and selection. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods via simulation
studies and real applications in drug discovery and alignment of large language
models in radiology report generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17983v1,,False
