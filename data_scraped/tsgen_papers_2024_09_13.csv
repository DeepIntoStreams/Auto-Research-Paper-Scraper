OmniQuery: Contextually Augmenting Captured Multimodal Memory to Enable Personal Question Answering,12/09/2024,"Jiahao Nick Li, Zhuohao, Zhang, Jiaju Ma","People often capture memories through photos, screenshots, and videos. While
existing AI-based tools enable querying this data using natural language, they
mostly only support retrieving individual pieces of information like certain
objects in photos and struggle with answering more complex queries that involve
interpreting interconnected memories like event sequences. We conducted a
one-month diary study to collect realistic user queries and generated a
taxonomy of necessary contextual information for integrating with captured
memories. We then introduce OmniQuery, a novel system that is able to answer
complex personal memory-related questions that require extracting and inferring
contextual information. OmniQuery augments single captured memories through
integrating scattered contextual information from multiple interconnected
memories, retrieves relevant memories, and uses a large language model (LLM) to
comprehensive answers. In human evaluations, we show the effectiveness of
OmniQuery with an accuracy of 71.5%, and it outperformed a conventional RAG
system, winning or tying in 74.5% of the time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08250v1,,False
Machine Learning for Two-Sample Testing under Right-Censored Data: A Simulation Study,12/09/2024,"Petr Philonenko, Sergey Postovalov","The focus of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Machine Learning
(ML) methods for two-sample testing with right-censored observations. To
achieve this, we develop several ML-based methods with varying architectures
and implement them as two-sample tests. Each method is an ensemble (stacking)
that combines predictions from classical two-sample tests. This paper presents
the results of training the proposed ML methods, examines their statistical
power compared to classical two-sample tests, analyzes the distribution of test
statistics for the proposed methods when the null hypothesis is true, and
evaluates the significance of the features incorporated into the proposed
methods. All results from numerical experiments were obtained from a synthetic
dataset generated using the Smirnov transform (Inverse Transform Sampling) and
replicated multiple times through Monte Carlo simulation. To test the
two-sample problem with right-censored observations, one can use the proposed
two-sample methods. All necessary materials (source code, example scripts,
dataset, and samples) are available on GitHub and Hugging Face.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08201v1,,False
Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer for Offline Reinforcement Learning,12/09/2024,"Teng Yan, Zhendong Ruan, Yaobang Cai, Yu Han, Wenxian Li, Yang Zhang","As a data-driven paradigm, offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) has
been formulated as sequence modeling, where the Decision Transformer (DT) has
demonstrated exceptional capabilities. Unlike previous reinforcement learning
methods that fit value functions or compute policy gradients, DT adjusts the
autoregressive model based on the expected returns, past states, and actions,
using a causally masked Transformer to output the optimal action. However, due
to the inconsistency between the sampled returns within a single trajectory and
the optimal returns across multiple trajectories, it is challenging to set an
expected return to output the optimal action and stitch together suboptimal
trajectories. Decision ConvFormer (DC) is easier to understand in the context
of modeling RL trajectories within a Markov Decision Process compared to DT. We
propose the Q-value Regularized Decision ConvFormer (QDC), which combines the
understanding of RL trajectories by DC and incorporates a term that maximizes
action values using dynamic programming methods during training. This ensures
that the expected returns of the sampled actions are consistent with the
optimal returns. QDC achieves excellent performance on the D4RL benchmark,
outperforming or approaching the optimal level in all tested environments. It
particularly demonstrates outstanding competitiveness in trajectory stitching
capability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08062v1,,False
"From Explanations to Action: A Zero-Shot, Theory-Driven LLM Framework for Student Performance Feedback",12/09/2024,"Vinitra Swamy, Davide Romano, Bhargav Srinivasa Desikan, Oana-Maria Camburu, Tanja Käser","Recent advances in eXplainable AI (XAI) for education have highlighted a
critical challenge: ensuring that explanations for state-of-the-art AI models
are understandable for non-technical users such as educators and students. In
response, we introduce iLLuMinaTE, a zero-shot, chain-of-prompts LLM-XAI
pipeline inspired by Miller's cognitive model of explanation. iLLuMinaTE is
designed to deliver theory-driven, actionable feedback to students in online
courses. iLLuMinaTE navigates three main stages - causal connection,
explanation selection, and explanation presentation - with variations drawing
from eight social science theories (e.g. Abnormal Conditions, Pearl's Model of
Explanation, Necessity and Robustness Selection, Contrastive Explanation). We
extensively evaluate 21,915 natural language explanations of iLLuMinaTE
extracted from three LLMs (GPT-4o, Gemma2-9B, Llama3-70B), with three different
underlying XAI methods (LIME, Counterfactuals, MC-LIME), across students from
three diverse online courses. Our evaluation involves analyses of explanation
alignment to the social science theory, understandability of the explanation,
and a real-world user preference study with 114 university students containing
a novel actionability simulation. We find that students prefer iLLuMinaTE
explanations over traditional explainers 89.52% of the time. Our work provides
a robust, ready-to-use framework for effectively communicating hybrid
XAI-driven insights in education, with significant generalization potential for
other human-centric fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08027v1,,False
Autonomous Vehicle Controllers From End-to-End Differentiable Simulation,12/09/2024,"Asen Nachkov, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool","Current methods to learn controllers for autonomous vehicles (AVs) focus on
behavioural cloning. Being trained only on exact historic data, the resulting
agents often generalize poorly to novel scenarios. Simulators provide the
opportunity to go beyond offline datasets, but they are still treated as
complicated black boxes, only used to update the global simulation state. As a
result, these RL algorithms are slow, sample-inefficient, and prior-agnostic.
In this work, we leverage a differentiable simulator and design an analytic
policy gradients (APG) approach to training AV controllers on the large-scale
Waymo Open Motion Dataset. Our proposed framework brings the differentiable
simulator into an end-to-end training loop, where gradients of the environment
dynamics serve as a useful prior to help the agent learn a more grounded
policy. We combine this setup with a recurrent architecture that can
efficiently propagate temporal information across long simulated trajectories.
This APG method allows us to learn robust, accurate, and fast policies, while
only requiring widely-available expert trajectories, instead of scarce expert
actions. We compare to behavioural cloning and find significant improvements in
performance and robustness to noise in the dynamics, as well as overall more
intuitive human-like handling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07965v1,,False
Randomized Spline Trees for Functional Data Classification: Theory and Application to Environmental Time Series,12/09/2024,"Donato Riccio, Fabrizio Maturo, Elvira Romano","Functional data analysis (FDA) and ensemble learning can be powerful tools
for analyzing complex environmental time series. Recent literature has
highlighted the key role of diversity in enhancing accuracy and reducing
variance in ensemble methods.This paper introduces Randomized Spline Trees
(RST), a novel algorithm that bridges these two approaches by incorporating
randomized functional representations into the Random Forest framework. RST
generates diverse functional representations of input data using randomized
B-spline parameters, creating an ensemble of decision trees trained on these
varied representations. We provide a theoretical analysis of how this
functional diversity contributes to reducing generalization error and present
empirical evaluations on six environmental time series classification tasks
from the UCR Time Series Archive. Results show that RST variants outperform
standard Random Forests and Gradient Boosting on most datasets, improving
classification accuracy by up to 14\%. The success of RST demonstrates the
potential of adaptive functional representations in capturing complex temporal
patterns in environmental data. This work contributes to the growing field of
machine learning techniques focused on functional data and opens new avenues
for research in environmental time series analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07879v1,,False
TSELM: Target Speaker Extraction using Discrete Tokens and Language Models,12/09/2024,"Beilong Tang, Bang Zeng, Ming Li","We propose TSELM, a novel target speaker extraction network that leverages
discrete tokens and language models. TSELM utilizes multiple discretized layers
from WavLM as input tokens and incorporates cross-attention mechanisms to
integrate target speaker information. Language models are employed to capture
the sequence dependencies, while a scalable HiFi-GAN is used to reconstruct the
audio from the tokens. By applying a cross-entropy loss, TSELM models the
probability distribution of output tokens, thus converting the complex
regression problem of audio generation into a classification task. Experimental
results show that TSELM achieves excellent results in speech quality and
comparable results in speech intelligibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07841v1,,False
ReGentS: Real-World Safety-Critical Driving Scenario Generation Made Stable,12/09/2024,"Yuan Yin, Pegah Khayatan, Éloi Zablocki, Alexandre Boulch, Matthieu Cord","Machine learning based autonomous driving systems often face challenges with
safety-critical scenarios that are rare in real-world data, hindering their
large-scale deployment. While increasing real-world training data coverage
could address this issue, it is costly and dangerous. This work explores
generating safety-critical driving scenarios by modifying complex real-world
regular scenarios through trajectory optimization. We propose ReGentS, which
stabilizes generated trajectories and introduces heuristics to avoid obvious
collisions and optimization problems. Our approach addresses unrealistic
diverging trajectories and unavoidable collision scenarios that are not useful
for training robust planner. We also extend the scenario generation framework
to handle real-world data with up to 32 agents. Additionally, by using a
differentiable simulator, our approach simplifies gradient descent-based
optimization involving a simulator, paving the way for future advancements. The
code is available at https://github.com/valeoai/ReGentS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07830v1,,False
Relevance for Human Robot Collaboration,12/09/2024,"Xiaotong Zhang, Dingcheng Huang, Kamal Youcef-Toumi","Effective human-robot collaboration (HRC) requires the robots to possess
human-like intelligence. Inspired by the human's cognitive ability to
selectively process and filter elements in complex environments, this paper
introduces a novel concept and scene-understanding approach termed `relevance.'
It identifies relevant components in a scene. To accurately and efficiently
quantify relevance, we developed an event-based framework that selectively
triggers relevance determination, along with a probabilistic methodology built
on a structured scene representation. Simulation results demonstrate that the
relevance framework and methodology accurately predict the relevance of a
general HRC setup, achieving a precision of 0.99 and a recall of 0.94.
Relevance can be broadly applied to several areas in HRC to improve task
planning time by 79.56% compared with pure planning for a cereal task, reduce
perception latency by up to 26.53% for an object detector, improve HRC safety
by up to 13.50% and reduce the number of inquiries for HRC by 75.36%. A
real-world demonstration showcases the relevance framework's ability to
intelligently assist humans in everyday tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.07753v1,,False
