Nonparametric learning of stochastic differential equations from sparse and noisy data,15/08/2025,"Arnab Ganguly, Riten Mitra, Jinpu Zhou","The paper proposes a systematic framework for building data-driven stochastic
differential equation (SDE) models from sparse, noisy observations. Unlike
traditional parametric approaches, which assume a known functional form for the
drift, our goal here is to learn the entire drift function directly from data
without strong structural assumptions, making it especially relevant in
scientific disciplines where system dynamics are partially understood or highly
complex. We cast the estimation problem as minimization of the penalized
negative log-likelihood functional over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space
(RKHS). In the sparse observation regime, the presence of unobserved trajectory
segments makes the SDE likelihood intractable. To address this, we develop an
Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm that employs a novel Sequential Monte
Carlo (SMC) method to approximate the filtering distribution and generate Monte
Carlo estimates of the E-step objective. The M-step then reduces to a penalized
empirical risk minimization problem in the RKHS, whose minimizer is given by a
finite linear combination of kernel functions via a generalized representer
theorem. To control model complexity across EM iterations, we also develop a
hybrid Bayesian variant of the algorithm that uses shrinkage priors to identify
significant coefficients in the kernel expansion. We establish important
theoretical convergence results for both the exact and approximate EM
sequences. The resulting EM-SMC-RKHS procedure enables accurate estimation of
the drift function of stochastic dynamical systems in low-data regimes and is
broadly applicable across domains requiring continuous-time modeling under
observational constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method
through a series of numerical experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11597v1,,False
Physics-Informed Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time Series,15/08/2025,"Juhi Soni, Markus Lange-Hegermann, Stefan Windmann","We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a
physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the
past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting,
imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In
this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent
temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted
physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted
physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This
approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data
distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection
performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it
generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms
baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and
purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world
dataset while remaining competitive on others.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11528v1,,False
Sim2Dust: Mastering Dynamic Waypoint Tracking on Granular Media,15/08/2025,"Andrej Orsula, Matthieu Geist, Miguel Olivares-Mendez, Carol Martinez","Reliable autonomous navigation across the unstructured terrains of distant
planetary surfaces is a critical enabler for future space exploration. However,
the deployment of learning-based controllers is hindered by the inherent
sim-to-real gap, particularly for the complex dynamics of wheel interactions
with granular media. This work presents a complete sim-to-real framework for
developing and validating robust control policies for dynamic waypoint tracking
on such challenging surfaces. We leverage massively parallel simulation to
train reinforcement learning agents across a vast distribution of procedurally
generated environments with randomized physics. These policies are then
transferred zero-shot to a physical wheeled rover operating in a lunar-analogue
facility. Our experiments systematically compare multiple reinforcement
learning algorithms and action smoothing filters to identify the most effective
combinations for real-world deployment. Crucially, we provide strong empirical
evidence that agents trained with procedural diversity achieve superior
zero-shot performance compared to those trained on static scenarios. We also
analyze the trade-offs of fine-tuning with high-fidelity particle physics,
which offers minor gains in low-speed precision at a significant computational
cost. Together, these contributions establish a validated workflow for creating
reliable learning-based navigation systems, marking a critical step towards
deploying autonomous robots in the final frontier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11503v1,,False
Inclusion Arena: An Open Platform for Evaluating Large Foundation Models with Real-World Apps,15/08/2025,"Kangyu Wang, Hongliang He, Lin Liu, Ruiqi Liang, Zhenzhong Lan, Jianguo Li","Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is
publicly accessible at https://doraemon.alipay.com/model-ranking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11452v1,,False
Generative Co-Design of Antibody Sequences and Structures via Black-Box Guidance in a Shared Latent Space,15/08/2025,"Yinghua Yao, Yuangang Pan, Xixian Chen","Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of
antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context.
However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space,
leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search
process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a
sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and
structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can
not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure
synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a
black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many
property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate
that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and
multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half
while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is
available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11424v1,,False
Trustworthy AI Psychotherapy: Multi-Agent LLM Workflow for Counseling and Explainable Mental Disorder Diagnosis,15/08/2025,"Mithat Can Ozgun, Jiahuan Pei, Koen Hindriks, Lucia Donatelli, Qingzhi Liu, Xin Sun, Junxiao Wang","LLM-based agents have emerged as transformative tools capable of executing
complex tasks through iterative planning and action, achieving significant
advancements in understanding and addressing user needs. Yet, their
effectiveness remains limited in specialized domains such as mental health
diagnosis, where they underperform compared to general applications. Current
approaches to integrating diagnostic capabilities into LLMs rely on scarce,
highly sensitive mental health datasets, which are challenging to acquire.
These methods also fail to emulate clinicians' proactive inquiry skills, lack
multi-turn conversational comprehension, and struggle to align outputs with
expert clinical reasoning. To address these gaps, we propose DSM5AgentFlow, the
first LLM-based agent workflow designed to autonomously generate DSM-5 Level-1
diagnostic questionnaires. By simulating therapist-client dialogues with
specific client profiles, the framework delivers transparent, step-by-step
disorder predictions, producing explainable and trustworthy results. This
workflow serves as a complementary tool for mental health diagnosis, ensuring
adherence to ethical and legal standards. Through comprehensive experiments, we
evaluate leading LLMs across three critical dimensions: conversational realism,
diagnostic accuracy, and explainability. Our datasets and implementations are
fully open-sourced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11398v1,,False
Fusing Rewards and Preferences in Reinforcement Learning,15/08/2025,"Sadegh Khorasani, Saber Salehkaleybar, Negar Kiyavash, Matthias Grossglauser","We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that
fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a
single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model
the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step.
Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or
trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an
off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing
DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences
matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more
stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under
Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and
approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11363v1,,False
Air Quality PM2.5 Index Prediction Model Based on CNN-LSTM,15/08/2025,"Zicheng Guo, Shuqi Wu, Meixing Zhu, He Guandi","With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air
quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly
important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban
management. To address this, we propose an air quality PM2.5 index prediction
model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in
time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial
area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5
concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,
and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over
6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in
both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in
real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,
due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high
computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors
still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability
and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11215v1,,False
Visuomotor Grasping with World Models for Surgical Robots,15/08/2025,"Hongbin Lin, Bin Li, Kwok Wai Samuel Au","Grasping is a fundamental task in robot-assisted surgery (RAS), and
automating it can reduce surgeon workload while enhancing efficiency, safety,
and consistency beyond teleoperated systems. Most prior approaches rely on
explicit object pose tracking or handcrafted visual features, limiting their
generalization to novel objects, robustness to visual disturbances, and the
ability to handle deformable objects. Visuomotor learning offers a promising
alternative, but deploying it in RAS presents unique challenges, such as low
signal-to-noise ratio in visual observations, demands for high safety and
millimeter-level precision, as well as the complex surgical environment. This
paper addresses three key challenges: (i) sim-to-real transfer of visuomotor
policies to ex vivo surgical scenes, (ii) visuomotor learning using only a
single stereo camera pair -- the standard RAS setup, and (iii) object-agnostic
grasping with a single policy that generalizes to diverse, unseen surgical
objects without retraining or task-specific models. We introduce Grasp Anything
for Surgery V2 (GASv2), a visuomotor learning framework for surgical grasping.
GASv2 leverages a world-model-based architecture and a surgical perception
pipeline for visual observations, combined with a hybrid control system for
safe execution. We train the policy in simulation using domain randomization
for sim-to-real transfer and deploy it on a real robot in both phantom-based
and ex vivo surgical settings, using only a single pair of endoscopic cameras.
Extensive experiments show our policy achieves a 65% success rate in both
settings, generalizes to unseen objects and grippers, and adapts to diverse
disturbances, demonstrating strong performance, generality, and robustness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11200v1,,False
Actor-Critic for Continuous Action Chunks: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Long-Horizon Robotic Manipulation with Sparse Reward,15/08/2025,"Jiarui Yang, Bin Zhu, Jingjing Chen, Yu-Gang Jiang","Existing reinforcement learning (RL) methods struggle with long-horizon
robotic manipulation tasks, particularly those involving sparse rewards. While
action chunking is a promising paradigm for robotic manipulation, using RL to
directly learn continuous action chunks in a stable and data-efficient manner
remains a critical challenge. This paper introduces AC3 (Actor-Critic for
Continuous Chunks), a novel RL framework that learns to generate
high-dimensional, continuous action sequences. To make this learning process
stable and data-efficient, AC3 incorporates targeted stabilization mechanisms
for both the actor and the critic. First, to ensure reliable policy
improvement, the actor is trained with an asymmetric update rule, learning
exclusively from successful trajectories. Second, to enable effective value
learning despite sparse rewards, the critic's update is stabilized using
intra-chunk $n$-step returns and further enriched by a self-supervised module
providing intrinsic rewards at anchor points aligned with each action chunk. We
conducted extensive experiments on 25 tasks from the BiGym and RLBench
benchmarks. Results show that by using only a few demonstrations and a simple
model architecture, AC3 achieves superior success rates on most tasks,
validating its effective design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.11143v1,,False
