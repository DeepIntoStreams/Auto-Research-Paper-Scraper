ARC-NCA: Towards Developmental Solutions to the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus,13/05/2025,"Etienne Guichard, Felix Reimers, Mia Kvalsund, Mikkel Lepperød, Stefano Nichele","The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), later renamed ARC-AGI, poses a
fundamental challenge in artificial general intelligence (AGI), requiring
solutions that exhibit robust abstraction and reasoning capabilities across
diverse tasks, while only few (with median count of three) correct examples are
presented. While ARC-AGI remains very challenging for artificial intelligence
systems, it is rather easy for humans. This paper introduces ARC-NCA, a
developmental approach leveraging standard Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) and
NCA enhanced with hidden memories (EngramNCA) to tackle the ARC-AGI benchmark.
NCAs are employed for their inherent ability to simulate complex dynamics and
emergent patterns, mimicking developmental processes observed in biological
systems. Developmental solutions may offer a promising avenue for enhancing
AI's problem-solving capabilities beyond mere training data extrapolation.
ARC-NCA demonstrates how integrating developmental principles into
computational models can foster adaptive reasoning and abstraction. We show
that our ARC-NCA proof-of-concept results may be comparable to, and sometimes
surpass, that of ChatGPT 4.5, at a fraction of the cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08778v1,,False
Implet: A Post-hoc Subsequence Explainer for Time Series Models,13/05/2025,"Fanyu Meng, Ziwen Kan, Shahbaz Rezaei, Zhaodan Kong, Xin Chen, Xin Liu","Explainability in time series models is crucial for fostering trust,
facilitating debugging, and ensuring interpretability in real-world
applications. In this work, we introduce Implet, a novel post-hoc explainer
that generates accurate and concise subsequence-level explanations for time
series models. Our approach identifies critical temporal segments that
significantly contribute to the model's predictions, providing enhanced
interpretability beyond traditional feature-attribution methods. Based on it,
we propose a cohort-based (group-level) explanation framework designed to
further improve the conciseness and interpretability of our explanations. We
evaluate Implet on several standard time-series classification benchmarks,
demonstrating its effectiveness in improving interpretability. The code is

Towards Foundation Models for Experimental Readout Systems Combining Discrete and Continuous Data,13/05/2025,"James Giroux, Cristiano Fanelli","We present a (proto) Foundation Model for Nuclear Physics, capable of
operating on low-level detector inputs from Imaging Cherenkov Detectors at the
future Electron Ion Collider. To address limitations in existing next-token
prediction approaches-namely resolution loss from VQ-VAE tokenization and lack
of conditional generation-we propose three key innovations: (i) separate
vocabularies for discrete spatial features and continuous variates, combined
via Causal Multi-Head Cross-Attention (CMHCA), (ii) continuous kinematic
conditioning through prepended context embeddings, and (iii) scalable and
simple, high-resolution continuous variate tokenization without joint
vocabulary inflation. Our model enables fast, high-fidelity generation of pixel
and time sequences for Cherenkov photons, validated through closure tests in
the High Performance DIRC. We also show our model generalizes to reconstruction
tasks such as pion and kaon identification, in which we show its ability to
leverage fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08736v1,,False
Memorization-Compression Cycles Improve Generalization,13/05/2025,Fangyuan Yu,"We prove theoretically that generalization improves not only through data
scaling but also by compressing internal representations. To operationalize
this insight, we introduce the Information Bottleneck Language Modeling (IBLM)
objective, which reframes language modeling as a constrained optimization
problem: minimizing representation entropy subject to optimal prediction
performance. Empirically, we observe an emergent memorization-compression cycle
during LLM pretraining, evidenced by oscillation positive/negative gradient
alignment between cross-entropy and Matrix-Based Entropy (MBE), a measure of
representation entropy. This pattern closely mirrors the predictive-compressive
trade-off prescribed by IBLM and also parallels the biological alternation
between awake learning and sleep consolidation. Motivated by this observation,
we propose Gated Phase Transition (GAPT), a training algorithm that adaptively
switches between memorization and compression phases. When applied to GPT-2
pretraining on FineWeb dataset, GAPT reduces MBE by 50% and improves
cross-entropy by 4.8%. GAPT improves OOD generalizatino by 35% in a pretraining
task on arithmetic multiplication. In a setting designed to simulate
catastrophic forgetting, GAPT reduces interference by compressing and
separating representations, achieving a 97% improvement in separation -
paralleling the functional role of sleep consolidation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08727v1,,False
Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based Amortized Bayesian Inference for Computationally Expensive Models,13/05/2025,"Stefania Scheurer, Philipp Reiser, Tim Brünnette, Wolfgang Nowak, Anneli Guthke, Paul-Christian Bürkner","Bayesian inference typically relies on a large number of model evaluations to
estimate posterior distributions. Established methods like Markov Chain Monte
Carlo (MCMC) and Amortized Bayesian Inference (ABI) can become computationally
challenging. While ABI enables fast inference after training, generating
sufficient training data still requires thousands of model simulations, which
is infeasible for expensive models. Surrogate models offer a solution by
providing approximate simulations at a lower computational cost, allowing the
generation of large data sets for training. However, the introduced
approximation errors and uncertainties can lead to overconfident posterior
estimates. To address this, we propose Uncertainty-Aware Surrogate-based
Amortized Bayesian Inference (UA-SABI) - a framework that combines surrogate
modeling and ABI while explicitly quantifying and propagating surrogate
uncertainties through the inference pipeline. Our experiments show that this
approach enables reliable, fast, and repeated Bayesian inference for
computationally expensive models, even under tight time constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08683v1,,False
WixQA: A Multi-Dataset Benchmark for Enterprise Retrieval-Augmented Generation,13/05/2025,"Dvir Cohen, Lin Burg, Sviatoslav Pykhnivskyi, Hagit Gur, Stanislav Kovynov, Olga Atzmon, Gilad Barkan","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a cornerstone of modern question
answering (QA) systems, enabling grounded answers based on external knowledge.
Although recent progress has been driven by open-domain datasets, enterprise QA
systems need datasets that mirror the concrete, domain-specific issues users
raise in day-to-day support scenarios. Critically, evaluating end-to-end RAG
systems requires benchmarks comprising not only question--answer pairs but also
the specific knowledge base (KB) snapshot from which answers were derived. To
address this need, we introduce WixQA, a benchmark suite featuring QA datasets
precisely grounded in the released KB corpus, enabling holistic evaluation of
retrieval and generation components. WixQA includes three distinct QA datasets
derived from Wix.com customer support interactions and grounded in a snapshot
of the public Wix Help Center KB: (i) WixQA-ExpertWritten, 200 real user
queries with expert-authored, multi-step answers; (ii) WixQA-Simulated, 200
expert-validated QA pairs distilled from user dialogues; and (iii)
WixQA-Synthetic, 6,222 LLM-generated QA pairs, with one pair systematically
derived from each article in the knowledge base. We release the KB snapshot
alongside the datasets under MIT license and provide comprehensive baseline
results, forming a unique benchmark for evaluating enterprise RAG systems in
realistic enterprise environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08643v1,,False
Cost Function Estimation Using Inverse Reinforcement Learning with Minimal Observations,13/05/2025,"Sarmad Mehrdad, Avadesh Meduri, Ludovic Righetti","We present an iterative inverse reinforcement learning algorithm to infer
optimal cost functions in continuous spaces. Based on a popular maximum entropy
criteria, our approach iteratively finds a weight improvement step and proposes
a method to find an appropriate step size that ensures learned cost function
features remain similar to the demonstrated trajectory features. In contrast to
similar approaches, our algorithm can individually tune the effectiveness of
each observation for the partition function and does not need a large sample
set, enabling faster learning. We generate sample trajectories by solving an
optimal control problem instead of random sampling, leading to more informative
trajectories. The performance of our method is compared to two state of the art
algorithms to demonstrate its benefits in several simulated environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08619v1,,False
MINIMALIST: switched-capacitor circuits for efficient in-memory computation of gated recurrent units,13/05/2025,"Sebastian Billaudelle, Laura Kriener, Filippo Moro, Tristan Torchet, Melika Payvand","Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have been a long-standing candidate for
processing of temporal sequence data, especially in memory-constrained systems
that one may find in embedded edge computing environments. Recent advances in
training paradigms have now inspired new generations of efficient RNNs. We
introduce a streamlined and hardware-compatible architecture based on minimal
gated recurrent units (GRUs), and an accompanying efficient mixed-signal
hardware implementation of the model. The proposed design leverages
switched-capacitor circuits not only for in-memory computation (IMC), but also
for the gated state updates. The mixed-signal cores rely solely on commodity
circuits consisting of metal capacitors, transmission gates, and a clocked
comparator, thus greatly facilitating scaling and transfer to other technology
nodes.
  We benchmark the performance of our architecture on time series data,
introducing all constraints required for a direct mapping to the hardware
system. The direct compatibility is verified in mixed-signal simulations,
reproducing data recorded from the software-only network model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08599v1,,False
Diffusion-assisted Model Predictive Control Optimization for Power System Real-Time Operation,13/05/2025,"Linna Xu, Yongli Zhu","This paper presents a modified model predictive control (MPC) framework for
real-time power system operation. The framework incorporates a diffusion model
tailored for time series generation to enhance the accuracy of the load
forecasting module used in the system operation. In the absence of explicit
state transition law, a model-identification procedure is leveraged to derive
the system dynamics, thereby eliminating a barrier when applying MPC to a
renewables-dominated power system. Case study results on an industry park
system and the IEEE 30-bus system demonstrate that using the diffusion model to
augment the training dataset significantly improves load-forecasting accuracy,
and the inferred system dynamics are applicable to the real-time grid operation
with solar and wind.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08535v1,,False
The Truth Becomes Clearer Through Debate! Multi-Agent Systems with Large Language Models Unmask Fake News,13/05/2025,"Yuhan Liu, Yuxuan Liu, Xiaoqing Zhang, Xiuying Chen, Rui Yan","In today's digital environment, the rapid propagation of fake news via social
networks poses significant social challenges. Most existing detection methods
either employ traditional classification models, which suffer from low
interpretability and limited generalization capabilities, or craft specific
prompts for large language models (LLMs) to produce explanations and results
directly, failing to leverage LLMs' reasoning abilities fully. Inspired by the
saying that ""truth becomes clearer through debate,"" our study introduces a
novel multi-agent system with LLMs named TruEDebate (TED) to enhance the
interpretability and effectiveness of fake news detection. TED employs a
rigorous debate process inspired by formal debate settings. Central to our
approach are two innovative components: the DebateFlow Agents and the
InsightFlow Agents. The DebateFlow Agents organize agents into two teams, where
one supports and the other challenges the truth of the news. These agents
engage in opening statements, cross-examination, rebuttal, and closing
statements, simulating a rigorous debate process akin to human discourse
analysis, allowing for a thorough evaluation of news content. Concurrently, the
InsightFlow Agents consist of two specialized sub-agents: the Synthesis Agent
and the Analysis Agent. The Synthesis Agent summarizes the debates and provides
an overarching viewpoint, ensuring a coherent and comprehensive evaluation. The
Analysis Agent, which includes a role-aware encoder and a debate graph,
integrates role embeddings and models the interactions between debate roles and
arguments using an attention mechanism, providing the final judgment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08532v1,,False
Distributed Quantum Neural Networks on Distributed Photonic Quantum Computing,13/05/2025,"Kuan-Cheng Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Yu Shang, Felix Burt, Kin K. Leung","We introduce a distributed quantum-classical framework that synergizes
photonic quantum neural networks (QNNs) with matrix-product-state (MPS) mapping
to achieve parameter-efficient training of classical neural networks. By
leveraging universal linear-optical decompositions of $M$-mode interferometers
and photon-counting measurement statistics, our architecture generates neural
parameters through a hybrid quantum-classical workflow: photonic QNNs with
$M(M+1)/2$ trainable parameters produce high-dimensional probability
distributions that are mapped to classical network weights via an MPS model
with bond dimension $\chi$. Empirical validation on MNIST classification
demonstrates that photonic QT achieves an accuracy of $95.50\% \pm 0.84\%$
using 3,292 parameters ($\chi = 10$), compared to $96.89\% \pm 0.31\%$ for
classical baselines with 6,690 parameters. Moreover, a ten-fold compression
ratio is achieved at $\chi = 4$, with a relative accuracy loss of less than
$3\%$. The framework outperforms classical compression techniques (weight
sharing/pruning) by 6--12\% absolute accuracy while eliminating quantum
hardware requirements during inference through classical deployment of
compressed parameters. Simulations incorporating realistic photonic noise
demonstrate the framework's robustness to near-term hardware imperfections.
Ablation studies confirm quantum necessity: replacing photonic QNNs with random
inputs collapses accuracy to chance level ($10.0\% \pm 0.5\%$). Photonic
quantum computing's room-temperature operation, inherent scalability through
spatial-mode multiplexing, and HPC-integrated architecture establish a
practical pathway for distributed quantum machine learning, combining the
expressivity of photonic Hilbert spaces with the deployability of classical
neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08474v1,,False
Learning Treatment Allocations with Risk Control Under Partial Identifiability,13/05/2025,"Sofia Ek, Dave Zachariah","Learning beneficial treatment allocations for a patient population is an
important problem in precision medicine. Many treatments come with adverse side
effects that are not commensurable with their potential benefits. Patients who
do not receive benefits after such treatments are thereby subjected to
unnecessary harm. This is a `treatment risk' that we aim to control when
learning beneficial allocations. The constrained learning problem is challenged
by the fact that the treatment risk is not in general identifiable using either
randomized trial or observational data. We propose a certifiable learning
method that controls the treatment risk with finite samples in the partially
identified setting. The method is illustrated using both simulated and real
data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08378v1,,False
Modeling Unseen Environments with Language-guided Composable Causal Components in Reinforcement Learning,13/05/2025,"Xinyue Wang, Biwei Huang","Generalization in reinforcement learning (RL) remains a significant
challenge, especially when agents encounter novel environments with unseen
dynamics. Drawing inspiration from human compositional reasoning -- where known
components are reconfigured to handle new situations -- we introduce World
Modeling with Compositional Causal Components (WM3C). This novel framework
enhances RL generalization by learning and leveraging compositional causal
components. Unlike previous approaches focusing on invariant representation
learning or meta-learning, WM3C identifies and utilizes causal dynamics among
composable elements, facilitating robust adaptation to new tasks. Our approach
integrates language as a compositional modality to decompose the latent space
into meaningful components and provides theoretical guarantees for their unique
identification under mild assumptions. Our practical implementation uses a
masked autoencoder with mutual information constraints and adaptive sparsity
regularization to capture high-level semantic information and effectively
disentangle transition dynamics. Experiments on numerical simulations and
real-world robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that WM3C significantly
outperforms existing methods in identifying latent processes, improving policy
learning, and generalizing to unseen tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08361v1,,False
STORYANCHORS: Generating Consistent Multi-Scene Story Frames for Long-Form Narratives,13/05/2025,"Bo Wang, Haoyang Huang, Zhiyin Lu, Fengyuan Liu, Guoqing Ma, Jianlong Yuan, Yuan Zhang, Nan Duan","This paper introduces StoryAnchors, a unified framework for generating
high-quality, multi-scene story frames with strong temporal consistency. The
framework employs a bidirectional story generator that integrates both past and
future contexts to ensure temporal consistency, character continuity, and
smooth scene transitions throughout the narrative. Specific conditions are
introduced to distinguish story frame generation from standard video synthesis,
facilitating greater scene diversity and enhancing narrative richness. To
further improve generation quality, StoryAnchors integrates Multi-Event Story
Frame Labeling and Progressive Story Frame Training, enabling the model to
capture both overarching narrative flow and event-level dynamics. This approach
supports the creation of editable and expandable story frames, allowing for
manual modifications and the generation of longer, more complex sequences.
Extensive experiments show that StoryAnchors outperforms existing open-source
models in key areas such as consistency, narrative coherence, and scene
diversity. Its performance in narrative consistency and story richness is also
on par with GPT-4o. Ultimately, StoryAnchors pushes the boundaries of
story-driven frame generation, offering a scalable, flexible, and highly
editable foundation for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08350v1,,False
Low-Complexity Inference in Continual Learning via Compressed Knowledge Transfer,13/05/2025,"Zhenrong Liu, Janne M. J. Huttunen, Mikko Honkala","Continual learning (CL) aims to train models that can learn a sequence of
tasks without forgetting previously acquired knowledge. A core challenge in CL
is balancing stability -- preserving performance on old tasks -- and plasticity
-- adapting to new ones. Recently, large pre-trained models have been widely
adopted in CL for their ability to support both, offering strong generalization
for new tasks and resilience against forgetting. However, their high
computational cost at inference time limits their practicality in real-world
applications, especially those requiring low latency or energy efficiency. To
address this issue, we explore model compression techniques, including pruning
and knowledge distillation (KD), and propose two efficient frameworks tailored
for class-incremental learning (CIL), a challenging CL setting where task
identities are unavailable during inference. The pruning-based framework
includes pre- and post-pruning strategies that apply compression at different
training stages. The KD-based framework adopts a teacher-student architecture,
where a large pre-trained teacher transfers downstream-relevant knowledge to a
compact student. Extensive experiments on multiple CIL benchmarks demonstrate
that the proposed frameworks achieve a better trade-off between accuracy and
inference complexity, consistently outperforming strong baselines. We further
analyze the trade-offs between the two frameworks in terms of accuracy and
efficiency, offering insights into their use across different scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08327v1,,False
Efficient Unstructured Pruning of Mamba State-Space Models for Resource-Constrained Environments,13/05/2025,"Ibne Farabi Shihab, Sanjeda Akter, Anuj Sharma","State-space models (SSMs), particularly the Mamba architecture, have emerged
as powerful alternatives to Transformers for sequence modeling, offering
linear-time complexity and competitive performance across diverse tasks.
However, their large parameter counts pose significant challenges for
deployment in resource-constrained environments. We propose a novel
unstructured pruning framework tailored for Mamba models that achieves up to
70\% parameter reduction while retaining over 95\% of the original performance.
Our approach integrates three key innovations: (1) a gradient-aware magnitude
pruning technique that combines weight magnitude and gradient information to
identify less critical parameters, (2) an iterative pruning schedule that
gradually increases sparsity to maintain model stability, and (3) a global
pruning strategy that optimizes parameter allocation across the entire model.
Through extensive experiments on WikiText-103, Long Range Arena, and ETT
time-series benchmarks, we demonstrate significant efficiency gains with
minimal performance degradation. Our analysis of pruning effects on Mamba's
components reveals critical insights into the architecture's redundancy and
robustness, enabling practical deployment in resource-constrained settings

M3G: Multi-Granular Gesture Generator for Audio-Driven Full-Body Human Motion Synthesis,13/05/2025,"Zhizhuo Yin, Yuk Hang Tsui, Pan Hui","Generating full-body human gestures encompassing face, body, hands, and
global movements from audio is a valuable yet challenging task in virtual
avatar creation. Previous systems focused on tokenizing the human gestures
framewisely and predicting the tokens of each frame from the input audio.
However, one observation is that the number of frames required for a complete
expressive human gesture, defined as granularity, varies among different human
gesture patterns. Existing systems fail to model these gesture patterns due to
the fixed granularity of their gesture tokens. To solve this problem, we
propose a novel framework named Multi-Granular Gesture Generator (M3G) for
audio-driven holistic gesture generation. In M3G, we propose a novel
Multi-Granular VQ-VAE (MGVQ-VAE) to tokenize motion patterns and reconstruct
motion sequences from different temporal granularities. Subsequently, we
proposed a multi-granular token predictor that extracts multi-granular
information from audio and predicts the corresponding motion tokens. Then M3G
reconstructs the human gestures from the predicted tokens using the MGVQ-VAE.
Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our proposed M3G
framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of generating
natural and expressive full-body human gestures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08293v1,,False
Automatic Curriculum Learning for Driving Scenarios: Towards Robust and Efficient Reinforcement Learning,13/05/2025,"Ahmed Abouelazm, Tim Weinstein, Tim Joseph, Philip Schörner, J. Marius Zöllner","This paper addresses the challenges of training end-to-end autonomous driving
agents using Reinforcement Learning (RL). RL agents are typically trained in a
fixed set of scenarios and nominal behavior of surrounding road users in
simulations, limiting their generalization and real-life deployment. While
domain randomization offers a potential solution by randomly sampling driving
scenarios, it frequently results in inefficient training and sub-optimal
policies due to the high variance among training scenarios. To address these
limitations, we propose an automatic curriculum learning framework that
dynamically generates driving scenarios with adaptive complexity based on the
agent's evolving capabilities. Unlike manually designed curricula that
introduce expert bias and lack scalability, our framework incorporates a
``teacher'' that automatically generates and mutates driving scenarios based on
their learning potential -- an agent-centric metric derived from the agent's
current policy -- eliminating the need for expert design. The framework
enhances training efficiency by excluding scenarios the agent has mastered or
finds too challenging. We evaluate our framework in a reinforcement learning
setting where the agent learns a driving policy from camera images. Comparative
results against baseline methods, including fixed scenario training and domain
randomization, demonstrate that our approach leads to enhanced generalization,
achieving higher success rates: +9\% in low traffic density, +21\% in high
traffic density, and faster convergence with fewer training steps. Our findings
highlight the potential of ACL in improving the robustness and efficiency of
RL-based autonomous driving agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08264v1,,False
Object detection in adverse weather conditions for autonomous vehicles using Instruct Pix2Pix,13/05/2025,"Unai Gurbindo, Axel Brando, Jaume Abella, Caroline König","Enhancing the robustness of object detection systems under adverse weather

An Effective Flow-based Method for Positive-Unlabeled Learning: 2-HNC,13/05/2025,"Dorit Hochbaum, Torpong Nitayanont","In many scenarios of binary classification, only positive instances are
provided in the training data, leaving the rest of the data unlabeled. This
setup, known as positive-unlabeled (PU) learning, is addressed here with a
network flow-based method which utilizes pairwise similarities between samples.
The method we propose here, 2-HNC, leverages Hochbaum's Normalized Cut (HNC)
and the set of solutions it provides by solving a parametric minimum cut
problem. The set of solutions, that are nested partitions of the samples into
two sets, correspond to varying tradeoff values between the two goals: high
intra-similarity inside the sets and low inter-similarity between the two sets.
This nested sequence is utilized here to deliver a ranking of unlabeled samples
by their likelihood of being negative. Building on this insight, our method,
2-HNC, proceeds in two stages. The first stage generates this ranking without
assuming any negative labels, using a problem formulation that is constrained
only on positive labeled samples. The second stage augments the positive set
with likely-negative samples and recomputes the classification. The final label
prediction selects among all generated partitions in both stages, the one that
delivers a positive class proportion, closest to a prior estimate of this
quantity, which is assumed to be given. Extensive experiments across synthetic
and real datasets show that 2-HNC yields strong performance and often surpasses
existing state-of-the-art algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.08212v1,,False
A Multi-scale Representation Learning Framework for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting,13/05/2025,"Boshi Gao, Qingjian Ni, Fanbo Ju, Yu Chen, Ziqi Zhao","Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) offers broad utility in practical
settings like energy consumption and weather prediction. Accurately predicting
long-term changes, however, is demanding due to the intricate temporal patterns
and inherent multi-scale variations within time series. This work confronts key
issues in LTSF, including the suboptimal use of multi-granularity information,
the neglect of channel-specific attributes, and the unique nature of trend and
seasonal components, by introducing a proficient MLP-based forecasting
framework. Our method adeptly disentangles complex temporal dynamics using
clear, concurrent predictions across various scales. These multi-scale
forecasts are then skillfully integrated through a system that dynamically
assigns importance to information from different granularities, sensitive to
individual channel characteristics. To manage the specific features of temporal
patterns, a two-pronged structure is utilized to model trend and seasonal
elements independently. Experimental results on eight LTSF benchmarks

Foundation Models Knowledge Distillation For Battery Capacity Degradation Forecast,13/05/2025,"Joey Chan, Zhen Chen, Ershun Pan","Accurate estimation of lithium-ion battery capacity degradation is critical
for enhancing the reliability and safety of battery operations. Traditional
expert models, tailored to specific scenarios, provide isolated estimations.
With the rapid advancement of data-driven techniques, a series of
general-purpose time-series foundation models have been developed. However,
foundation models specifically designed for battery capacity degradation remain

prediction using large model technology, this study proposes a
degradation-aware fine-tuning strategy for time-series foundation models. We
apply this strategy to fine-tune the Timer model on approximately 10 GB of
open-source battery charge discharge data. Validation on our released

possesses strong zero-shot generalization capability in capacity degradation
forecasting. To address the computational challenges of deploying large models,
