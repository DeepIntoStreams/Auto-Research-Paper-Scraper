Real-Time Anomaly Detection and Reactive Planning with Large Language Models,11/07/2024,"Rohan Sinha, Amine Elhafsi, Christopher Agia, Matthew Foutter, Edward Schmerling, Marco Pavone","Foundation models, e.g., large language models (LLMs), trained on
internet-scale data possess zero-shot generalization capabilities that make
them a promising technology towards detecting and mitigating
out-of-distribution failure modes of robotic systems. Fully realizing this
promise, however, poses two challenges: (i) mitigating the considerable
computational expense of these models such that they may be applied online, and
(ii) incorporating their judgement regarding potential anomalies into a safe
control framework. In this work, we present a two-stage reasoning framework:
First is a fast binary anomaly classifier that analyzes observations in an LLM
embedding space, which may then trigger a slower fallback selection stage that
utilizes the reasoning capabilities of generative LLMs. These stages correspond
to branch points in a model predictive control strategy that maintains the
joint feasibility of continuing along various fallback plans to account for the
slow reasoner's latency as soon as an anomaly is detected, thus ensuring
safety. We show that our fast anomaly classifier outperforms autoregressive
reasoning with state-of-the-art GPT models, even when instantiated with
relatively small language models. This enables our runtime monitor to improve
the trustworthiness of dynamic robotic systems, such as quadrotors or
autonomous vehicles, under resource and time constraints. Videos illustrating
our approach in both simulation and real-world experiments are available on

MetaUrban: A Simulation Platform for Embodied AI in Urban Spaces,11/07/2024,"Wayne Wu, Honglin He, Yiran Wang, Chenda Duan, Jack He, Zhizheng Liu, Quanyi Li, Bolei Zhou","Public urban spaces like streetscapes and plazas serve residents and
accommodate social life in all its vibrant variations. Recent advances in
Robotics and Embodied AI make public urban spaces no longer exclusive to
humans. Food delivery bots and electric wheelchairs have started sharing
sidewalks with pedestrians, while diverse robot dogs and humanoids have
recently emerged in the street. Ensuring the generalizability and safety of
these forthcoming mobile machines is crucial when navigating through the
bustling streets in urban spaces. In this work, we present MetaUrban, a
compositional simulation platform for Embodied AI research in urban spaces.
MetaUrban can construct an infinite number of interactive urban scenes from
compositional elements, covering a vast array of ground plans, object
placements, pedestrians, vulnerable road users, and other mobile agents'
appearances and dynamics. We design point navigation and social navigation
tasks as the pilot study using MetaUrban for embodied AI research and establish
various baselines of Reinforcement Learning and Imitation Learning. Experiments
demonstrate that the compositional nature of the simulated environments can
substantially improve the generalizability and safety of the trained mobile
agents. MetaUrban will be made publicly available to provide more research
opportunities and foster safe and trustworthy embodied AI in urban spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08725v1,,False
Sensor-Aware Classifiers for Energy-Efficient Time Series Applications on IoT Devices,11/07/2024,"Dina Hussein, Lubah Nelson, Ganapati Bhat","Time-series data processing is an important component of many real-world
applications, such as health monitoring, environmental monitoring, and digital
agriculture. These applications collect distinct windows of sensor data (e.g.,
few seconds) and process them to assess the environment. Machine learning (ML)
models are being employed in time-series applications due to their
generalization abilities for classification. State-of-the-art time-series
applications wait for entire sensor data window to become available before
processing the data using ML algorithms, resulting in high sensor energy
consumption. However, not all situations require processing full sensor window
to make accurate inference. For instance, in activity recognition, sitting and
standing activities can be inferred with partial windows. Using this insight,
we propose to employ early exit classifiers with partial sensor windows to
minimize energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we first
utilize multiple early exits with successively increasing amount of data as
they become available in a window. If early exits provide inference with high
confidence, we return the label and enter low power mode for sensors. The
proposed approach has potential to enable significant energy savings in time
series applications. We utilize neural networks and random forest classifiers
to evaluate our approach. Our evaluations with six datasets show that the
proposed approach enables up to 50-60% energy savings on average without any
impact on accuracy. The energy savings can enable time-series applications in
remote locations with limited energy availability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08715v1,,False
Estimation of spatio-temporal extremes via generative neural networks,11/07/2024,"Christopher BÃ¼lte, Lisa Leimenstoll, Melanie Schienle","Recent methods in modeling spatial extreme events have focused on utilizing
parametric max-stable processes and their underlying dependence structure. In
this work, we provide a unified approach for analyzing spatial extremes with
little available data by estimating the distribution of model parameters or the
spatial dependence directly. By employing recent developments in generative
neural networks we predict a full sample-based distribution, allowing for
direct assessment of uncertainty regarding model parameters or other parameter
dependent functionals. We validate our method by fitting several simulated
max-stable processes, showing a high accuracy of the approach, regarding
parameter estimation, as well as uncertainty quantification. Additional
robustness checks highlight the generalization and extrapolation capabilities
of the model, while an application to precipitation extremes across Western
Germany demonstrates the usability of our approach in real-world scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08668v1,,False
Latent Conditional Diffusion-based Data Augmentation for Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph Mode,11/07/2024,"Yuxing Tian, Yiyan Qi, Aiwen Jiang, Qi Huang, Jian Guo","Continuous-Time Dynamic Graph (CTDG) precisely models evolving real-world
relationships, drawing heightened interest in dynamic graph learning across
academia and industry. However, existing CTDG models encounter challenges
stemming from noise and limited historical data. Graph Data Augmentation (GDA)
emerges as a critical solution, yet current approaches primarily focus on
static graphs and struggle to effectively address the dynamics inherent in
CTDGs. Moreover, these methods often demand substantial domain expertise for
parameter tuning and lack theoretical guarantees for augmentation efficacy. To
address these issues, we propose Conda, a novel latent diffusion-based GDA
method tailored for CTDGs. Conda features a sandwich-like architecture,
incorporating a Variational Auto-Encoder (VAE) and a conditional diffusion
model, aimed at generating enhanced historical neighbor embeddings for target
nodes. Unlike conventional diffusion models trained on entire graphs via
pre-training, Conda requires historical neighbor sequence embeddings of target
nodes for training, thus facilitating more targeted augmentation. We integrate
Conda into the CTDG model and adopt an alternating training strategy to
optimize performance. Extensive experimentation across six widely used
real-world datasets showcases the consistent performance improvement of our
approach, particularly in scenarios with limited historical data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08500v1,,False
Joint Optimization of Age of Information and Energy Consumption in NR-V2X System based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,11/07/2024,"Shulin Song, Zheng Zhang, Qiong Wu, Qiang Fan, Pingyi Fan","Autonomous driving may be the most important application scenario of next
generation, the development of wireless access technologies enabling reliable
and low-latency vehicle communication becomes crucial. To address this, 3GPP
has developed Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) specifications based on 5G New Radio
(NR) technology, where Mode 2 Side-Link (SL) communication resembles Mode 4 in
LTE-V2X, allowing direct communication between vehicles. This supplements SL
communication in LTE-V2X and represents the latest advancement in cellular V2X
(C-V2X) with improved performance of NR-V2X. However, in NR-V2X Mode 2,
resource collisions still occur, and thus degrade the age of information (AOI).
Therefore, a interference cancellation method is employed to mitigate this
impact by combining NR-V2X with Non-Orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
technology. In NR-V2X, when vehicles select smaller resource reservation
interval (RRI), higher-frequency transmissions take ore energy to reduce AoI.
Hence, it is important to jointly consider AoI and communication energy
consumption based on NR-V2X communication. Then, we formulate such an
optimization problem and employ the Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm
to compute the optimal transmission RRI and transmission power for each
transmitting vehicle to reduce the energy consumption of each transmitting
vehicle and the AoI of each receiving vehicle. Extensive simulations have
demonstrated the performance of our proposed algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08458v1,,False
"A Comprehensive Survey on Human Video Generation: Challenges, Methods, and Insights",11/07/2024,"Wentao Lei, Jinting Wang, Fengji Ma, Guanjie Huang, Li Liu","Human video generation is a dynamic and rapidly evolving task that aims to
synthesize 2D human body video sequences with generative models given control
conditions such as text, audio, and pose. With the potential for wide-ranging
applications in film, gaming, and virtual communication, the ability to
generate natural and realistic human video is critical. Recent advancements in
generative models have laid a solid foundation for the growing interest in this
area. Despite the significant progress, the task of human video generation
remains challenging due to the consistency of characters, the complexity of
human motion, and difficulties in their relationship with the environment. This
survey provides a comprehensive review of the current state of human video
generation, marking, to the best of our knowledge, the first extensive
literature review in this domain. We start with an introduction to the
fundamentals of human video generation and the evolution of generative models
that have facilitated the field's growth. We then examine the main methods
employed for three key sub-tasks within human video generation: text-driven,
audio-driven, and pose-driven motion generation. These areas are explored
concerning the conditions that guide the generation process. Furthermore, we
offer a collection of the most commonly utilized datasets and the evaluation
metrics that are crucial in assessing the quality and realism of generated
videos. The survey concludes with a discussion of the current challenges in the
field and suggests possible directions for future research. The goal of this
survey is to offer the research community a clear and holistic view of the
advancements in human video generation, highlighting the milestones achieved

Parallelizing Autoregressive Generation with Variational State Space Models,11/07/2024,"Gaspard Lambrechts, Yann Claes, Pierre Geurts, Damien Ernst","Attention-based models such as Transformers and recurrent models like state
space models (SSMs) have emerged as successful methods for autoregressive
sequence modeling. Although both enable parallel training, none enable parallel
generation due to their autoregressiveness. We propose the variational SSM
(VSSM), a variational autoencoder (VAE) where both the encoder and decoder are
SSMs. Since sampling the latent variables and decoding them with the SSM can be
parallelized, both training and generation can be conducted in parallel.
Moreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without
reprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM
that can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common
in language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still
enables parallel generation. We highlight on toy problems (MNIST, CIFAR) the
empirical gains in speed-up and show that it competes with traditional models
in terms of generation quality (Transformer, Mamba SSM).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08415v1,,False
Digital twins to alleviate the need for real field data in vision-based vehicle speed detection systems,11/07/2024,"Antonio HernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­nez, IvÃ¡n GarcÃ­a Daza, Carlos FernÃ¡ndez LÃ³pez, David FernÃ¡ndez Llorca","Accurate vision-based speed estimation is much more cost-effective than
traditional methods based on radar or LiDAR. However, it is also challenging
due to the limitations of perspective projection on a discrete sensor, as well
as the high sensitivity to calibration, lighting and weather conditions.
Interestingly, deep learning approaches (which dominate the field of computer
vision) are very limited in this context due to the lack of available data.
Indeed, obtaining video sequences of real road traffic with accurate speed
values associated with each vehicle is very complex and costly, and the number
of available datasets is very limited. Recently, some approaches are focusing
on the use of synthetic data. However, it is still unclear how models trained
on synthetic data can be effectively applied to real world conditions. In this
work, we propose the use of digital-twins using CARLA simulator to generate a
large dataset representative of a specific real-world camera. The synthetic
dataset contains a large variability of vehicle types, colours, speeds,
lighting and weather conditions. A 3D CNN model is trained on the digital twin
and tested on the real sequences. Unlike previous approaches that generate
multi-camera sequences, we found that the gap between the the real and the
virtual conditions is a key factor in obtaining low speed estimation errors.
Even with a preliminary approach, the mean absolute error obtained remains
below 3km/h.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08380v1,,False
Continually Learn to Map Visual Concepts to Large Language Models in Resource-constrained Environments,11/07/2024,"Clea Rebillard, Julio Hurtado, Andrii Krutsylo, Lucia Passaro, Vincenzo Lomonaco","Learning continually from a stream of non-i.i.d. data is an open challenge in
deep learning, even more so when working in resource-constrained environments
such as embedded devices. Visual models that are continually updated through
supervised learning are often prone to overfitting, catastrophic forgetting,
and biased representations. On the other hand, large language models contain
knowledge about multiple concepts and their relations, which can foster a more
robust, informed and coherent learning process. This work proposes Continual
Visual Mapping (CVM), an approach that continually ground vision
representations to a knowledge space extracted from a fixed Language model.
Specifically, CVM continually trains a small and efficient visual model to map
its representations into a conceptual space established by a fixed Large
Language Model. Due to their smaller nature, CVM can be used when directly
adapting large visual pre-trained models is unfeasible due to computational or
data constraints. CVM overcome state-of-the-art continual learning methods on
five benchmarks and offers a promising avenue for addressing generalization
capabilities in continual learning, even in computationally constrained
devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08279v1,,False
Synthetic Electroretinogram Signal Generation Using Conditional Generative Adversarial Network for Enhancing Classification of Autism Spectrum Disorder,11/07/2024,"Mikhail Kulyabin, Paul A. Constable, Aleksei Zhdanov, Irene O. Lee, David H. Skuse, Dorothy A. Thompson, Andreas Maier","The electroretinogram (ERG) is a clinical test that records the retina's
electrical response to light. The ERG is a promising way to study different
neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, including autism spectrum
disorder (ASD) - a neurodevelopmental condition that impacts language,
communication, and reciprocal social interactions. However, in heterogeneous
populations, such as ASD, where the ability to collect large datasets is
limited, the application of artificial intelligence (AI) is complicated.
Synthetic ERG signals generated from real ERG recordings carry similar
information as natural ERGs and, therefore, could be used as an extension for
natural data to increase datasets so that AI applications can be fully
utilized. As proof of principle, this study presents a Generative Adversarial
Network capable of generating synthetic ERG signals of children with ASD and
typically developing control individuals. We applied a Time Series Transformer

classification results on the extended synthetic signals dataset. This approach
may support classification models in related psychiatric conditions where the

How Well Can a Long Sequence Model Model Long Sequences? Comparing Architechtural Inductive Biases on Long-Context Abilities,11/07/2024,Jerry Huang,"Long sequences occur in abundance within real-world scenarios, hence properly
modelling them opens numerous down-stream use-cases. Deep neural networks,
however, have often struggled with these for a variety of reasons. Recent
advances, both in system engineering as well as model design, have enabled the
scaling up of model that are purported to support extended context length. In
particular, the state-space and linear recurrent neural network families of
models hypothetically can entend to infinite sequence lenth. However, is this
too good to be true? We conduct an evaluation to show that while such claims
may be sound theoretically, there remain large practical gaps that are
empirically observed. In particular, recurrent models still suffer in the same
settings as long-context LLMs with attention. We further show that different
inductive biases have inconsistent extrapolation capabilities, highlighting the
need to further study such paradigms and investigate why long-context models
seemingly fail to behave as one might expect.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08112v1,,False
Towards Interpretable Foundation Models of Robot Behavior: A Task Specific Policy Generation Approach,10/07/2024,"Isaac Sheidlower, Reuben Aronson, Elaine Schaertl Short","Foundation models are a promising path toward general-purpose and
user-friendly robots. The prevalent approach involves training a generalist
policy that, like a reinforcement learning policy, uses observations to output
actions. Although this approach has seen much success, several concerns arise
when considering deployment and end-user interaction with these systems. In
particular, the lack of modularity between tasks means that when model weights
are updated (e.g., when a user provides feedback), the behavior in other,
unrelated tasks may be affected. This can negatively impact the system's
interpretability and usability. We present an alternative approach to the
design of robot foundation models, Diffusion for Policy Parameters (DPP), which
generates stand-alone, task-specific policies. Since these policies are
detached from the foundation model, they are updated only when a user wants,
either through feedback or personalization, allowing them to gain a high degree
of familiarity with that policy. We demonstrate a proof-of-concept of DPP in
simulation then discuss its limitations and the future of interpretable
foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08065v1,,False
A New Self-organizing Interval Type-2 Fuzzy Neural Network for Multi-Step Time Series Prediction,10/07/2024,"Fulong Yao, Wanqing Zhao, Matthew Forshaw, Yang Song","This paper proposes a new self-organizing interval type-2 fuzzy neural
network with multiple outputs (SOIT2FNN-MO) for multi-step time series
prediction. Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer
network is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and
model interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified
consequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model
for multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to
address the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by
highdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal
connections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage
self-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy
rules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and
perform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all
network parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and
microgrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our
approach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model
interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08010v1,,False
Automating Weak Label Generation for Data Programming with Clinicians in the Loop,10/07/2024,"Jean Park, Sydney Pugh, Kaustubh Sridhar, Mengyu Liu, Navish Yarna, Ramneet Kaur, Souradeep Dutta, Elena Bernardis, Oleg Sokolsky, Insup Lee","Large Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are often data hungry and need high-quality
labeled data in copious amounts for learning to converge. This is a challenge
in the field of medicine since high quality labeled data is often scarce. Data
programming has been the ray of hope in this regard, since it allows us to
label unlabeled data using multiple weak labeling functions. Such functions are
often supplied by a domain expert. Data-programming can combine multiple weak
labeling functions and suggest labels better than simple majority voting over
the different functions. However, it is not straightforward to express such
weak labeling functions, especially in high-dimensional settings such as images
and time-series data. What we propose in this paper is a way to bypass this
issue, using distance functions. In high-dimensional spaces, it is easier to
find meaningful distance metrics which can generalize across different labeling
tasks. We propose an algorithm that queries an expert for labels of a few
representative samples of the dataset. These samples are carefully chosen by
the algorithm to capture the distribution of the dataset. The labels assigned
by the expert on the representative subset induce a labeling on the full
dataset, thereby generating weak labels to be used in the data programming
pipeline. In our medical time series case study, labeling a subset of 50 to 130
out of 3,265 samples showed 17-28% improvement in accuracy and 13-28%
improvement in F1 over the baseline using clinician-defined labeling functions.
In our medical image case study, labeling a subset of about 50 to 120 images
from 6,293 unlabeled medical images using our approach showed significant

as targets on RGB images. These images are fed into a controller that maps the
visual targets into a sequence of joint-positions. We study GENIMA on 25
RLBench and 9 real-world manipulation tasks. We find that, by lifting actions
into image-space, internet pre-trained diffusion models can generate policies
that outperform state-of-the-art visuomotor approaches, especially in
robustness to scene perturbations and generalizing to novel objects. Our method

autonomous driving simulations. The surge of generative AI facilitates
designing city layouts based on deep learning models. However, the lack of

Towards Human-Like Driving: Active Inference in Autonomous Vehicle Control,10/07/2024,"Elahe Delavari, John Moore, Junho Hong, Jaerock Kwon","This paper presents a novel approach to Autonomous Vehicle (AV) control
through the application of active inference, a theory derived from neuroscience
that conceptualizes the brain as a predictive machine. Traditional autonomous
driving systems rely heavily on Modular Pipelines, Imitation Learning, or
Reinforcement Learning, each with inherent limitations in adaptability,

perform lane following maneuvers within a simulated urban environment. We
demonstrate that our model, despite its simplicity, effectively learns and
generalizes from limited data without extensive retraining, significantly
reducing computational demands. The proposed approach not only enhances the
adaptability and performance of AVs in dynamic scenarios but also aligns
closely with human-like driving behavior, leveraging a generative model to

Feasibility Study on Active Learning of Smart Surrogates for Scientific Simulations,10/07/2024,"Pradeep Bajracharya, Javier QuetzalcÃ³atl Toledo-MarÃ­n, Geoffrey Fox, Shantenu Jha, Linwei Wang","High-performance scientific simulations, important for comprehension of

"Physics-Informed Geometric Operators to Support Surrogate, Dimension Reduction and Generative Models for Engineering Design",10/07/2024,"Shahroz Khan, Zahid Masood, Muhammad Usama, Konstantinos Kostas, Panagiotis Kaklis, Wei, Chen","In this work, we propose a set of physics-informed geometric operators (GOs)
to enrich the geometric data provided for training surrogate/discriminative
models, dimension reduction, and generative models, typically employed for
performance prediction, dimension reduction, and creating data-driven
parameterisations, respectively. However, as both the input and output streams
of these models consist of low-level shape representations, they often fail to
capture shape characteristics essential for performance analyses. Therefore,
the proposed GOs exploit the differential and integral properties of
shapes--accessed through Fourier descriptors, curvature integrals, geometric
moments, and their invariants--to infuse high-level intrinsic geometric
information and physics into the feature vector used for training, even when
employing simple model architectures or low-level parametric descriptions. We
showed that for surrogate modelling, along with the inclusion of the notion of
physics, GOs enact regularisation to reduce over-fitting and enhance
generalisation to new, unseen designs. Furthermore, through extensive
experimentation, we demonstrate that for dimension reduction and generative
models, incorporating the proposed GOs enriches the training data with compact
global and local geometric features. This significantly enhances the quality of
the resulting latent space, thereby facilitating the generation of valid and
diverse designs. Lastly, we also show that GOs can enable learning parametric
sensitivities to a great extent. Consequently, these enhancements accelerate
the convergence rate of shape optimisers towards optimal solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07611v1,,False
Secondary Structure-Guided Novel Protein Sequence Generation with Latent Graph Diffusion,10/07/2024,"Yutong Hu, Yang Tan, Andi Han, Lirong Zheng, Liang Hong, Bingxin Zhou","The advent of deep learning has introduced efficient approaches for de novo

Token-Mol 1.0: Tokenized drug design with large language model,10/07/2024,"Jike Wang, Rui Qin, Mingyang Wang, Meijing Fang, Yangyang Zhang, Yuchen Zhu, Qun Su, Qiaolin Gou, Chao Shen, Odin Zhang, Zhenxing Wu, Dejun Jiang, Xujun Zhang, Huifeng Zhao, Xiaozhe Wan, Zhourui Wu, Liwei Liu, Yu Kang, Chang-Yu Hsieh, Tingjun Hou","Significant interests have recently risen in leveraging sequence-based large
language models (LLMs) for drug design. However, most current applications of
LLMs in drug discovery lack the ability to comprehend three-dimensional (3D)
structures, thereby limiting their effectiveness in tasks that explicitly
involve molecular conformations. In this study, we introduced Token-Mol, a
token-only 3D drug design model. This model encodes all molecular information,
including 2D and 3D structures, as well as molecular property data, into
tokens, which transforms classification and regression tasks in drug discovery
into probabilistic prediction problems, thereby enabling learning through a
unified paradigm. Token-Mol is built on the transformer decoder architecture
and trained using random causal masking techniques. Additionally, we proposed
the Gaussian cross-entropy (GCE) loss function to overcome the challenges in
regression tasks, significantly enhancing the capacity of LLMs to learn
continuous numerical values. Through a combination of fine-tuning and
reinforcement learning (RL), Token-Mol achieves performance comparable to or
surpassing existing task-specific methods across various downstream tasks,
including pocket-based molecular generation, conformation generation, and
molecular property prediction. Compared to existing molecular pre-trained
models, Token-Mol exhibits superior proficiency in handling a wider range of
downstream tasks essential for drug design. Notably, our approach improves
regression task accuracy by approximately 30% compared to similar token-only
methods. Token-Mol overcomes the precision limitations of token-only models and
has the potential to integrate seamlessly with general models such as ChatGPT,
paving the way for the development of a universal artificial intelligence drug
design model that facilitates rapid and high-quality drug design by experts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07930v1,,False
Flow to Rare Events: An Application of Normalizing Flow in Temporal Importance Sampling for Automated Vehicle Validation,10/07/2024,"Yichun Ye, He Zhang, Ye Tian, Jian Sun","Automated Vehicle (AV) validation based on simulated testing requires
unbiased evaluation and high efficiency. One effective solution is to increase
the exposure to risky rare events while reweighting the probability measure.
However, characterizing the distribution of risky events is particularly
challenging due to the paucity of samples and the temporality of continuous
scenario variables. To solve it, we devise a method to represent, generate, and
reweight the distribution of risky rare events. We decompose the temporal
evolution of continuous variables into distribution components based on
conditional probability. By introducing the Risk Indicator Function, the
distribution of risky rare events is theoretically precipitated out of
naturalistic driving distribution. This targeted distribution is practically
generated via Normalizing Flow, which achieves exact and tractable probability
evaluation of intricate distribution. The rare event distribution is then
demonstrated as the advantageous Importance Sampling distribution. We also
promote the technique of temporal Importance Sampling. The combined method,
named as TrimFlow, is executed to estimate the collision rate of Car-following
scenarios as a tentative practice. The results showed that sampling background
vehicle maneuvers from rare event distribution could evolve testing scenarios
to hazardous states. TrimFlow reduced 86.1% of tests compared to generating
testing scenarios according to their exposure in the naturalistic driving
environment. In addition, the TrimFlow method is not limited to one specific
type of functional scenario.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07320v1,,False
ViTime: A Visual Intelligence-Based Foundation Model for Time Series Forecasting,10/07/2024,"Luoxiao Yang, Yun Wang, Xinqi Fan, Israel Cohen, Yue Zhao, Zijun Zhang","The success of large pretrained models in natural language processing (NLP)
and computer vision (CV) has opened new avenues for constructing foundation
models for time series forecasting (TSF). Traditional TSF foundation models
rely heavily on numerical data fitting. In contrast, the human brain is
inherently skilled at processing visual information, prefer predicting future
trends by observing visualized sequences. From a biomimetic perspective,
utilizing models to directly process numerical sequences might not be the most
effective route to achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). This paper
proposes ViTime, a novel Visual Intelligence-based foundation model for TSF.
ViTime overcomes the limitations of numerical time series data fitting by
utilizing visual data processing paradigms and employs a innovative data
synthesis method during training, called Real Time Series (RealTS). Experiments
on a diverse set of previously unseen forecasting datasets demonstrate that
ViTime achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot performance, even surpassing the
best individually trained supervised models in some situations. These findings
suggest that visual intelligence can significantly enhance time series analysis
and forecasting, paving the way for more advanced and versatile models in the
field. The code for our framework is accessible at

Causal Discovery in Semi-Stationary Time Series,10/07/2024,"Shanyun Gao, Raghavendra Addanki, Tong Yu, Ryan A. Rossi, Murat Kocaoglu","Discovering causal relations from observational time series without making
the stationary assumption is a significant challenge. In practice, this
challenge is common in many areas, such as retail sales, transportation
systems, and medical science. Here, we consider this problem for a class of
non-stationary time series. The structural causal model (SCM) of this type of
time series, called the semi-stationary time series, exhibits that a finite
number of different causal mechanisms occur sequentially and periodically
across time. This model holds considerable practical utility because it can
represent periodicity, including common occurrences such as seasonality and
diurnal variation. We propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm for
discovering causal relations in this setting. The resulting algorithm,
PCMCI$_{\Omega}$, can capture the alternating and recurring changes in the
causal mechanisms and then identify the underlying causal graph with
conditional independence (CI) tests. We show that this algorithm is sound in
identifying causal relations on discrete time series. We validate the algorithm
with extensive experiments on continuous and discrete simulated data. We also
apply our algorithm to a real-world climate dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07291v1,,False
Causal Discovery-Driven Change Point Detection in Time Series,10/07/2024,"Shanyun Gao, Raghavendra Addanki, Tong Yu, Ryan A. Rossi, Murat Kocaoglu","Change point detection in time series seeks to identify times when the
probability distribution of time series changes. It is widely applied in many
areas, such as human-activity sensing and medical science. In the context of
multivariate time series, this typically involves examining the joint
distribution of high-dimensional data: If any one variable changes, the whole
time series is assumed to have changed. However, in practical applications, we
may be interested only in certain components of the time series, exploring
abrupt changes in their distributions in the presence of other time series.
Here, assuming an underlying structural causal model that governs the
time-series data generation, we address this problem by proposing a two-stage
non-parametric algorithm that first learns parts of the causal structure
through constraint-based discovery methods. The algorithm then uses conditional
relative Pearson divergence estimation to identify the change points. The
conditional relative Pearson divergence quantifies the distribution disparity
between consecutive segments in the time series, while the causal discovery
method enables a focus on the causal mechanism, facilitating access to
independent and identically distributed (IID) samples. Theoretically, the
typical assumption of samples being IID in conventional change point detection
methods can be relaxed based on the Causal Markov Condition. Through
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we validate the
correctness and utility of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07290v1,,False
Towards a theory of learning dynamics in deep state space models,10/07/2024,"Jakub SmÃ©kal, Jimmy T. H. Smith, Michael Kleinman, Dan Biderman, Scott W. Linderman","State space models (SSMs) have shown remarkable empirical performance on many
long sequence modeling tasks, but a theoretical understanding of these models
is still lacking. In this work, we study the learning dynamics of linear SSMs
to understand how covariance structure in data, latent state size, and
initialization affect the evolution of parameters throughout learning with
gradient descent. We show that focusing on the learning dynamics in the
frequency domain affords analytical solutions under mild assumptions, and we
establish a link between one-dimensional SSMs and the dynamics of deep linear
feed-forward networks. Finally, we analyze how latent state
over-parameterization affects convergence time and describe future work in
extending our results to the study of deep SSMs with nonlinear connections.
This work is a step toward a theory of learning dynamics in deep state space
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.07279v1,,False
