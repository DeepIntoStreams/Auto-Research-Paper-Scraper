Protein Secondary Structure Prediction Using 3D Graphs and Relation-Aware Message Passing Transformers,17/11/2025,"Disha Varshney, Samarth Garg, Sarthak Tyagi, Deeksha Varshney, Nayan Deep, Asif Ekbal","In this study, we tackle the challenging task of predicting secondary structures from protein primary sequences, a pivotal initial stride towards predicting tertiary structures, while yielding crucial insights into protein activity, relationships, and functions. Existing methods often utilize extensive sets of unlabeled amino acid sequences. However, these approaches neither explicitly capture nor harness the accessible protein 3D structural data, which is recognized as a decisive factor in dictating protein functions. To address this, we utilize protein residue graphs and introduce various forms of sequential or structural connections to capture enhanced spatial information. We adeptly combine Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Language Models (LMs), specifically utilizing a pre-trained transformer-based protein language model to encode amino acid sequences and employing message-passing mechanisms like GCN and R-GCN to capture geometric characteristics of protein structures. Employing convolution within a specific node's nearby region, including relations, we stack multiple convolutional layers to efficiently learn combined insights from the protein's spatial graph, revealing intricate interconnections and dependencies in its structural arrangement. To assess our model's performance, we employed the training dataset provided by NetSurfP-2.0, which outlines secondary structure in 3-and 8-states. Extensive experiments show that our proposed model, SSRGNet surpasses the baseline on f1-scores.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13685v1,,False
Scientific Data Compression and Super-Resolution Sampling,17/11/2025,"Minh Vu, Andrey Lokhov","Modern scientific simulations, observations, and large-scale experiments generate data at volumes that often exceed the limits of storage, processing, and analysis. This challenge drives the development of data reduction methods that efficiently manage massive datasets while preserving essential physical features and quantities of interest. In many scientific workflows, it is also crucial to enable data recovery from compressed representations - a task known as super-resolution - with guarantees on the preservation of key physical characteristics. A notable example is checkpointing and restarting, which is essential for long-running simulations to recover from failures, resume after interruptions, or examine intermediate results. In this work, we introduce a novel framework for scientific data compression and super-resolution, grounded in recent advances in learning exponential families. Our method preserves and quantifies uncertainty in physical quantities of interest and supports flexible trade-offs between compression ratio and reconstruction fidelity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13675v1,,False
Towards Multimodal Representation Learning in Paediatric Kidney Disease,17/11/2025,"Ana Durica, John Booth, Ivana Drobnjak","Paediatric kidney disease varies widely in its presentation and progression, which calls for continuous monitoring of renal function. Using electronic health records collected between 2019 and 2025 at Great Ormond Street Hospital, a leading UK paediatric hospital, we explored a temporal modelling approach that integrates longitudinal laboratory sequences with demographic information. A recurrent neural model trained on these data was used to predict whether a child would record an abnormal serum creatinine value within the following thirty days. Framed as a pilot study, this work provides an initial demonstration that simple temporal representations can capture useful patterns in routine paediatric data and lays the groundwork for future multimodal extensions using additional clinical signals and more detailed renal outcomes.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13637v1,,False
Market-Dependent Communication in Multi-Agent Alpha Generation,17/11/2025,"Jerick Shi, Burton Hollifield","Multi-strategy hedge funds face a fundamental organizational choice: should analysts generating trading strategies communicate, and if so, how? We investigate this using 5-agent LLM-based trading systems across 450 experiments spanning 21 months, comparing five organizational structures from isolated baseline to collaborative and competitive conversation. We show that communication improves performance, but optimal communication design depends on market characteristics. Competitive conversation excels in volatile technology stocks, while collaborative conversation dominates stable general stocks. Finance stocks resist all communication interventions. Surprisingly, all structures, including isolated agents, converge to similar strategy alignments, challenging assumptions that transparency causes harmful diversity loss. Performance differences stem from behavioral mechanisms: competitive agents focus on stock-level allocation while collaborative agents develop technical frameworks. Conversation quality scores show zero correlation with returns. These findings demonstrate that optimal communication design must match market volatility characteristics, and sophisticated discussions don't guarantee better performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13614v1,,False
FreeAskWorld: An Interactive and Closed-Loop Simulator for Human-Centric Embodied AI,17/11/2025,"Yuhang Peng, Yizhou Pan, Xinning He, Jihaoyu Yang, Xinyu Yin, Han Wang, Xiaoji Zheng, Chao Gao, Jiangtao Gong","As embodied intelligence emerges as a core frontier in artificial intelligence research, simulation platforms must evolve beyond low-level physical interactions to capture complex, human-centered social behaviors. We introduce FreeAskWorld, an interactive simulation framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) for high-level behavior planning and semantically grounded interaction, informed by theories of intention and social cognition. Our framework supports scalable, realistic human-agent simulations and includes a modular data generation pipeline tailored for diverse embodied tasks.To validate the framework, we extend the classic Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) task into a interaction enriched Direction Inquiry setting, wherein agents can actively seek and interpret navigational guidance. We present and publicly release FreeAskWorld, a large-scale benchmark dataset comprising reconstructed environments, six diverse task types, 16 core object categories, 63,429 annotated sample frames, and more than 17 hours of interaction data to support training and evaluation of embodied AI systems. We benchmark VLN models, and human participants under both open-loop and closed-loop settings. Experimental results demonstrate that models fine-tuned on FreeAskWorld outperform their original counterparts, achieving enhanced semantic understanding and interaction competency. These findings underscore the efficacy of socially grounded simulation frameworks in advancing embodied AI systems toward sophisticated high-level planning and more naturalistic human-agent interaction.

Naga: Vedic Encoding for Deep State Space Models,17/11/2025,"Melanie Schaller, Nick Janssen, Bodo Rosenhahn","This paper presents Naga, a deep State Space Model (SSM) encoding approach inspired by structural concepts from Vedic mathematics. The proposed method introduces a bidirectional representation for time series by jointly processing forward and time-reversed input sequences. These representations are then combined through an element-wise (Hadamard) interaction, resulting in a Vedic-inspired encoding that enhances the model's ability to capture temporal dependencies across distant time steps. We evaluate Naga on multiple long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) benchmarks, including ETTh1, ETTh2, ETTm1, ETTm2, Weather, Traffic, and ILI. The experimental results show that Naga outperforms 28 current state of the art models and demonstrates improved efficiency compared to existing deep SSM-based approaches. The findings suggest that incorporating structured, Vedic-inspired decomposition can provide an interpretable and computationally efficient alternative for long-range sequence modeling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13510v1,,False
GREAT: Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations for Zero-Shot Environmental Prediction,17/11/2025,"Shiyuan Luo, Chonghao Qiu, Runlong Yu, Yiqun Xie, Xiaowei Jia","Environmental modeling faces critical challenges in predicting ecosystem dynamics across unmonitored regions due to limited and geographically imbalanced observation data. This challenge is compounded by spatial heterogeneity, causing models to learn spurious patterns that fit only local data. Unlike conventional domain generalization, environmental modeling must preserve invariant physical relationships and temporal coherence during augmentation. In this paper, we introduce Generalizable Representation Enhancement via Auxiliary Transformations (GREAT), a framework that effectively augments available datasets to improve predictions in completely unseen regions. GREAT guides the augmentation process to ensure that the original governing processes can be recovered from the augmented data, and the inclusion of the augmented data leads to improved model generalization. Specifically, GREAT learns transformation functions at multiple layers of neural networks to augment both raw environmental features and temporal influence. They are refined through a novel bi-level training process that constrains augmented data to preserve key patterns of the original source data. We demonstrate GREAT's effectiveness on stream temperature prediction across six ecologically diverse watersheds in the eastern U.S., each containing multiple stream segments. Experimental results show that GREAT significantly outperforms existing methods in zero-shot scenarios. This work provides a practical solution for environmental applications where comprehensive monitoring is infeasible.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13469v1,,False
Artificial Intelligence-Enabled Spirometry for Early Detection of Right Heart Failure,17/11/2025,"Bin Liu, Qinghao Zhao, Yuxi Zhou, Zhejun Sun, Kaijie Lei, Deyun Zhang, Shijia Geng, Shenda Hong","Right heart failure (RHF) is a disease characterized by abnormalities in the structure or function of the right ventricle (RV), which is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Lung disease often causes increased right ventricular load, leading to RHF. Therefore, it is very important to screen out patients with cor pulmonale who develop RHF from people with underlying lung diseases. In this work, we propose a self-supervised representation learning method to early detecting RHF from patients with cor pulmonale, which uses spirogram time series to predict patients with RHF at an early stage. The proposed model is divided into two stages. The first stage is the self-supervised representation learning-based spirogram embedding (SLSE) network training process, where the encoder of the Variational autoencoder (VAE-encoder) learns a robust low-dimensional representation of the spirogram time series from the data-augmented unlabeled data. Second, this low-dimensional representation is fused with demographic information and fed into a CatBoost classifier for the downstream RHF prediction task. Trained and tested on a carefully selected subset of 26,617 individuals from the UK Biobank, our model achieved an AUROC of 0.7501 in detecting RHF, demonstrating strong population-level distinction ability. We further evaluated the model on high-risk clinical subgroups, achieving AUROC values of 0.8194 on a test set of 74 patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and 0.8413 on a set of 64 patients with valvular heart disease (VHD). These results highlight the model's potential utility in predicting RHF among clinically elevated-risk populations. In conclusion, this study presents a self-supervised representation learning approach combining spirogram time series and demographic data, demonstrating promising potential for early RHF detection in clinical practice.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13457v1,,False
Discovering Operational Patterns Using Image-Based Convolutional Clustering and Composite Evaluation: A Case Study in Foundry Melting Processes,17/11/2025,"Zhipeng Ma, Bo Nørregaard Jørgensen, Zheng Grace Ma","Industrial process monitoring increasingly relies on sensor-generated time-series data, yet the lack of labels, high variability, and operational noise make it difficult to extract meaningful patterns using conventional methods. Existing clustering techniques either rely on fixed distance metrics or deep models designed for static data, limiting their ability to handle dynamic, unstructured industrial sequences. Addressing this gap, this paper proposes a novel framework for unsupervised discovery of operational modes in univariate time-series data using image-based convolutional clustering with composite internal evaluation. The proposed framework improves upon existing approaches in three ways: (1) raw time-series sequences are transformed into grayscale matrix representations via overlapping sliding windows, allowing effective feature extraction using a deep convolutional autoencoder; (2) the framework integrates both soft and hard clustering outputs and refines the selection through a two-stage strategy; and (3) clustering performance is objectively evaluated by a newly developed composite score, S_eva, which combines normalized Silhouette, Calinski-Harabasz, and Davies-Bouldin indices. Applied to over 3900 furnace melting operations from a Nordic foundry, the method identifies seven explainable operational patterns, revealing significant differences in energy consumption, thermal dynamics, and production duration. Compared to classical and deep clustering baselines, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance, greater robustness, and domain-aligned explainability. The framework addresses key challenges in unsupervised time-series analysis, such as sequence irregularity, overlapping modes, and metric inconsistency, and provides a generalizable solution for data-driven diagnostics and energy optimization in industrial systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13444v1,10.3390/info16090816,False
Descriptor: Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA),17/11/2025,"Nikos Theodoridis, Tim Brophy, Reenu Mohandas, Ganesh Sistu, Fiachra Collins, Anthony Scanlan, Ciaran Eising","The remarkable progress of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on a variety of tasks has raised interest in their application to automated driving. However, for these models to be trusted in such a safety-critical domain, they must first possess robust perception capabilities, i.e., they must be capable of understanding a traffic scene, which can often be highly complex, with many things happening simultaneously. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at long distances, we require systems with not only strong perception capabilities at close distances (up to 20 meters), but also at long (30+ meters) range. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the perception capabilities of these models in isolation from other skills like reasoning or advanced world knowledge. Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA) is a Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark designed specifically for this purpose: it can be used to evaluate the perception systems of VLMs in traffic scenarios using trivial yet crucial questions relevant to driving decisions. It consists of two parts: a synthetic benchmark (DTP-Synthetic) created using a simulator, and a real-world benchmark (DTP-Real) built on top of existing images of real traffic scenes. Additionally, DTPQA includes distance annotations, i.e., how far the object in question is from the camera. More specifically, each DTPQA sample consists of (at least): (a) an image, (b) a question, (c) the ground truth answer, and (d) the distance of the object in question, enabling analysis of how VLM performance degrades with increasing object distance. In this article, we provide the dataset itself along with the Python scripts used to create it, which can be used to generate additional data of the same kind.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13397v1,,False
EL3DD: Extended Latent 3D Diffusion for Language Conditioned Multitask Manipulation,17/11/2025,"Jonas Bode, Raphael Memmesheimer, Sven Behnke","Acting in human environments is a crucial capability for general-purpose robots, necessitating a robust understanding of natural language and its application to physical tasks. This paper seeks to harness the capabilities of diffusion models within a visuomotor policy framework that merges visual and textual inputs to generate precise robotic trajectories. By employing reference demonstrations during training, the model learns to execute manipulation tasks specified through textual commands within the robot's immediate environment. The proposed research aims to extend an existing model by leveraging improved embeddings, and adapting techniques from diffusion models for image generation. We evaluate our methods on the CALVIN dataset, proving enhanced performance on various manipulation tasks and an increased long-horizon success rate when multiple tasks are executed in sequence. Our approach reinforces the usefulness of diffusion models and contributes towards general multitask manipulation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13312v1,,False
Asymptotic confidence bands for centered purely random forests,17/11/2025,"Natalie Neumeyer, Jan Rabe, Mathias Trabs","In a multivariate nonparametric regression setting we construct explicit asymptotic uniform confidence bands for centered purely random forests. Since the most popular example in this class of random forests, namely the uniformly centered purely random forests, is well known to suffer from suboptimal rates, we propose a new type of purely random forests, called the Ehrenfest centered purely random forests, which achieve minimax optimal rates. Our main confidence band theorem applies to both random forests. The proof is based on an interpretation of random forests as generalized U-Statistics together with a Gaussian approximation of the supremum of empirical processes. Our theoretical findings are illustrated in simulation examples.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13199v1,,False
ParaDySe: A Parallel-Strategy Switching Framework for Dynamic Sequence Lengths in Transformer,17/11/2025,"Zhixin Ou, Peng Liang, Jianchen Han, Baihui Liu, Linbo Qiao","Dynamic sequences with varying lengths have been widely used in the training of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). However, current training frameworks adopt a pre-defined static parallel strategy for these sequences, causing neither communication-parallelization cancellation on short sequences nor out-of-memory on long sequences. To mitigate these issues, we propose ParaDySe, a novel adaptive Parallel strategy switching framework for Dynamic Sequences. ParaDySe enables on-the-fly optimal strategy adoption according to the immediate input sequence. It first implements the modular function libraries for parallel strategies with unified tensor layout specifications, and then builds sequence-aware memory and time cost models with hybrid methods. Guided by cost models, ParaDySe selects optimal layer-wise strategies for dynamic sequences via an efficient heuristic algorithm. By integrating these techniques together, ParaDySe achieves seamless hot-switching of optimal strategies through its well-designed function libraries. We compare ParaDySe with baselines on representative LLMs under datasets with sequence lengths up to 624K. Experimental results indicate that ParaDySe addresses OOM and CPC bottlenecks in LLM training by systematically integrating long-sequence optimizations with existing frameworks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13198v1,,False
DiffFP: Learning Behaviors from Scratch via Diffusion-based Fictitious Play,17/11/2025,"Akash Karthikeyan, Yash Vardhan Pant","Self-play reinforcement learning has demonstrated significant success in learning complex strategic and interactive behaviors in competitive multi-agent games. However, achieving such behaviors in continuous decision spaces remains challenging. Ensuring adaptability and generalization in self-play settings is critical for achieving competitive performance in dynamic multi-agent environments. These challenges often cause methods to converge slowly or fail to converge at all to a Nash equilibrium, making agents vulnerable to strategic exploitation by unseen opponents. To address these challenges, we propose DiffFP, a fictitious play (FP) framework that estimates the best response to unseen opponents while learning a robust and multimodal behavioral policy. Specifically, we approximate the best response using a diffusion policy that leverages generative modeling to learn adaptive and diverse strategies. Through empirical evaluation, we demonstrate that the proposed FP framework converges towards $ε$-Nash equilibria in continuous- space zero-sum games. We validate our method on complex multi-agent environments, including racing and multi-particle zero-sum games. Simulation results show that the learned policies are robust against diverse opponents and outperform baseline reinforcement learning policies. Our approach achieves up to 3$\times$ faster convergence and 30$\times$ higher success rates on average against RL-based baselines, demonstrating its robustness to opponent strategies and stability across training iterations",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13186v1,,False
Real-time distortion prediction in metallic additive manufacturing via a physics-informed neural operator approach,17/11/2025,"Mingxuan Tian, Haochen Mu, Donghong Ding, Mengjiao Li, Yuhan Ding, Jianping Zhao","With the development of digital twins and smart manufacturing systems, there is an urgent need for real-time distortion field prediction to control defects in metal Additive Manufacturing (AM). However, numerical simulation methods suffer from high computational cost, long run-times that prevent real-time use, while conventional Machine learning (ML) models struggle to extract spatiotemporal features for long-horizon prediction and fail to decouple thermo-mechanical fields. This paper proposes a Physics-informed Neural Operator (PINO) to predict z and y-direction distortion for the future 15 s. Our method, Physics-informed Deep Operator Network-Recurrent Neural Network (PIDeepONet-RNN) employs trunk and branch network to process temperature history and encode distortion fields, respectively, enabling decoupling of thermo-mechanical responses. By incorporating the heat conduction equation as a soft constraint, the model ensures physical consistency and suppresses unphysical artifacts, thereby establishing a more physically consistent mapping between the thermal history and distortion. This is important because such a basis function, grounded in physical laws, provides a robust and interpretable foundation for predictions. The proposed models are trained and tested using datasets generated from experimentally validated Finite Element Method (FEM). Evaluation shows that the model achieves high accuracy, low error accumulation, time efficiency. The max absolute errors in the z and y-directions are as low as 0.9733 mm and 0.2049 mm, respectively. The error distribution shows high errors in the molten pool but low gradient norms in the deposited and key areas. The performance of PINO surrogate model highlights its potential for real-time long-horizon physics field prediction in controlling defects.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13178v1,,False
OTARo: Once Tuning for All Precisions toward Robust On-Device LLMs,17/11/2025,"Shaoyuan Chen, Zhixuan Chen, Dawei Yang, Zhihang Yuan, Qiang Wu","Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuning techniques not only improve the adaptability to diverse downstream tasks, but also mitigate adverse effects of model quantization. Despite this, conventional quantization suffers from its structural limitation that hinders flexibility during the fine-tuning and deployment stages. Practical on-device tasks demand different quantization precisions (i.e. different bit-widths), e.g., understanding tasks tend to exhibit higher tolerance to reduced precision compared to generation tasks. Conventional quantization, typically relying on scaling factors that are incompatible across bit-widths, fails to support the on-device switching of precisions when confronted with complex real-world scenarios. To overcome the dilemma, we propose OTARo, a novel method that enables on-device LLMs to flexibly switch quantization precisions while maintaining performance robustness through once fine-tuning. OTARo introduces Shared Exponent Floating Point (SEFP), a distinct quantization mechanism, to produce different bit-widths through simple mantissa truncations of a single model. Moreover, to achieve bit-width robustness in downstream applications, OTARo performs a learning process toward losses induced by different bit-widths. The method involves two critical strategies: (1) Exploitation-Exploration Bit-Width Path Search (BPS), which iteratively updates the search path via a designed scoring mechanism; (2) Low-Precision Asynchronous Accumulation (LAA), which performs asynchronous gradient accumulations and delayed updates under low bit-widths. Experiments on popular LLMs, e.g., LLaMA3.2-1B, LLaMA3-8B, demonstrate that OTARo achieves consistently strong and robust performance for all precisions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13147v1,,False
Region-Point Joint Representation for Effective Trajectory Similarity Learning,17/11/2025,"Hao Long, Silin Zhou, Lisi Chen, Shuo Shang","Recent learning-based methods have reduced the computational complexity of traditional trajectory similarity computation, but state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods still fail to leverage the comprehensive spectrum of trajectory information for similarity modeling. To tackle this problem, we propose \textbf{RePo}, a novel method that jointly encodes \textbf{Re}gion-wise and \textbf{Po}int-wise features to capture both spatial context and fine-grained moving patterns. For region-wise representation, the GPS trajectories are first mapped to grid sequences, and spatial context are captured by structural features and semantic context enriched by visual features. For point-wise representation, three lightweight expert networks extract local, correlation, and continuous movement patterns from dense GPS sequences. Then, a router network adaptively fuses the learned point-wise features, which are subsequently combined with region-wise features using cross-attention to produce the final trajectory embedding. To train RePo, we adopt a contrastive loss with hard negative samples to provide similarity ranking supervision. Experiment results show that RePo achieves an average accuracy improvement of 22.2\% over SOTA baselines across all evaluation metrics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13125v1,,False
Departures: Distributional Transport for Single-Cell Perturbation Prediction with Neural Schrödinger Bridges,17/11/2025,"Changxi Chi, Yufei Huang, Jun Xia, Jiangbin Zheng, Yunfan Liu, Zelin Zang, Stan Z. Li","Predicting single-cell perturbation outcomes directly advances gene function analysis and facilitates drug candidate selection, making it a key driver of both basic and translational biomedical research. However, a major bottleneck in this task is the unpaired nature of single-cell data, as the same cell cannot be observed both before and after perturbation due to the destructive nature of sequencing. Although some neural generative transport models attempt to tackle unpaired single-cell perturbation data, they either lack explicit conditioning or depend on prior spaces for indirect distribution alignment, limiting precise perturbation modeling. In this work, we approximate Schrödinger Bridge (SB), which defines stochastic dynamic mappings recovering the entropy-regularized optimal transport (OT), to directly align the distributions of control and perturbed single-cell populations across different perturbation conditions. Unlike prior SB approximations that rely on bidirectional modeling to infer optimal source-target sample coupling, we leverage Minibatch-OT based pairing to avoid such bidirectional inference and the associated ill-posedness of defining the reverse process. This pairing directly guides bridge learning, yielding a scalable approximation to the SB. We approximate two SB models, one modeling discrete gene activation states and the other continuous expression distributions. Joint training enables accurate perturbation modeling and captures single-cell heterogeneity. Experiments on public genetic and drug perturbation datasets show that our model effectively captures heterogeneous single-cell responses and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13124v1,,False

Orsoe, Stephan Meighen-Berger, Jeffrey Lazar, Jorge Prado, Ivan Mozun-Mateo, Aske Rosted, Philip Weigel, Arturo Llorente Anaya","Neutrino telescopes are large-scale detectors designed to observe Cherenkov radiation produced from neutrino interactions in water or ice. They exist to identify extraterrestrial neutrino sources and to probe fundamental questions pertaining to the elusive neutrino itself. A central challenge common across neutrino telescopes is to solve a series of inverse problems known as event reconstruction, which seeks to resolve properties of the incident neutrino, based on the detected Cherenkov light. In recent times, significant efforts have been made in adapting advances from deep learning research to event reconstruction, as such techniques provide several benefits over traditional methods. While a large degree of similarity in reconstruction needs and low-level data exists, cross-experimental collaboration has been hindered by a lack of diverse open-source datasets for comparing methods.
  We present NuBench, an open benchmark for deep learning-based event reconstruction in neutrino telescopes. NuBench comprises seven large-scale simulated datasets containing nearly 130 million charged- and neutral-current muon-neutrino interactions spanning 10 GeV to 100 TeV, generated across six detector geometries inspired by existing and proposed experiments. These datasets provide pulse- and event-level information suitable for developing and comparing machine-learning reconstruction methods in both water and ice environments. Using NuBench, we evaluate four reconstruction algorithms - ParticleNeT and DynEdge, both actively used within the KM3NeT and IceCube collaborations, respectively, along with GRIT and DeepIce - on up to five core tasks: energy and direction reconstruction, topology classification, interaction vertex prediction, and inelasticity estimation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.13111v1,,False
Learning Time-Scale Invariant Population-Level Neural Representations,17/11/2025,"Eshani Patel, Yisong Yue, Geeling Chau","General-purpose foundation models for neural time series can help accelerate neuroscientific discoveries and enable applications such as brain computer interfaces (BCIs). A key component in scaling these models is population-level representation learning, which leverages information across channels to capture spatial as well as temporal structure. Population-level approaches have recently shown that such representations can be both efficient to learn on top of pretrained temporal encoders and produce useful representations for decoding a variety of downstream tasks. However, these models remain sensitive to mismatches in preprocessing, particularly on time-scales, between pretraining and downstream settings. We systematically examine how time-scale mismatches affects generalization and find that existing representations lack invariance. To address this, we introduce Time-scale Augmented Pretraining (TSAP), which consistently improves robustness to different time-scales across decoding tasks and builds invariance in the representation space.

Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion for Enhanced Solar Flare Prediction from Multivariate Time Series,17/11/2025,"Onur Vural, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi","Multivariate time series classification is increasingly investigated in space weather research as a means to predict intense solar flare events, which can cause widespread disruptions across modern technological systems. Magnetic field measurements of solar active regions are converted into structured multivariate time series, enabling predictive modeling across segmented observation windows. However, the inherently imbalanced nature of solar flare occurrences, where intense flares are rare compared to minor flare events, presents a significant barrier to effective learning. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Global Cross-Time Attention Fusion (GCTAF) architecture, a transformer-based model to enhance long-range temporal modeling. Unlike traditional self-attention mechanisms that rely solely on local interactions within time series, GCTAF injects a set of learnable cross-attentive global tokens that summarize salient temporal patterns across the entire sequence. These tokens are refined through cross-attention with the input sequence and fused back into the temporal representation, enabling the model to identify globally significant, non-contiguous time points that are critical for flare prediction. This mechanism functions as a dynamic attention-driven temporal summarizer that augments the model's capacity to capture discriminative flare-related dynamics. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark solar flare dataset and show that GCTAF effectively detects intense flares and improves predictive performance, demonstrating that refining transformer-based architectures presents a high-potential alternative for solar flare prediction tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12955v1,,False
APT: Affine Prototype-Timestamp For Time Series Forecasting Under Distribution Shift,17/11/2025,"Yujie Li, Zezhi Shao, Chengqing Yu, Yisong Fu, Tao Sun, Yongjun Xu, Fei Wang","Time series forecasting under distribution shift remains challenging, as existing deep learning models often rely on local statistical normalization (e.g., mean and variance) that fails to capture global distribution shift. Methods like RevIN and its variants attempt to decouple distribution and pattern but still struggle with missing values, noisy observations, and invalid channel-wise affine transformation. To address these limitations, we propose Affine Prototype Timestamp (APT), a lightweight and flexible plug-in module that injects global distribution features into the normalization-forecasting pipeline. By leveraging timestamp conditioned prototype learning, APT dynamically generates affine parameters that modulate both input and output series, enabling the backbone to learn from self-supervised, distribution-aware clustered instances. APT is compatible with arbitrary forecasting backbones and normalization strategies while introducing minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across six benchmark datasets and multiple backbone-normalization combinations demonstrate that APT significantly improves forecasting performance under distribution shift.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12945v1,,False
Yanyun-3: Enabling Cross-Platform Strategy Game Operation with Vision-Language Models,17/11/2025,"Guoyan Wang, Yanyan Huang, Chunlin Chen, Lifeng Wang, Yuxiang Sun","Automated operation in cross-platform strategy games demands agents with robust generalization across diverse user interfaces and dynamic battlefield conditions. While vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable promise in multimodal reasoning, their application to complex human-computer interaction scenarios--such as strategy gaming--remains largely unexplored. Here, we introduce Yanyun-3, a general-purpose agent framework that, for the first time, enables autonomous cross-platform operation across three heterogeneous strategy game environments. By integrating the vision-language reasoning of Qwen2.5-VL with the precise execution capabilities of UI-TARS, Yanyun-3 successfully performs core tasks including target localization, combat resource allocation, and area control. Through systematic ablation studies, we evaluate the effects of various multimodal data combinations--static images, multi-image sequences, and videos--and propose the concept of combination granularity to differentiate between intra-sample fusion and inter-sample mixing strategies. We find that a hybrid strategy, which fuses multi-image and video data while mixing in static images (MV+S), substantially outperforms full fusion: it reduces inference time by 63% and boosts the BLEU-4 score by a factor of 12 (from 4.81% to 62.41%, approximately 12.98x). Operating via a closed-loop pipeline of screen capture, model inference, and action execution, the agent demonstrates strong real-time performance and cross-platform generalization. Beyond providing an efficient solution for strategy game automation, our work establishes a general paradigm for enhancing VLM performance through structured multimodal data organization, offering new insights into the interplay between static perception and dynamic reasoning in embodied intelligence.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12937v1,,False

Method of Manufactured Learning for Solver-free Training of Neural Operators,17/11/2025,"Arth Sojitra, Omer San","Training neural operators to approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces often requires extensive datasets generated by either demanding experimental setups or computationally expensive numerical solvers. This dependence on solver-based data limits scalability and constrains exploration across physical systems. Here we introduce the Method of Manufactured Learning (MML), a solver-independent framework for training neural operators using analytically constructed, physics-consistent datasets. Inspired by the classical method of manufactured solutions, MML replaces numerical data generation with functional synthesis, i.e., smooth candidate solutions are sampled from controlled analytical spaces, and the corresponding forcing fields are derived by direct application of the governing differential operators. During inference, setting these forcing terms to zero restores the original governing equations, allowing the trained neural operator to emulate the true solution operator of the system. The framework is agnostic to network architecture and can be integrated with any operator learning paradigm. In this paper, we employ Fourier neural operator as a representative example. Across canonical benchmarks including heat, advection, Burgers, and diffusion-reaction equations. MML achieves high spectral accuracy, low residual errors, and strong generalization to unseen conditions. By reframing data generation as a process of analytical synthesis, MML offers a scalable, solver-agnostic pathway toward constructing physically grounded neural operators that retain fidelity to governing laws without reliance on expensive numerical simulations or costly experimental data for training.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12890v1,,False
Bootstrapping LLMs via Preference-Based Policy Optimization,17/11/2025,Chen Jia,"Bootstrapping large language models (LLMs) through preference-based policy optimization offers a promising direction for aligning model behavior with human preferences without relying on extensive manual annotations. In this work, we propose a novel preference-based policy optimization (PbPO) framework that formulates the learning process as a min-max game between the main policy and a reward model (RM). The RM is constrained within a confidence set derived from preference data to ensure reliable exploitation. Our iterative online algorithm actively collects preference data through guided exploration of the evolving policy, enabling continual self-improvement of both the policy and the RM. We provide theoretical guarantees for our method, establishing high-probability regret bounds for both settings with sequence-level RM and token-level RM, demonstrating its effectiveness in bootstrapping LLMs. Extensive experiments on five benchmarks show that our approach consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art preference optimization techniques.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12867v1,,False
RoS-Guard: Robust and Scalable Online Change Detection with Delay-Optimal Guarantees,17/11/2025,"Zelin Zhu, Yancheng Huang, Kai Yang","Online change detection (OCD) aims to rapidly identify change points in streaming data and is critical in applications such as power system monitoring, wireless network sensing, and financial anomaly detection. Existing OCD methods typically assume precise system knowledge, which is unrealistic due to estimation errors and environmental variations. Moreover, existing OCD methods often struggle with efficiency in large-scale systems. To overcome these challenges, we propose RoS-Guard, a robust and optimal OCD algorithm tailored for linear systems with uncertainty. Through a tight relaxation and reformulation of the OCD optimization problem, RoS-Guard employs neural unrolling to enable efficient parallel computation via GPU acceleration. The algorithm provides theoretical guarantees on performance, including expected false alarm rate and worst-case average detection delay. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of RoS-Guard and demonstrate significant computational speedup in large-scale system scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12846v1,,False
Scalable learning of macroscopic stochastic dynamics,17/11/2025,"Mengyi Chen, Pengru Huang, Kostya S. Novoselov, Qianxiao Li","Macroscopic dynamical descriptions of complex physical systems are crucial for understanding and controlling material behavior. With the growing availability of data and compute, machine learning has become a promising alternative to first-principles methods to build accurate macroscopic models from microscopic trajectory simulations. However, for spatially extended systems, direct simulations of sufficiently large microscopic systems that inform macroscopic behavior is prohibitive. In this work, we propose a framework that learns the macroscopic dynamics of large stochastic microscopic systems using only small-system simulations. Our framework employs a partial evolution scheme to generate training data pairs by evolving large-system snapshots within local patches. We subsequently identify the closure variables associated with the macroscopic observables and learn the macroscopic dynamics using a custom loss. Furthermore, we introduce a hierarchical upsampling scheme that enables efficient generation of large-system snapshots from small-system trajectory distributions. We empirically demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of our framework through a variety of stochastic spatially extended systems, including those described by stochastic partial differential equations, idealised lattice spin systems, and a more realistic NbMoTa alloy system.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.12842v1,,False
