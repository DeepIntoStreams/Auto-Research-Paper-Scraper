SAFE--MA--RRT: Multi-Agent Motion Planning with Data-Driven Safety Certificates,04/09/2025,"Babak Esmaeili, Hamidreza Modares","This paper proposes a fully data-driven motion-planning framework for
homogeneous linear multi-agent systems that operate in shared, obstacle-filled
workspaces without access to explicit system models. Each agent independently
learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex
semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and
corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based
waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and
define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of
such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids
overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All
agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a
space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing
simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree
is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without
re-solving optimization problems at runtime. The resulting trajectories are not
only dynamically feasible but also provably safe with respect to both
environmental constraints and inter-agent collisions. Simulation results
demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach in synthesizing synchronized,
safe trajectories for multiple agents under shared dynamics and constraints,
using only data and convex optimization tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04413v1,,False
PagedEviction: Structured Block-wise KV Cache Pruning for Efficient Large Language Model Inference,04/09/2025,"Krishna Teja Chitty-Venkata, Jie Ye, Xian-He Sun, Anthony Kougkas, Murali Emani, Venkatram Vishwanath, Bogdan Nicolae","KV caching significantly improves the efficiency of Large Language Model
(LLM) inference by storing attention states from previously processed tokens,
enabling faster generation of subsequent tokens. However, as sequence length
increases, the KV cache quickly becomes a major memory bottleneck. To address
this, we propose PagedEviction, a novel fine-grained, structured KV cache
pruning strategy that enhances the memory efficiency of vLLM's PagedAttention.
Unlike existing approaches that rely on attention-based token importance or
evict tokens across different vLLM pages, PagedEviction introduces an efficient
block-wise eviction algorithm tailored for paged memory layouts. Our method
integrates seamlessly with PagedAttention without requiring any modifications
to its CUDA attention kernels. We evaluate PagedEviction across
Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct, Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct, and Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct models
on the LongBench benchmark suite, demonstrating improved memory usage with
better accuracy than baselines on long context tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04377v1,,False
Using causal abstractions to accelerate decision-making in complex bandit problems,04/09/2025,"Joel Dyer, Nicholas Bishop, Anisoara Calinescu, Michael Wooldridge, Fabio Massimo Zennaro","Although real-world decision-making problems can often be encoded as causal
multi-armed bandits (CMABs) at different levels of abstraction, a general
methodology exploiting the information and computational advantages of each
abstraction level is missing. In this paper, we propose AT-UCB, an algorithm
which efficiently exploits shared information between CMAB problem instances
defined at different levels of abstraction. More specifically, AT-UCB leverages
causal abstraction (CA) theory to explore within a cheap-to-simulate and
coarse-grained CMAB instance, before employing the traditional upper confidence
bound (UCB) algorithm on a restricted set of potentially optimal actions in the
CMAB of interest, leading to significant reductions in cumulative regret when
compared to the classical UCB algorithm. We illustrate the advantages of AT-UCB
theoretically, through a novel upper bound on the cumulative regret, and
empirically, by applying AT-UCB to epidemiological simulators with varying
resolution and computational cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04296v1,,False
Rethinking the long-range dependency in Mamba/SSM and transformer models,04/09/2025,"Cong Ma, Kayvan Najarian","Long-range dependency is one of the most desired properties of recent
sequence models such as state-space models (particularly Mamba) and transformer
models. New model architectures are being actively developed and benchmarked
for prediction tasks requiring long-range dependency. However, the capability
of modeling long-range dependencies of these models has not been investigated
from a theoretical perspective, which hinders a systematic improvement on this
aspect. In this work, we mathematically define long-range dependency using the
derivative of hidden states with respect to past inputs and compare the
capability of SSM and transformer models of modeling long-range dependency
based on this definition. We showed that the long-range dependency of SSM
decays exponentially with the sequence length, which aligns with the
exponential decay of memory function in RNN. But the attention mechanism used
in transformers is more flexible and is not constrained to exponential decay,
which could in theory perform better at modeling long-range dependency with
sufficient training data, computing resources, and proper training. To combine
the flexibility of long-range dependency of attention mechanism and computation
efficiency of SSM, we propose a new formulation for hidden state update in SSM
and prove its stability under a standard Gaussian distribution of the input
data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04226v1,,False
Sharp Convergence Rates of Empirical Unbalanced Optimal Transport for Spatio-Temporal Point Processes,04/09/2025,"Marina Struleva, Shayan Hundrieser, Dominic Schuhmacher, Axel Munk","We statistically analyze empirical plug-in estimators for unbalanced optimal
transport (UOT) formalisms, focusing on the Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance,
between general intensity measures based on observations from spatio-temporal
point processes. Specifically, we model the observations by two weakly
time-stationary point processes with spatial intensity measures $\mu$ and $\nu$
over the expanding window $(0,t]$ as $t$ increases to infinity, and establish
sharp convergence rates of the empirical UOT in terms of the intrinsic
dimensions of the measures. We assume a sub-quadratic temporal growth condition
of the variance of the process, which allows for a wide range of temporal
dependencies. As the growth approaches quadratic, the convergence rate becomes
slower. This variance assumption is related to the time-reduced factorial
covariance measure, and we exemplify its validity for various point processes,
including the Poisson cluster, Hawkes, Neyman-Scott, and log-Gaussian Cox
processes. Complementary to our upper bounds, we also derive matching lower
bounds for various spatio-temporal point processes of interest and establish
near minimax rate optimality of the empirical Kantorovich-Rubinstein distance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04225v1,,False
Domain size asymptotics for Markov logic networks,04/09/2025,Vera Koponen,"A Markov logic network (MLN) determines a probability distribution on the set
of structures, or ``possible worlds'', with an arbitrary finite domain. We
study the properties of such distributions as the domain size tends to
infinity. Three types of concrete examples of MLNs will be considered, and the
properties of random structures with domain sizes tending to infinity will be
studied: (1) Arbitrary quantifier-free MLNs over a language with only one
relation symbol which has arity 1. In this case we give a pretty complete
characterization of the possible limit behaviours of random structures. (2) An
MLN that favours graphs with fewer triangles (or more generally, fewer
k-cliques). As a corollary of the analysis a ``$\delta$-approximate 0-1 law''
for first-order logic is obtained. (3) An MLN that favours graphs with fewer
vertices with degree higher than a fixed (but arbitrary) number. The analysis
shows that depending on which ``soft constraints'' an MLN uses the limit
behaviour of random structures can be quite different, and the weights of the
soft constraints may, or may not, have influence on the limit behaviour. It
will also be demonstrated, using (1), that quantifier-free MLNs and lifted
Bayesian networks (in a broad sense) are asymptotically incomparable, roughly
meaning that there is a sequence of distributions on possible worlds with
increasing domain sizes that can be defined by one of the formalisms but not
even approximated by the other. In a rather general context it is also shown
that on large domains the distribution determined by an MLN concentrates almost
all its probability mass on a totally different part of the space of possible
worlds than the uniform distribution does.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04192v1,,False
The human biological advantage over AI,04/09/2025,William Stewart,"Recent advances in AI raise the possibility that AI systems will one day be
able to do anything humans can do, only better. If artificial general
intelligence (AGI) is achieved, AI systems may be able to understand, reason,
problem solve, create, and evolve at a level and speed that humans will
increasingly be unable to match, or even understand. These possibilities raise
a natural question as to whether AI will eventually become superior to humans,
a successor ""digital species"", with a rightful claim to assume leadership of
the universe. However, a deeper consideration suggests the overlooked
differentiator between human beings and AI is not the brain, but the central
nervous system (CNS), providing us with an immersive integration with physical
reality. It is our CNS that enables us to experience emotion including pain,
joy, suffering, and love, and therefore to fully appreciate the consequences of
our actions on the world around us. And that emotional understanding of the
consequences of our actions is what is required to be able to develop
sustainable ethical systems, and so be fully qualified to be the leaders of the
universe. A CNS cannot be manufactured or simulated; it must be grown as a
biological construct. And so, even the development of consciousness will not be
sufficient to make AI systems superior to humans. AI systems may become more
capable than humans on almost every measure and transform our society. However,
the best foundation for leadership of our universe will always be DNA, not
silicon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04130v1,10.1007/s00146-024-02112-w,False
Keypoint-based Diffusion for Robotic Motion Planning on the NICOL Robot,04/09/2025,"Lennart Clasmeier, Jan-Gerrit Habekost, Connor Gäde, Philipp Allgeuer, Stefan Wermter","We propose a novel diffusion-based action model for robotic motion planning.
Commonly, established numerical planning approaches are used to solve general
motion planning problems, but have significant runtime requirements. By
leveraging the power of deep learning, we are able to achieve good results in a
much smaller runtime by learning from a dataset generated by these planners.
While our initial model uses point cloud embeddings in the input to predict
keypoint-based joint sequences in its output, we observed in our ablation study
that it remained challenging to condition the network on the point cloud
embeddings. We identified some biases in our dataset and refined it, which
improved the model's performance. Our model, even without the use of the point
cloud encodings, outperforms numerical models by an order of magnitude
regarding the runtime, while reaching a success rate of up to 90% of collision
free solutions on the test set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04076v1,,False
Balancing Signal and Variance: Adaptive Offline RL Post-Training for VLA Flow Models,04/09/2025,"Hongyin Zhang, Shiyuan Zhang, Junxi Jin, Qixin Zeng, Yifan Qiao, Hongchao Lu, Donglin Wang","Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models based on flow matching have shown
excellent performance in general-purpose robotic manipulation tasks. However,
the action accuracy of these models on complex downstream tasks is
unsatisfactory. One important reason is that these models rely solely on the
post-training paradigm of imitation learning, which makes it difficult to have
a deeper understanding of the distribution properties of data quality, which is
exactly what Reinforcement Learning (RL) excels at. In this paper, we
theoretically propose an offline RL post-training objective for VLA flow models
and induce an efficient and feasible offline RL fine-tuning algorithm --
Adaptive Reinforced Flow Matching (ARFM). By introducing an adaptively adjusted
scaling factor in the VLA flow model loss, we construct a principled
bias-variance trade-off objective function to optimally control the impact of
RL signal on flow loss. ARFM adaptively balances RL advantage preservation and
flow loss gradient variance control, resulting in a more stable and efficient
fine-tuning process. Extensive simulation and real-world experimental results
show that ARFM exhibits excellent generalization, robustness, few-shot
learning, and continuous learning performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04063v1,,False
TensoIS: A Step Towards Feed-Forward Tensorial Inverse Subsurface Scattering for Perlin Distributed Heterogeneous Media,04/09/2025,"Ashish Tiwari, Satyam Bhardwaj, Yash Bachwana, Parag Sarvoday Sahu, T. M. Feroz Ali, Bhargava Chintalapati, Shanmuganathan Raman","Estimating scattering parameters of heterogeneous media from images is a
severely under-constrained and challenging problem. Most of the existing
approaches model BSSRDF either through an analysis-by-synthesis approach,
approximating complex path integrals, or using differentiable volume rendering
techniques to account for heterogeneity. However, only a few studies have
applied learning-based methods to estimate subsurface scattering parameters,
but they assume homogeneous media. Interestingly, no specific distribution is
known to us that can explicitly model the heterogeneous scattering parameters
in the real world. Notably, procedural noise models such as Perlin and Fractal
Perlin noise have been effective in representing intricate heterogeneities of
natural, organic, and inorganic surfaces. Leveraging this, we first create
HeteroSynth, a synthetic dataset comprising photorealistic images of
heterogeneous media whose scattering parameters are modeled using Fractal
Perlin noise. Furthermore, we propose Tensorial Inverse Scattering (TensoIS), a
learning-based feed-forward framework to estimate these Perlin-distributed
heterogeneous scattering parameters from sparse multi-view image observations.
Instead of directly predicting the 3D scattering parameter volume, TensoIS uses
learnable low-rank tensor components to represent the scattering volume. We
evaluate TensoIS on unseen heterogeneous variations over shapes from the
HeteroSynth test set, smoke and cloud geometries obtained from open-source
realistic volumetric simulations, and some real-world samples to establish its
effectiveness for inverse scattering. Overall, this study is an attempt to
explore Perlin noise distribution, given the lack of any such well-defined
distribution in literature, to potentially model real-world heterogeneous
scattering in a feed-forward manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04047v1,,False
LMAE4Eth: Generalizable and Robust Ethereum Fraud Detection by Exploring Transaction Semantics and Masked Graph Embedding,04/09/2025,"Yifan Jia, Yanbin Wang, Jianguo Sun, Ye Tian, Peng Qian","Current Ethereum fraud detection methods rely on context-independent,
numerical transaction sequences, failing to capture semantic of account
transactions. Furthermore, the pervasive homogeneity in Ethereum transaction
records renders it challenging to learn discriminative account embeddings.
Moreover, current self-supervised graph learning methods primarily learn node
representations through graph reconstruction, resulting in suboptimal
performance for node-level tasks like fraud account detection, while these
methods also encounter scalability challenges. To tackle these challenges, we
propose LMAE4Eth, a multi-view learning framework that fuses transaction
semantics, masked graph embedding, and expert knowledge. We first propose a
transaction-token contrastive language model (TxCLM) that transforms
context-independent numerical transaction records into logically cohesive
linguistic representations. To clearly characterize the semantic differences
between accounts, we also use a token-aware contrastive learning pre-training
objective together with the masked transaction model pre-training objective,
learns high-expressive account representations. We then propose a masked
account graph autoencoder (MAGAE) using generative self-supervised learning,
which achieves superior node-level account detection by focusing on
reconstructing account node features. To enable MAGAE to scale for large-scale
training, we propose to integrate layer-neighbor sampling into the graph, which
reduces the number of sampled vertices by several times without compromising
training quality. Finally, using a cross-attention fusion network, we unify the
embeddings of TxCLM and MAGAE to leverage the benefits of both. We evaluate our
method against 21 baseline approaches on three datasets. Experimental results
show that our method outperforms the best baseline by over 10% in F1-score on
two of the datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03939v1,,False
SelfAug: Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Retrieval-Augmented Generation via Distribution Self-Alignment,04/09/2025,"Yuqing Huang, Rongyang Zhang, Qimeng Wang, Chengqiang Lu, Yan Gao, Yi Wu, Yao Hu, Xuyang Zhi, Guiquan Liu, Xin Li, Hao Wang, Enhong Chen","Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized
natural language processing through their remarkable capabilities in
understanding and executing diverse tasks. While supervised fine-tuning,
particularly in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) scenarios, effectively
enhances task-specific performance, it often leads to catastrophic forgetting,
where models lose their previously acquired knowledge and general capabilities.
Existing solutions either require access to general instruction data or face
limitations in preserving the model's original distribution. To overcome these
limitations, we propose SelfAug, a self-distribution alignment method that
aligns input sequence logits to preserve the model's semantic distribution,
thereby mitigating catastrophic forgetting and improving downstream
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SelfAug achieves a superior
balance between downstream learning and general capability retention. Our
comprehensive empirical analysis reveals a direct correlation between
distribution shifts and the severity of catastrophic forgetting in RAG
scenarios, highlighting how the absence of RAG capabilities in general
instruction tuning leads to significant distribution shifts during fine-tuning.
Our findings not only advance the understanding of catastrophic forgetting in
RAG contexts but also provide a practical solution applicable across diverse
fine-tuning scenarios. Our code is publicly available at

An invertible generative model for forward and inverse problems,04/09/2025,"Tristan van Leeuwen, Christoph Brune, Marcello Carioni","We formulate the inverse problem in a Bayesian framework and aim to train a
generative model that allows us to simulate (i.e., sample from the likelihood)
and do inference (i.e., sample from the posterior). We review the use of
triangular normalizing flows for conditional sampling in this context and show
how to combine two such triangular maps (an upper and a lower one) in to one
invertible mapping that can be used for simulation and inference. We work out
several useful properties of this invertible generative model and propose a
possible training loss for training the map directly. We illustrate the
workings of this new approach to conditional generative modeling numerically on
a few stylized examples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03910v1,,False
"Diffusion Generative Models Meet Compressed Sensing, with Applications to Image Data and Financial Time Series",04/09/2025,"Zhengyi Guo, Jiatu Li, Wenpin Tang, David D. Yao","This paper develops dimension reduction techniques for accelerating diffusion
model inference in the context of synthetic data generation. The idea is to
integrate compressed sensing into diffusion models: (i) compress the data into
a latent space, (ii) train a diffusion model in the latent space, and (iii)
apply a compressed sensing algorithm to the samples generated in the latent
space, facilitating the efficiency of both model training and inference. Under
suitable sparsity assumptions on data, the proposed algorithm is proved to
enjoy faster convergence by combining diffusion model inference with sparse
recovery. As a byproduct, we obtain an optimal value for the latent space
dimension. We also conduct numerical experiments on a range of datasets,
including image data (handwritten digits, medical images, and climate data) and
financial time series for stress testing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03898v1,,False
Reactive In-Air Clothing Manipulation with Confidence-Aware Dense Correspondence and Visuotactile Affordance,04/09/2025,"Neha Sunil, Megha Tippur, Arnau Saumell, Edward Adelson, Alberto Rodriguez","Manipulating clothing is challenging due to complex configurations, variable
material dynamics, and frequent self-occlusion. Prior systems often flatten
garments or assume visibility of key features. We present a dual-arm
visuotactile framework that combines confidence-aware dense visual
correspondence and tactile-supervised grasp affordance to operate directly on
crumpled and suspended garments. The correspondence model is trained on a
custom, high-fidelity simulated dataset using a distributional loss that
captures cloth symmetries and generates correspondence confidence estimates.
These estimates guide a reactive state machine that adapts folding strategies
based on perceptual uncertainty. In parallel, a visuotactile grasp affordance
network, self-supervised using high-resolution tactile feedback, determines
which regions are physically graspable. The same tactile classifier is used
during execution for real-time grasp validation. By deferring action in
low-confidence states, the system handles highly occluded table-top and in-air
configurations. We demonstrate our task-agnostic grasp selection module in
folding and hanging tasks. Moreover, our dense descriptors provide a reusable
intermediate representation for other planning modalities, such as extracting
grasp targets from human video demonstrations, paving the way for more
generalizable and scalable garment manipulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03889v1,,False
Continuous Monitoring of Large-Scale Generative AI via Deterministic Knowledge Graph Structures,04/09/2025,"Kishor Datta Gupta, Mohd Ariful Haque, Hasmot Ali, Marufa Kamal, Syed Bahauddin Alam, Mohammad Ashiqur Rahman","Generative AI (GEN AI) models have revolutionized diverse application domains
but present substantial challenges due to reliability concerns, including
hallucinations, semantic drift, and inherent biases. These models typically
operate as black-boxes, complicating transparent and objective evaluation.
Current evaluation methods primarily depend on subjective human assessment,
limiting scalability, transparency, and effectiveness. This research proposes a
systematic methodology using deterministic and Large Language Model
(LLM)-generated Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to continuously monitor and evaluate GEN
AI reliability. We construct two parallel KGs: (i) a deterministic KG built
using explicit rule-based methods, predefined ontologies, domain-specific
dictionaries, and structured entity-relation extraction rules, and (ii) an
LLM-generated KG dynamically derived from real-time textual data streams such
as live news articles. Utilizing real-time news streams ensures authenticity,
mitigates biases from repetitive training, and prevents adaptive LLMs from
bypassing predefined benchmarks through feedback memorization. To quantify
structural deviations and semantic discrepancies, we employ several established
KG metrics, including Instantiated Class Ratio (ICR), Instantiated Property
Ratio (IPR), and Class Instantiation (CI). An automated real-time monitoring
framework continuously computes deviations between deterministic and
LLM-generated KGs. By establishing dynamic anomaly thresholds based on
historical structural metric distributions, our method proactively identifies
and flags significant deviations, thus promptly detecting semantic anomalies or
hallucinations. This structured, metric-driven comparison between deterministic
and dynamically generated KGs delivers a robust and scalable evaluation
framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.03857v1,,False
Simulation-based Inference via Langevin Dynamics with Score Matching,04/09/2025,"Haoyu Jiang, Yuexi Wang, Yun Yang","Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the

Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian
sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with
Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in
such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for
SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an
architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of
log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide

MillGNN: Learning Multi-Scale Lead-Lag Dependencies for Multi-Variate Time Series Forecasting,04/09/2025,"Binqing Wu, Zongjiang Shang, Jianlong Huang, Ling Chen","Multi-variate time series (MTS) forecasting is crucial for various
applications. Existing methods have shown promising results owing to their
strong ability to capture intra- and inter-variate dependencies. However, these
methods often overlook lead-lag dependencies at multiple grouping scales,

grouping scale \underline{l}ead-\underline{l}ag dependencies for MTS
forecasting, which can comprehensively capture lead-lag effects considering

introduces two key innovations: (1) a scale-specific lead-lag graph learning
module that integrates cross-correlation coefficients and dynamic decaying
features derived from real-time inputs and time lags to learn lead-lag
dependencies for each scale, which can model evolving lead-lag dependencies
with statistical interpretability and data-driven flexibility; (2) a
hierarchical lead-lag message passing module that passes lead-lag messages at
multiple grouping scales in a structured way to simultaneously propagate intra-

"Hardware-Aware Data and Instruction Mapping for AI Tasks: Balancing Parallelism, I/O and Memory Tradeoffs",04/09/2025,"Md Rownak Hossain Chowdhury, Mostafizur Rahman","We introduce a mapping framework for deep learning inference that takes
advantage of predictable neural network behavior to plan both computation and
communication ahead of time. The framework generates a unified stream of
instructions and data, enabling the hardware to execute operations and route
information on its own, without frequent involvement from the host and with
minimal off-chip memory use. This naturally reduces reliance on I/O, off-chip
memory, and host control. By leveraging fine-grained message passing on a
programmable, message-based compute architecture, the framework keeps data
movement local and coordinates computation across the array using techniques
such as stationary-weight reuse, in-array multicasting, and staged reductions.
Applied to VGG-19, the framework sustains high utilization (88 to 92 percent),
with over 97 percent of messages generated internally and nearly 89 percent of
time consumed on-chip transfers. Computation throughput scales beyond 1 TFLOP/s

Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Collaborative Spatial Perception via Multimodal Large Language Models,04/09/2025,"Kimia Ehsani, Walid Saad","Accurate prediction of communication link quality metrics is essential for
vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) systems, enabling smooth handovers, efficient
beam management, and reliable low-latency communication. The increasing
availability of sensor data from modern vehicles motivates the use of
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) because of their adaptability across
tasks and reasoning capabilities. However, MLLMs inherently lack
three-dimensional spatial understanding. To overcome this limitation, a
lightweight, plug-and-play bird's-eye view (BEV) injection connector is
proposed. In this framework, a BEV of the environment is constructed by
collecting sensing data from neighboring vehicles. This BEV representation is
then fused with the ego vehicle's input to provide spatial context for the
large language model. To support realistic multimodal learning, a co-simulation
environment combining CARLA simulator and MATLAB-based ray tracing is developed
to generate RGB, LiDAR, GPS, and wireless signal data across varied scenarios.
Instructions and ground-truth responses are programmatically extracted from the
ray-tracing outputs. Extensive experiments are conducted across three V2I link
prediction tasks: line-of-sight (LoS) versus non-line-of-sight (NLoS)
classification, link availability, and blockage prediction. Simulation results
show that the proposed BEV injection framework consistently improved
performance across all tasks. The results indicate that, compared to an
ego-only baseline, the proposed approach improves the macro-average of the
accuracy metrics by up to 13.9%. The results also show that this performance
gain increases by up to 32.7% under challenging rainy and nighttime conditions,

SAMVAD: A Multi-Agent System for Simulating Judicial Deliberation Dynamics in India,04/09/2025,"Prathamesh Devadiga, Omkaar Jayadev Shetty, Pooja Agarwal","Understanding the complexities of judicial deliberation is crucial for
assessing the efficacy and fairness of a justice system. However, empirical
studies of judicial panels are constrained by significant ethical and practical
barriers. This paper introduces SAMVAD, an innovative Multi-Agent System (MAS)

Indian justice system.
  Our system comprises agents representing key judicial roles: a Judge, a
Prosecution Counsel, a Defense Counsel, and multiple Adjudicators (simulating a
judicial bench), all powered by large language models (LLMs). A primary
contribution of this work is the integration of Retrieval-Augmented Generation

documents, including the Indian Penal Code and the Constitution of India. This
RAG functionality enables the Judge and Counsel agents to generate legally
sound instructions and arguments, complete with source citations, thereby
enhancing both the fidelity and transparency of the simulation.
  The Adjudicator agents engage in iterative deliberation rounds, processing
case facts, legal instructions, and arguments to reach a consensus-based
verdict. We detail the system architecture, agent communication protocols, the
RAG pipeline, the simulation workflow, and a comprehensive evaluation plan
designed to assess performance, deliberation quality, and outcome consistency.
  This work provides a configurable and explainable MAS platform for exploring
legal reasoning and group decision-making dynamics in judicial simulations,
