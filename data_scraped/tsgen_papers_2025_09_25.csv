Video models are zero-shot learners and reasoners,24/09/2025,"Thaddäus Wiedemer, Yuxuan Li, Paul Vicol, Shixiang Shane Gu, Nick Matarese, Kevin Swersky, Been Kim, Priyank Jaini, Robert Geirhos","The remarkable zero-shot capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) have
propelled natural language processing from task-specific models to unified,
generalist foundation models. This transformation emerged from simple
primitives: large, generative models trained on web-scale data. Curiously, the
same primitives apply to today's generative video models. Could video models be
on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs
developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can
solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting
objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties,
recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities
to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of
visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving. Veo's emergent zero-shot
capabilities indicate that video models are on a path to becoming unified,
generalist vision foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20328v1,,False
VisualMimic: Visual Humanoid Loco-Manipulation via Motion Tracking and Generation,24/09/2025,"Shaofeng Yin, Yanjie Ze, Hong-Xing Yu, C. Karen Liu, Jiajun Wu","Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight
integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing
approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to
generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real
framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control
for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint
tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with
a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual
and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the
low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics.
VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in
simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of
loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and
kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize
robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at:

Graph Variate Neural Networks,24/09/2025,"Om Roy, Yashar Moshfeghi, Keith Smith","Modelling dynamically evolving spatio-temporal signals is a prominent
challenge in the Graph Neural Network (GNN) literature. Notably, GNNs assume an
existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not
always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving
functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph
Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a
network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support
usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from
graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs):
layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent
connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous,
data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical
interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits
an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across
forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based
baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs
and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong
accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20311v1,,False
Alignment-Sensitive Minimax Rates for Spectral Algorithms with Learned Kernels,24/09/2025,"Dongming Huang, Zhifan Li, Yicheng Li, Qian Lin","We study spectral algorithms in the setting where kernels are learned from
data. We introduce the effective span dimension (ESD), an alignment-sensitive
complexity measure that depends jointly on the signal, spectrum, and noise
level $\sigma^2$. The ESD is well-defined for arbitrary kernels and signals
without requiring eigen-decay conditions or source conditions. We prove that
for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as
$\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and
prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between
adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of
spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by
extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory
with numerical experiments. This framework provides a novel perspective on
generalization beyond traditional fixed-kernel theories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20294v1,,False
Error Propagation in Dynamic Programming: From Stochastic Control to Option Pricing,24/09/2025,"Andrea Della Vecchia, Damir Filipović","This paper investigates theoretical and methodological foundations for
stochastic optimal control (SOC) in discrete time. We start formulating the
control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the
mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The
associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations
combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The
regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs),
exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are
introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our
value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and
rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze
how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a
relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate
how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing
of American options.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20239v1,,False
The Cream Rises to the Top: Efficient Reranking Method for Verilog Code Generation,24/09/2025,"Guang Yang, Wei Zheng, Xiang Chen, Yifan Sun, Fengji Zhang, Terry Yue Zhuo","LLMs face significant challenges in Verilog generation due to limited
domain-specific knowledge. While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics,
hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain
candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem
between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a
discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking.
Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling
expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case
generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the
above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids
computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20215v1,,False
An Improved Time Series Anomaly Detection by Applying Structural Similarity,24/09/2025,"Tiejun Wang, Rui Wang, Xudong Mou, Mengyuan Ma, Tianyu Wo, Renyu Yang, Xudong Liu","Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial
applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and
the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches
have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection
remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of
reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures,
ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus
failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose
StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the
optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the
time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture
such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape
in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent
structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time
series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can
assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in
terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation
and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any
reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both
point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that
StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models
across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20184v1,,False
"Affective Computing and Emotional Data: Challenges and Implications in Privacy Regulations, The AI Act, and Ethics in Large Language Models",24/09/2025,Nicola Fabiano,"This paper examines the integration of emotional intelligence into artificial
intelligence systems, with a focus on affective computing and the growing
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Claude, to
recognize and respond to human emotions. Drawing on interdisciplinary research
that combines computer science, psychology, and neuroscience, the study
analyzes foundational neural architectures - CNNs for processing facial
expressions and RNNs for sequential data, such as speech and text - that enable
emotion recognition. It examines the transformation of human emotional
experiences into structured emotional data, addressing the distinction between
explicit emotional data collected with informed consent in research settings
and implicit data gathered passively through everyday digital interactions.
That raises critical concerns about lawful processing, AI transparency, and
individual autonomy over emotional expressions in digital environments. The
paper explores implications across various domains, including healthcare,
education, and customer service, while addressing challenges of cultural
variations in emotional expression and potential biases in emotion recognition
systems across different demographic groups. From a regulatory perspective, the
paper examines emotional data in the context of the GDPR and the EU AI Act
frameworks, highlighting how emotional data may be considered sensitive
personal data that requires robust safeguards, including purpose limitation,
data minimization, and meaningful consent mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20153v1,,False
Probability Signature: Bridging Data Semantics and Embedding Structure in Language Models,24/09/2025,"Junjie Yao, Zhi-Qin John Xu","The embedding space of language models is widely believed to capture the
semantic relationships; for instance, embeddings of digits often exhibit an
ordered structure that corresponds to their natural sequence. However, the
mechanisms driving the formation of such structures remain poorly understood.
In this work, we interpret the embedding structures via the data distribution.
We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic
relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks
using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical
analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures
significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our
analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture
on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability
signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly
in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings. Our work uncovers
the mechanism of how data distribution guides the formation of embedding
structures, establishing a novel understanding of the relationship between
embedding organization and semantic patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20124v1,,False
Discrete Diffusion for Reflective Vision-Language-Action Models in Autonomous Driving,24/09/2025,"Pengxiang Li, Yinan Zheng, Yue Wang, Huimin Wang, Hang Zhao, Jingjing Liu, Xianyuan Zhan, Kun Zhan, Xianpeng Lang","End-to-End (E2E) solutions have emerged as a mainstream approach for
autonomous driving systems, with Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models
representing a new paradigm that leverages pre-trained multimodal knowledge
from Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to interpret and interact with complex
real-world environments. However, these methods remain constrained by the
limitations of imitation learning, which struggles to inherently encode
physical rules during training. Existing approaches often rely on complex
rule-based post-refinement, employ reinforcement learning that remains largely
limited to simulation, or utilize diffusion guidance that requires
computationally expensive gradient calculations. To address these challenges,
we introduce ReflectDrive, a novel learning-based framework that integrates a
reflection mechanism for safe trajectory generation via discrete diffusion. We
first discretize the two-dimensional driving space to construct an action
codebook, enabling the use of pre-trained Diffusion Language Models for
planning tasks through fine-tuning. Central to our approach is a safety-aware
reflection mechanism that performs iterative self-correction without gradient
computation. Our method begins with goal-conditioned trajectory generation to
model multi-modal driving behaviors. Based on this, we apply local search
methods to identify unsafe tokens and determine feasible solutions, which then
serve as safe anchors for inpainting-based regeneration. Evaluated on the
NAVSIM benchmark, ReflectDrive demonstrates significant advantages in
safety-critical trajectory generation, offering a scalable and reliable
solution for autonomous driving systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20109v1,,False
CoMelSinger: Discrete Token-Based Zero-Shot Singing Synthesis With Structured Melody Control and Guidance,24/09/2025,"Junchuan Zhao, Wei Zeng, Tianle Lyu, Ye Wang","Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) aims to generate expressive vocal performances
from structured musical inputs such as lyrics and pitch sequences. While recent
progress in discrete codec-based speech synthesis has enabled zero-shot
generation via in-context learning, directly extending these techniques to SVS
remains non-trivial due to the requirement for precise melody control. In
particular, prompt-based generation often introduces prosody leakage, where
pitch information is inadvertently entangled within the timbre prompt,
compromising controllability. We present CoMelSinger, a zero-shot SVS framework
that enables structured and disentangled melody control within a discrete codec
modeling paradigm. Built on the non-autoregressive MaskGCT architecture,
CoMelSinger replaces conventional text inputs with lyric and pitch tokens,
preserving in-context generalization while enhancing melody conditioning. To
suppress prosody leakage, we propose a coarse-to-fine contrastive learning
strategy that explicitly regularizes pitch redundancy between the acoustic
prompt and melody input. Furthermore, we incorporate a lightweight encoder-only
Singing Voice Transcription (SVT) module to align acoustic tokens with pitch
and duration, offering fine-grained frame-level supervision. Experimental
results demonstrate that CoMelSinger achieves notable improvements in pitch
accuracy, timbre consistency, and zero-shot transferability over competitive
baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19883v1,,False
Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning for Contact-Rich Manipulation Tasks,24/09/2025,"Noah Geiger, Tamim Asfour, Neville Hogan, Johannes Lachner","Learning methods excel at motion generation in the information domain but are
not primarily designed for physical interaction in the energy domain. Impedance
Control shapes physical interaction but requires task-aware tuning by selecting
feasible impedance parameters. We present Diffusion-Based Impedance Learning, a
framework that combines both domains. A Transformer-based Diffusion Model with
cross-attention to external wrenches reconstructs a simulated Zero-Force
Trajectory (sZFT). This captures both translational and rotational task-space
behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise
scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then
passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping
parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task
axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were
collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using
teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples,
the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational
accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and
autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot. The controller
achieved smooth parkour traversal within force and velocity limits and 30/30
success rates for cylindrical, square, and star peg insertions without any
peg-specific demonstrations in the training data set. All code for the
Transformer-based Diffusion Model, the robot controller, and the Apple Vision
Pro telemanipulation framework is publicly available. These results mark an
important step towards Physical AI, fusing model-based control for physical
interaction with learning-based methods for trajectory generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19696v1,,False
Formal Safety Verification and Refinement for Generative Motion Planners via Certified Local Stabilization,24/09/2025,"Devesh Nath, Haoran Yin, Glen Chou","We present a method for formal safety verification of learning-based
generative motion planners. Generative motion planners (GMPs) offer advantages
over traditional planners, but verifying the safety and dynamic feasibility of
their outputs is difficult since neural network verification (NNV) tools scale
only to a few hundred neurons, while GMPs often contain millions. To preserve
GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate
the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural
tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This
yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the
controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a
library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that
imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving
safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including
diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in
simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware
(differential-drive robot).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19688v1,,False
Long-Range Dependence in Financial Markets: Empirical Evidence and Generative Modeling Challenges,24/09/2025,"Yifan He, Svetlozar Rachev","This study presents a comprehensive empirical investigation of the presence
of long-range dependence (LRD) in the dynamics of major U.S. stock market
indexes--S\&P 500, Dow Jones, and Nasdaq--at daily, weekly, and monthly
frequencies. We employ three distinct methods: the classical rescaled range
(R/S) analysis, the more robust detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA), and a
sophisticated ARFIMA--FIGARCH model with Student's $t$-distributed innovations.
Our results confirm the presence of LRD, primarily driven by long memory in
volatility rather than in the mean returns. Building on these findings, we
explore the capability of a modern deep learning approach, Quant generative
adversarial networks (GANs), to learn and replicate the LRD observed in the
empirical data. While Quant GANs effectively capture heavy-tailed distributions
and some aspects of volatility clustering, they suffer from significant
limitations in reproducing the LRD, particularly at higher frequencies. This
work highlights the challenges and opportunities in using data-driven models
for generating realistic financial time series that preserve complex temporal
dependencies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19663v1,,False
