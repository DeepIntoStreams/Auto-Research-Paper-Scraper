Ensemble Modeling of Multiple Physical Indicators to Dynamically Phenotype Autism Spectrum Disorder,23/08/2024,"Marie Huynh, Aaron Kline, Saimourya Surabhi, Kaitlyn Dunlap, Onur Cezmi Mutlu, Mohammadmahdi Honarmand, Parnian Azizian, Peter Washington, Dennis P. Wall","Early detection of autism, a neurodevelopmental disorder marked by social
communication challenges, is crucial for timely intervention. Recent
advancements have utilized naturalistic home videos captured via the mobile
application GuessWhat. Through interactive games played between children and
their guardians, GuessWhat has amassed over 3,000 structured videos from 382
children, both diagnosed with and without Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This
collection provides a robust dataset for training computer vision models to
detect ASD-related phenotypic markers, including variations in emotional
expression, eye contact, and head movements. We have developed a protocol to
curate high-quality videos from this dataset, forming a comprehensive training
set. Utilizing this set, we trained individual LSTM-based models using eye
gaze, head positions, and facial landmarks as input features, achieving test
AUCs of 86%, 67%, and 78%, respectively. To boost diagnostic accuracy, we
applied late fusion techniques to create ensemble models, improving the overall
AUC to 90%. This approach also yielded more equitable results across different
genders and age groups. Our methodology offers a significant step forward in
the early detection of ASD by potentially reducing the reliance on subjective
assessments and making early identification more accessibly and equitable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13255v1,,False
Amortized Bayesian Multilevel Models,23/08/2024,"Daniel Habermann, Marvin Schmitt, Lars Kühmichel, Andreas Bulling, Stefan T. Radev, Paul-Christian Bürkner","Multilevel models (MLMs) are a central building block of the Bayesian
workflow. They enable joint, interpretable modeling of data across hierarchical
levels and provide a fully probabilistic quantification of uncertainty. Despite
their well-recognized advantages, MLMs pose significant computational
challenges, often rendering their estimation and evaluation intractable within
reasonable time constraints. Recent advances in simulation-based inference
offer promising solutions for addressing complex probabilistic models using
deep generative networks. However, the utility and reliability of deep learning
methods for estimating Bayesian MLMs remains largely unexplored, especially
when compared with gold-standard samplers. To this end, we explore a family of
neural network architectures that leverage the probabilistic factorization of
multilevel models to facilitate efficient neural network training and
subsequent near-instant posterior inference on unseen data sets. We test our
method on several real-world case studies and provide comprehensive comparisons
to Stan as a gold-standard method where possible. Finally, we provide an
open-source implementation of our methods to stimulate further research in the
nascent field of amortized Bayesian inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13230v1,,False
EUR-USD Exchange Rate Forecasting Based on Information Fusion with Large Language Models and Deep Learning Methods,23/08/2024,"Hongcheng Ding, Xuanze Zhao, Zixiao Jiang, Shamsul Nahar Abdullah, Deshinta Arrova Dewi","Accurate forecasting of the EUR/USD exchange rate is crucial for investors,
businesses, and policymakers. This paper proposes a novel framework, IUS, that
integrates unstructured textual data from news and analysis with structured
data on exchange rates and financial indicators to enhance exchange rate
prediction. The IUS framework employs large language models for sentiment
polarity scoring and exchange rate movement classification of texts. These
textual features are combined with quantitative features and input into a
Causality-Driven Feature Generator. An Optuna-optimized Bi-LSTM model is then
used to forecast the EUR/USD exchange rate. Experiments demonstrate that the
proposed method outperforms benchmark models, reducing MAE by 10.69% and RMSE
by 9.56% compared to the best performing baseline. Results also show the
benefits of data fusion, with the combination of unstructured and structured
data yielding higher accuracy than structured data alone. Furthermore, feature
selection using the top 12 important quantitative features combined with the
textual features proves most effective. The proposed IUS framework and
Optuna-Bi-LSTM model provide a powerful new approach for exchange rate
forecasting through multi-source data integration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13214v1,,False
A density ratio framework for evaluating the utility of synthetic data,23/08/2024,"Thom Benjamin Volker, Peter-Paul de Wolf, Erik-Jan van Kesteren","Synthetic data generation is a promising technique to facilitate the use of
sensitive data while mitigating the risk of privacy breaches. However, for
synthetic data to be useful in downstream analysis tasks, it needs to be of
sufficient quality. Various methods have been proposed to measure the utility
of synthetic data, but their results are often incomplete or even misleading.
In this paper, we propose using density ratio estimation to improve quality
evaluation for synthetic data, and thereby the quality of synthesized datasets.
We show how this framework relates to and builds on existing measures, yielding
global and local utility measures that are informative and easy to interpret.
We develop an estimator which requires little to no manual tuning due to
automatic selection of a nonparametric density ratio model. Through
simulations, we find that density ratio estimation yields more accurate
estimates of global utility than established procedures. A real-world data
application demonstrates how the density ratio can guide refinements of
synthesis models and can be used to improve downstream analyses. We conclude
that density ratio estimation is a valuable tool in synthetic data generation
workflows and provide these methods in the accessible open source R-package
densityratio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13167v1,,False
Diffusion-based Episodes Augmentation for Offline Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning,23/08/2024,"Jihwan Oh, Sungnyun Kim, Gahee Kim, Sunghwan Kim, Se-Young Yun","Offline multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) is increasingly recognized
as crucial for effectively deploying RL algorithms in environments where
real-time interaction is impractical, risky, or costly. In the offline setting,
learning from a static dataset of past interactions allows for the development
of robust and safe policies without the need for live data collection, which
can be fraught with challenges. Building on this foundational importance, we
present EAQ, Episodes Augmentation guided by Q-total loss, a novel approach for
offline MARL framework utilizing diffusion models. EAQ integrates the Q-total
function directly into the diffusion model as a guidance to maximize the global
returns in an episode, eliminating the need for separate training. Our focus
primarily lies on cooperative scenarios, where agents are required to act
collectively towards achieving a shared goal-essentially, maximizing global
returns. Consequently, we demonstrate that our episodes augmentation in a
collaborative manner significantly boosts offline MARL algorithm compared to
the original dataset, improving the normalized return by +17.3% and +12.9% for
medium and poor behavioral policies in SMAC simulator, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13092v1,,False
Hierarchical Spatio-Temporal State-Space Modeling for fMRI Analysis,23/08/2024,"Yuxiang Wei, Anees Abrol, Reihaneh Hassanzadeh, Vince Calhoun","Recent advances in deep learning structured state space models, especially
the Mamba architecture, have demonstrated remarkable performance improvements
while maintaining linear complexity. In this study, we introduce functional
spatiotemporal Mamba (FST-Mamba), a Mamba-based model designed for discovering
neurological biomarkers using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We
focus on dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) derived from fMRI and
propose a hierarchical spatiotemporal Mamba-based network that processes
spatial and temporal information separately using Mamba-based encoders.
Leveraging the topological uniqueness of the FNC matrix, we introduce a
component-wise varied-scale aggregation (CVA) mechanism to aggregate
connectivity across individual components within brain networks, enabling the
model to capture both inter-component and inter-network information. To better
handle the FNC data, we develop a new component-specific scanning order.
Additionally, we propose symmetric rotary position encoding (SymRope) to encode
the relative positions of each functional connection while considering the
symmetric nature of the FNC matrix. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in the proposed FST-Mamba model on various brain-based
classification and regression tasks. Our work reveals the substantial potential
of attention-free sequence modeling in brain discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13074v1,,False
cc-DRL: a Convex Combined Deep Reinforcement Learning Flight Control Design for a Morphing Quadrotor,23/08/2024,"Tao Yang, Huai-Ning Wu, Jun-Wei Wang","In comparison to common quadrotors, the shape change of morphing quadrotors
endows it with a more better flight performance but also results in more
complex flight dynamics. Generally, it is extremely difficult or even
impossible for morphing quadrotors to establish an accurate mathematical model
describing their complex flight dynamics. To figure out the issue of flight
control design for morphing quadrotors, this paper resorts to a combination of
model-free control techniques (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, DRL) and
convex combination (CC) technique, and proposes a convex-combined-DRL (cc-DRL)
flight control algorithm for position and attitude of a class of morphing
quadrotors, where the shape change is realized by the length variation of four
arm rods. In the proposed cc-DRL flight control algorithm, proximal policy
optimization algorithm that is a model-free DRL algorithm is utilized to
off-line train the corresponding optimal flight control laws for some selected
representative arm length modes and hereby a cc-DRL flight control scheme is
constructed by the convex combination technique. Finally, simulation results
are presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed flight
control algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13054v1,,False
SpeechPrompt: Prompting Speech Language Models for Speech Processing Tasks,23/08/2024,"Kai-Wei Chang, Haibin Wu, Yu-Kai Wang, Yuan-Kuei Wu, Hua Shen, Wei-Cheng Tseng, Iu-thing Kang, Shang-Wen Li, Hung-yi Lee","Prompting has become a practical method for utilizing pre-trained language
models (LMs). This approach offers several advantages. It allows an LM to adapt
to new tasks with minimal training and parameter updates, thus achieving
efficiency in both storage and computation. Additionally, prompting modifies
only the LM's inputs and harnesses the generative capabilities of language
models to address various downstream tasks in a unified manner. This
significantly reduces the need for human labor in designing task-specific
models. These advantages become even more evident as the number of tasks served
by the LM scales up. Motivated by the strengths of prompting, we are the first
to explore the potential of prompting speech LMs in the domain of speech
processing. Recently, there has been a growing interest in converting speech
into discrete units for language modeling. Our pioneer research demonstrates
that these quantized speech units are highly versatile within our unified
prompting framework. Not only can they serve as class labels, but they also
contain rich phonetic information that can be re-synthesized back into speech
signals for speech generation tasks. Specifically, we reformulate speech
processing tasks into speech-to-unit generation tasks. As a result, we can
seamlessly integrate tasks such as speech classification, sequence generation,
and speech generation within a single, unified prompting framework. The
experiment results show that the prompting method can achieve competitive
performance compared to the strong fine-tuning method based on self-supervised
learning models with a similar number of trainable parameters. The prompting
method also shows promising results in the few-shot setting. Moreover, with the
advanced speech LMs coming into the stage, the proposed prompting framework
attains great potential.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13040v1,10.1109/TASLP.2024.3436618,False
Focused Discriminative Training For Streaming CTC-Trained Automatic Speech Recognition Models,23/08/2024,"Adnan Haider, Xingyu Na, Erik McDermott, Tim Ng, Zhen Huang, Xiaodan Zhuang","This paper introduces a novel training framework called Focused
Discriminative Training (FDT) to further improve streaming word-piece
end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) models trained using either
CTC or an interpolation of CTC and attention-based encoder-decoder (AED) loss.
The proposed approach presents a novel framework to identify and improve a
model's recognition on challenging segments of an audio. Notably, this training
framework is independent of hidden Markov models (HMMs) and lattices,
eliminating the need for substantial decision-making regarding HMM topology,
lexicon, and graph generation, as typically required in standard discriminative
training approaches. Compared to additional fine-tuning with MMI or MWER loss
on the encoder, FDT is shown to be more effective in achieving greater
reductions in Word Error Rate (WER) on streaming models trained on LibriSpeech.
Additionally, this method is shown to be effective in further improving a
converged word-piece streaming E2E model trained on 600k hours of assistant and
dictation dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13008v1,,False
Optimal OnTheFly Feedback Control of Event Sensors,23/08/2024,"Valery Vishnevskiy, Greg Burman, Sebastian Kozerke, Diederik Paul Moeys","Event-based vision sensors produce an asynchronous stream of events which are
triggered when the pixel intensity variation exceeds a predefined threshold.
Such sensors offer significant advantages, including reduced data redundancy,
micro-second temporal resolution, and low power consumption, making them
valuable for applications in robotics and computer vision. In this work, we
consider the problem of video reconstruction from events, and propose an
approach for dynamic feedback control of activation thresholds, in which a
controller network analyzes the past emitted events and predicts the optimal
distribution of activation thresholds for the following time segment.
Additionally, we allow a user-defined target peak-event-rate for which the
control network is conditioned and optimized to predict per-column activation
thresholds that would eventually produce the best possible video
reconstruction. The proposed OnTheFly control scheme is data-driven and trained
in an end-to-end fashion using probabilistic relaxation of the discrete event
representation. We demonstrate that our approach outperforms both fixed and
randomly-varying threshold schemes by 6-12% in terms of LPIPS perceptual image
dissimilarity metric, and by 49% in terms of event rate, achieving superior
reconstruction quality while enabling a fine-tuned balance between performance
accuracy and the event rate. Additionally, we show that sampling strategies
provided by our OnTheFly control are interpretable and reflect the
characteristics of the scene. Our results, derived from a physically-accurate
simulator, underline the promise of the proposed methodology in enhancing the
utility of event cameras for image reconstruction and other downstream tasks,
paving the way for hardware implementation of dynamic feedback EVS control in
silicon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12976v1,,False
Data-Driven Parametrization of Molecular Mechanics Force Fields for Expansive Chemical Space Coverage,23/08/2024,"Tianze Zheng, Ailun Wang, Xu Han, Yu Xia, Xingyuan Xu, Jiawei Zhan, Yu Liu, Yang Chen, Zhi Wang, Xiaojie Wu, Sheng Gong, Wen Yan","A force field is a critical component in molecular dynamics simulations for
computational drug discovery. It must achieve high accuracy within the
constraints of molecular mechanics' (MM) limited functional forms, which offers
high computational efficiency. With the rapid expansion of synthetically
accessible chemical space, traditional look-up table approaches face
significant challenges. In this study, we address this issue using a modern
data-driven approach, developing ByteFF, an Amber-compatible force field for
drug-like molecules. To create ByteFF, we generated an expansive and highly
diverse molecular dataset at the B3LYP-D3(BJ)/DZVP level of theory. This
dataset includes 2.4 million optimized molecular fragment geometries with
analytical Hessian matrices, along with 3.2 million torsion profiles. We then
trained an edge-augmented, symmetry-preserving molecular graph neural network
(GNN) on this dataset, employing a carefully optimized training strategy. Our
model predicts all bonded and non-bonded MM force field parameters for
drug-like molecules simultaneously across a broad chemical space. ByteFF
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark datasets,
excelling in predicting relaxed geometries, torsional energy profiles, and
conformational energies and forces. Its exceptional accuracy and expansive
chemical space coverage make ByteFF a valuable tool for multiple stages of
computational drug discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12817v1,,False
A Safe Self-evolution Algorithm for Autonomous Driving Based on Data-Driven Risk Quantification Model,23/08/2024,"Shuo Yang, Shizhen Li, Yanjun Huang, Hong Chen","Autonomous driving systems with self-evolution capabilities have the
potential to independently evolve in complex and open environments, allowing to
handle more unknown scenarios. However, as a result of the safety-performance
trade-off mechanism of evolutionary algorithms, it is difficult to ensure safe
exploration without sacrificing the improvement ability. This problem is
especially prominent in dynamic traffic scenarios. Therefore, this paper
proposes a safe self-evolution algorithm for autonomous driving based on
data-driven risk quantification model. Specifically, a risk quantification
model based on the attention mechanism is proposed by modeling the way humans
perceive risks during driving, with the idea of achieving safety situation
estimation of the surrounding environment through a data-driven approach. To
prevent the impact of over-conservative safety guarding policies on the
self-evolution capability of the algorithm, a safety-evolutionary
decision-control integration algorithm with adjustable safety limits is
proposed, and the proposed risk quantization model is integrated into it.
Simulation and real-vehicle experiments results illustrate the effectiveness of
the proposed method. The results show that the proposed algorithm can generate
safe and reasonable actions in a variety of complex scenarios and guarantee
safety without losing the evolutionary potential of learning-based autonomous
driving systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12805v1,,False
Robust Predictions with Ambiguous Time Delays: A Bootstrap Strategy,23/08/2024,"Jiajie Wang, Zhiyuan Jerry Lin, Wen Chen","In contemporary data-driven environments, the generation and processing of
multivariate time series data is an omnipresent challenge, often complicated by
time delays between different time series. These delays, originating from a
multitude of sources like varying data transmission dynamics, sensor
interferences, and environmental changes, introduce significant complexities.
Traditional Time Delay Estimation methods, which typically assume a fixed
constant time delay, may not fully capture these variabilities, compromising
the precision of predictive models in diverse settings. To address this issue,
we introduce the Time Series Model Bootstrap (TSMB), a versatile framework
designed to handle potentially varying or even nondeterministic time delays in
time series modeling. Contrary to traditional approaches that hinge on the
assumption of a single, consistent time delay, TSMB adopts a nonparametric
stance, acknowledging and incorporating time delay uncertainties. TSMB
significantly bolsters the performance of models that are trained and make
predictions using this framework, making it highly suitable for a wide range of
dynamic and interconnected data environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12801v1,10.1145/3637528.3671920,False
Event Detection via Probability Density Function Regression,23/08/2024,"Clark Peng, Tolga Dinçer","In the domain of time series analysis, particularly in event detection tasks,
current methodologies predominantly rely on segmentation-based approaches,
which predict the class label for each individual timesteps and use the
changepoints of these labels to detect events. However, these approaches may
not effectively detect the precise onset and offset of events within the data
and suffer from class imbalance problems. This study introduces a generalized
regression-based approach to reframe the time-interval-defined event detection
problem. Inspired by heatmap regression techniques from computer vision, our
approach aims to predict probability densities at event locations rather than
class labels across the entire time series. The primary aim of this approach is
to improve the accuracy of event detection methods, particularly for
long-duration events where identifying the onset and offset is more critical
than classifying individual event states. We demonstrate that regression-based
approaches outperform segmentation-based methods across various
state-of-the-art baseline networks and datasets, offering a more effective
solution for specific event detection tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12792v1,,False
