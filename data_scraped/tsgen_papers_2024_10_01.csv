SpaceMesh: A Continuous Representation for Learning Manifold Surface Meshes,30/09/2024,"Tianchang Shen, Zhaoshuo Li, Marc Law, Matan Atzmon, Sanja Fidler, James Lucas, Jun Gao, Nicholas Sharp","Meshes are ubiquitous in visual computing and simulation, yet most existing
machine learning techniques represent meshes only indirectly, e.g. as the level
set of a scalar field or deformation of a template, or as a disordered triangle
soup lacking local structure. This work presents a scheme to directly generate
manifold, polygonal meshes of complex connectivity as the output of a neural
network. Our key innovation is to define a continuous latent connectivity space
at each mesh vertex, which implies the discrete mesh. In particular, our vertex
embeddings generate cyclic neighbor relationships in a halfedge mesh
representation, which gives a guarantee of edge-manifoldness and the ability to
represent general polygonal meshes. This representation is well-suited to
machine learning and stochastic optimization, without restriction on
connectivity or topology. We first explore the basic properties of this
representation, then use it to fit distributions of meshes from large datasets.
The resulting models generate diverse meshes with tessellation structure
learned from the dataset population, with concise details and high-quality mesh
elements. In applications, this approach not only yields high-quality outputs
from generative models, but also enables directly learning challenging geometry
processing tasks such as mesh repair.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20562v1,10.1145/3680528.3687634,False
Scaling Proprioceptive-Visual Learning with Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers,30/09/2024,"Lirui Wang, Xinlei Chen, Jialiang Zhao, Kaiming He","One of the roadblocks for training generalist robotic models today is
heterogeneity. Previous robot learning methods often collect data to train with
one specific embodiment for one task, which is expensive and prone to
overfitting. This work studies the problem of learning policy representations
through heterogeneous pre-training on robot data across different embodiments
and tasks at scale. We propose Heterogeneous Pre-trained Transformers (HPT),
which pre-train a large, shareable trunk of a policy neural network to learn a
task and embodiment agnostic shared representation. This general architecture
aligns the specific proprioception and vision inputs from distinct embodiments
to a short sequence of tokens and then processes such tokens to map to control
robots for different tasks. Leveraging the recent large-scale multi-embodiment
real-world robotic datasets as well as simulation, deployed robots, and human
video datasets, we investigate pre-training policies across heterogeneity. We
conduct experiments to investigate the scaling behaviors of training
objectives, to the extent of 52 datasets. HPTs outperform several baselines and
enhance the fine-tuned policy performance by over 20% on unseen tasks in
multiple simulator benchmarks and real-world settings. See the project website
(https://liruiw.github.io/hpt/) for code and videos.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20537v1,,False
What Information Contributes to Log-based Anomaly Detection? Insights from a Configurable Transformer-Based Approach,30/09/2024,"Xingfang Wu, Heng Li, Foutse Khomh","Log data are generated from logging statements in the source code, providing
insights into the execution processes of software applications and systems.
State-of-the-art log-based anomaly detection approaches typically leverage deep
learning models to capture the semantic or sequential information in the log
data and detect anomalous runtime behaviors. However, the impacts of these
different types of information are not clear. In addition, existing approaches
have not captured the timestamps in the log data, which can potentially provide
more fine-grained temporal information than sequential information. In this
work, we propose a configurable transformer-based anomaly detection model that
can capture the semantic, sequential, and temporal information in the log data
and allows us to configure the different types of information as the model's
features. Additionally, we train and evaluate the proposed model using log
sequences of different lengths, thus overcoming the constraint of existing
methods that rely on fixed-length or time-windowed log sequences as inputs.
With the proposed model, we conduct a series of experiments with different
combinations of input features to evaluate the roles of different types of
information in anomaly detection. When presented with log sequences of varying
lengths, the model can attain competitive and consistently stable performance
compared to the baselines. The results indicate that the event occurrence
information plays a key role in identifying anomalies, while the impact of the
sequential and temporal information is not significant for anomaly detection in
the studied public datasets. On the other hand, the findings also reveal the
simplicity of the studied public datasets and highlight the importance of
constructing new datasets that contain different types of anomalies to better
evaluate the performance of anomaly detection models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20503v1,,False
Stream-level flow matching from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective,30/09/2024,"Ganchao Wei, Li Ma","Flow matching (FM) is a family of training algorithms for fitting continuous
normalizing flows (CNFs). A standard approach to FM, called conditional flow
matching (CFM), exploits the fact that the marginal vector field of a CNF can
be learned by fitting least-square regression to the so-called conditional
vector field specified given one or both ends of the flow path. We show that
viewing CFM training from a Bayesian decision theoretic perspective on
parameter estimation opens the door to generalizations of CFM algorithms. We
propose one such extension by introducing a CFM algorithm based on defining
conditional probability paths given what we refer to as ``streams'', instances
of latent stochastic paths that connect pairs of noise and observed data.
Further, we advocates the modeling of these latent streams using Gaussian
processes (GPs). The unique distributional properties of GPs, and in particular
the fact that the velocities of a GP is still a GP, allows drawing samples from
the resulting stream-augmented conditional probability path without simulating
the actual streams, and hence the ``simulation-free"" nature of CFM training is
preserved. We show that this generalization of the CFM can substantially reduce
the variance in the estimated marginal vector field at a moderate computational
cost, thereby improving the quality of the generated samples under common
metrics. Additionally, we show that adopting the GP on the streams allows for
flexibly linking multiple related training data points (e.g., time series) and
incorporating additional prior information. We empirically validate our claim
through both simulations and applications to two hand-written image datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20423v1,,False
A SSM is Polymerized from Multivariate Time Series,30/09/2024,Haixiang Wu,"For multivariate time series (MTS) tasks, previous state space models (SSMs)
followed the modeling paradigm of Transformer-based methods. However, none of
them explicitly model the complex dependencies of MTS: the Channel Dependency
variations with Time (CDT). In view of this, we delve into the derivation of
SSM, which involves approximating continuously updated functions by orthogonal
function bases. We then develop Poly-Mamba, a novel method for MTS forecasting.
Its core concept is to expand the original orthogonal function basis space into
a multivariate orthogonal function space containing variable mixing terms, and
make a projection on this space so as to explicitly describe the CDT by
weighted coefficients. In Poly-Mamba, we propose the Multivariate Orthogonal
Polynomial Approximation (MOPA) as a simplified implementation of this concept.
For the simple linear relationship between channels, we propose Linear Channel
Mixing (LCM) and generate CDT patterns adaptively for different channels
through a proposed Order Combining method. Experiments on six real-world
datasets demonstrate that Poly-Mamba outperforms the SOTA methods, especially
when dealing with datasets having a large number of channels and complex
correlations. The codes and log files will be released at:

PersonalLLM: Tailoring LLMs to Individual Preferences,30/09/2024,"Thomas P. Zollo, Andrew Wei Tung Siah, Naimeng Ye, Ang Li, Hongseok Namkoong","As LLMs become capable of complex tasks, there is growing potential for
personalized interactions tailored to the subtle and idiosyncratic preferences
of the user. We present a public benchmark, PersonalLLM, focusing on adapting
LLMs to provide maximal benefits for a particular user. Departing from existing
alignment benchmarks that implicitly assume uniform preferences, we curate
open-ended prompts paired with many high-quality answers over which users would
be expected to display heterogeneous latent preferences. Instead of
persona-prompting LLMs based on high-level attributes (e.g., user's race or
response length), which yields homogeneous preferences relative to humans, we
develop a method that can simulate a large user base with diverse preferences
from a set of pre-trained reward models. Our dataset and generated
personalities offer an innovative testbed for developing personalization
algorithms that grapple with continual data sparsity--few relevant feedback
from the particular user--by leveraging historical data from other (similar)
users. We explore basic in-context learning and meta-learning baselines to
illustrate the utility of PersonalLLM and highlight the need for future
methodological development. Our dataset is available at

Random Features Outperform Linear Models: Effect of Strong Input-Label Correlation in Spiked Covariance Data,30/09/2024,"Samet Demir, Zafer Dogan","Random Feature Model (RFM) with a nonlinear activation function is
instrumental in understanding training and generalization performance in
high-dimensional learning. While existing research has established an
asymptotic equivalence in performance between the RFM and noisy linear models
under isotropic data assumptions, empirical observations indicate that the RFM
frequently surpasses linear models in practical applications. To address this
gap, we ask, ""When and how does the RFM outperform linear models?"" In practice,
inputs often have additional structures that significantly influence learning.
Therefore, we explore the RFM under anisotropic input data characterized by
spiked covariance in the proportional asymptotic limit, where dimensions
diverge jointly while maintaining finite ratios. Our analysis reveals that a
high correlation between inputs and labels is a critical factor enabling the
RFM to outperform linear models. Moreover, we show that the RFM performs
equivalent to noisy polynomial models, where the polynomial degree depends on
the strength of the correlation between inputs and labels. Our numerical
simulations validate these theoretical insights, confirming the
performance-wise superiority of RFM in scenarios characterized by strong
input-label correlation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20250v1,,False
Beyond Prompts: Dynamic Conversational Benchmarking of Large Language Models,30/09/2024,"David Castillo-Bolado, Joseph Davidson, Finlay Gray, Marek Rosa","We introduce a dynamic benchmarking system for conversational agents that
evaluates their performance through a single, simulated, and lengthy
user$\leftrightarrow$agent interaction. The interaction is a conversation
between the user and agent, where multiple tasks are introduced and then
undertaken concurrently. We context switch regularly to interleave the tasks,
which constructs a realistic testing scenario in which we assess the Long-Term
Memory, Continual Learning, and Information Integration capabilities of the
agents. Results from both proprietary and open-source Large-Language Models
show that LLMs in general perform well on single-task interactions, but they
struggle on the same tasks when they are interleaved. Notably, short-context
LLMs supplemented with an LTM system perform as well as or better than those
with larger contexts. Our benchmark suggests that there are other challenges
for LLMs responding to more natural interactions that contemporary benchmarks
have heretofore not been able to capture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20222v1,,False
Choosing DAG Models Using Markov and Minimal Edge Count in the Absence of Ground Truth,30/09/2024,"Joseph D. Ramsey, Bryan Andrews, Peter Spirtes","We give a novel nonparametric pointwise consistent statistical test (the
Markov Checker) of the Markov condition for directed acyclic graph (DAG) or
completed partially directed acyclic graph (CPDAG) models given a dataset. We
also introduce the Cross-Algorithm Frugality Search (CAFS) for rejecting DAG
models that either do not pass the Markov Checker test or that are not edge
minimal. Edge minimality has been used previously by Raskutti and Uhler as a
nonparametric simplicity criterion, though CAFS readily generalizes to other
simplicity conditions. Reference to the ground truth is not necessary for CAFS,
so it is useful for finding causal structure learning algorithms and tuning
parameter settings that output causal models that are approximately true from a
given data set. We provide a software tool for this analysis that is suitable
for even quite large or dense models, provided a suitably fast pointwise
consistent test of conditional independence is available. In addition, we show
in simulation that the CAFS procedure can pick approximately correct models
without knowing the ground truth.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20187v1,,False
Modelando procesos cognitivos de la lectura natural con GPT-2,30/09/2024,"Bruno Bianchi, Alfredo Umfurer, Juan Esteban Kamienkowski","The advancement of the Natural Language Processing field has enabled the
development of language models with a great capacity for generating text. In
recent years, Neuroscience has been using these models to better understand
cognitive processes. In previous studies, we found that models like Ngrams and
LSTM networks can partially model Predictability when used as a co-variable to
explain readers' eye movements. In the present work, we further this line of
research by using GPT-2 based models. The results show that this architecture
achieves better outcomes than its predecessors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20174v1,,False
MemSim: A Bayesian Simulator for Evaluating Memory of LLM-based Personal Assistants,30/09/2024,"Zeyu Zhang, Quanyu Dai, Luyu Chen, Zeren Jiang, Rui Li, Jieming Zhu, Xu Chen, Yi Xie, Zhenhua Dong, Ji-Rong Wen","LLM-based agents have been widely applied as personal assistants, capable of
memorizing information from user messages and responding to personal queries.
However, there still lacks an objective and automatic evaluation on their
memory capability, largely due to the challenges in constructing reliable
questions and answers (QAs) according to user messages. In this paper, we
propose MemSim, a Bayesian simulator designed to automatically construct
reliable QAs from generated user messages, simultaneously keeping their
diversity and scalability. Specifically, we introduce the Bayesian Relation
Network (BRNet) and a causal generation mechanism to mitigate the impact of LLM
hallucinations on factual information, facilitating the automatic creation of
an evaluation dataset. Based on MemSim, we generate a dataset in the daily-life
scenario, named MemDaily, and conduct extensive experiments to assess the
effectiveness of our approach. We also provide a benchmark for evaluating
different memory mechanisms in LLM-based agents with the MemDaily dataset. To
benefit the research community, we have released our project at

Single-shot reconstruction of three-dimensional morphology of biological cells in digital holographic microscopy using a physics-driven neural network,30/09/2024,"Jihwan Kim, Youngdo Kim, Hyo Seung Lee, Eunseok Seo, Sang Joon Lee","Recent advances in deep learning-based image reconstruction techniques have
led to significant progress in phase retrieval using digital in-line
holographic microscopy (DIHM). However, existing deep learning-based phase
retrieval methods have technical limitations in generalization performance and
three-dimensional (3D) morphology reconstruction from a single-shot hologram of
biological cells. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning model, named
MorpHoloNet, for single-shot reconstruction of 3D morphology by integrating
physics-driven and coordinate-based neural networks. By simulating the optical
diffraction of coherent light through a 3D phase shift distribution, the
proposed MorpHoloNet is optimized by minimizing the loss between the simulated
and input holograms on the sensor plane. Compared to existing DIHM methods that
face challenges with twin image and phase retrieval problems, MorpHoloNet
enables direct reconstruction of 3D complex light field and 3D morphology of a
test sample from its single-shot hologram without requiring multiple
phase-shifted holograms or angle scanning. The performance of the proposed
MorpHoloNet is validated by reconstructing 3D morphologies and refractive index
distributions from synthetic holograms of ellipsoids and experimental holograms
of biological cells. The proposed deep learning model is utilized to
reconstruct spatiotemporal variations in 3D translational and rotational
behaviors and morphological deformations of biological cells from consecutive
single-shot holograms captured using DIHM. MorpHoloNet would pave the way for
advancing label-free, real-time 3D imaging and dynamic analysis of biological
cells under various cellular microenvironments in biomedical and engineering
fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20013v1,,False
Numerically Robust Fixed-Point Smoothing Without State Augmentation,30/09/2024,Nicholas Krämer,"Practical implementations of Gaussian smoothing algorithms have received a
great deal of attention in the last 60 years. However, almost all work focuses
on estimating complete time series (''fixed-interval smoothing'',
$\mathcal{O}(K)$ memory) through variations of the Rauch--Tung--Striebel
smoother, rarely on estimating the initial states (''fixed-point smoothing'',
$\mathcal{O}(1)$ memory). Since fixed-point smoothing is a crucial component of
algorithms for dynamical systems with unknown initial conditions, we close this
gap by introducing a new formulation of a Gaussian fixed-point smoother. In
contrast to prior approaches, our perspective admits a numerically robust
Cholesky-based form (without downdates) and avoids state augmentation, which
would needlessly inflate the state-space model and reduce the numerical
practicality of any fixed-point smoother code. The experiments demonstrate how
a JAX implementation of our algorithm matches the runtime of the fastest
methods and the robustness of the most robust techniques while existing
implementations must always sacrifice one for the other.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20004v1,,False
Task-agnostic Pre-training and Task-guided Fine-tuning for Versatile Diffusion Planner,30/09/2024,"Chenyou Fan, Chenjia Bai, Zhao Shan, Haoran He, Yang Zhang, Zhen Wang","Diffusion models have demonstrated their capabilities in modeling
trajectories of multi-tasks. However, existing multi-task planners or policies
typically rely on task-specific demonstrations via multi-task imitation, or
require task-specific reward labels to facilitate policy optimization via
Reinforcement Learning (RL). To address these challenges, we aim to develop a
versatile diffusion planner that can leverage large-scale inferior data that
contains task-agnostic sub-optimal trajectories, with the ability to fast adapt
to specific tasks. In this paper, we propose \textbf{SODP}, a two-stage
framework that leverages \textbf{S}ub-\textbf{O}ptimal data to learn a
\textbf{D}iffusion \textbf{P}lanner, which is generalizable for various
downstream tasks. Specifically, in the pre-training stage, we train a
foundation diffusion planner that extracts general planning capabilities by
modeling the versatile distribution of multi-task trajectories, which can be
sub-optimal and has wide data coverage. Then for downstream tasks, we adopt
RL-based fine-tuning with task-specific rewards to fast refine the diffusion
planner, which aims to generate action sequences with higher task-specific
returns. Experimental results from multi-task domains including Meta-World and
Adroit demonstrate that SODP outperforms state-of-the-art methods with only a
small amount of data for reward-guided fine-tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19949v1,,False
Classification with a Network of Partially Informative Agents: Enabling Wise Crowds from Individually Myopic Classifiers,30/09/2024,"Tong Yao, Shreyas Sundaram","We consider the problem of classification with a (peer-to-peer) network of
heterogeneous and partially informative agents, each receiving local data
generated by an underlying true class, and equipped with a classifier that can
only distinguish between a subset of the entire set of classes. We propose an
iterative algorithm that uses the posterior probabilities of the local
classifier and recursively updates each agent's local belief on all the
possible classes, based on its local signals and belief information from its
neighbors. We then adopt a novel distributed min-rule to update each agent's
global belief and enable learning of the true class for all agents. We show
that under certain assumptions, the beliefs on the true class converge to one
asymptotically almost surely. We provide the asymptotic convergence rate, and
demonstrate the performance of our algorithm through simulation with image data
and experimented with random forest classifiers and MobileNet.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.19947v1,,False
SWIM: Short-Window CNN Integrated with Mamba for EEG-Based Auditory Spatial Attention Decoding,30/09/2024,"Ziyang Zhang, Andrew Thwaites, Alexandra Woolgar, Brian Moore, Chao Zhang","In complex auditory environments, the human auditory system possesses the
remarkable ability to focus on a specific speaker while disregarding others. In
this study, a new model named SWIM, a short-window convolution neural network
(CNN) integrated with Mamba, is proposed for identifying the locus of auditory
attention (left or right) from electroencephalography (EEG) signals without
relying on speech envelopes. SWIM consists of two parts. The first is a
short-window CNN (SW$_\text{CNN}$), which acts as a short-term EEG feature
extractor and achieves a final accuracy of 84.9% in the leave-one-speaker-out
setup on the widely used KUL dataset. This improvement is due to the use of an
improved CNN structure, data augmentation, multitask training, and model
combination. The second part, Mamba, is a sequence model first applied to
auditory spatial attention decoding to leverage the long-term dependency from
previous SW$_\text{CNN}$ time steps. By joint training SW$_\text{CNN}$ and
Mamba, the proposed SWIM structure uses both short-term and long-term
information and achieves an accuracy of 86.2%, which reduces the classification
errors by a relative 31.0% compared to the previous state-of-the-art result.
