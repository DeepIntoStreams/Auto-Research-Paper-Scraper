MDPO: Overcoming the Training-Inference Divide of Masked Diffusion Language Models,18/08/2025,"Haoyu He, Katrin Renz, Yong Cao, Andreas Geiger","Diffusion language models, as a promising alternative to traditional
autoregressive (AR) models, enable faster generation and richer conditioning on
bidirectional context. However, they suffer from a key discrepancy between
training and inference: during inference, MDLMs progressively reveal the
structure of the generated sequence by producing fewer and fewer masked tokens,
whereas this structure is ignored in training as tokens are masked at random.
Although this discrepancy between training and inference can lead to suboptimal
performance, it has been largely overlooked by previous works, leaving closing
this gap between the two stages an open problem. To address this, we frame the
problem of learning effective denoising trajectories as a sequential
decision-making problem and use the resulting framework to apply reinforcement
learning. We propose a novel Masked Diffusion Policy Optimization (MDPO) to
exploit the Markov property diffusion possesses and explicitly train the model
under the same progressive refining schedule used at inference. MDPO matches
the performance of the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) method with 60x fewer
gradient updates, while achieving average improvements of 9.6% on MATH500 and
54.2% on Countdown over SOTA when trained within the same number of weight
updates. Additionally, we improve the remasking strategy of MDLMs as a plug-in
inference replacement to overcome the limitation that the model cannot refine
tokens flexibly. This simple yet effective training-free strategy, what we
refer to as RCR, consistently improves performance and yields additional gains
when combined with MDPO. Our findings establish great potential for
investigating the discrepancy between pre-training and inference of MDLMs.

Contrastive Representations for Temporal Reasoning,18/08/2025,"Alicja Ziarko, Michal Bortkiewicz, Michal Zawalski, Benjamin Eysenbach, Piotr Milos","In classical AI, perception relies on learning state-based representations,
while planning, which can be thought of as temporal reasoning over action
sequences, is typically achieved through search. We study whether such
reasoning can instead emerge from representations that capture both perceptual
and temporal structure. We show that standard temporal contrastive learning,
despite its popularity, often fails to capture temporal structure due to its
reliance on spurious features. To address this, we introduce Combinatorial
Representations for Temporal Reasoning (CRTR), a method that uses a negative
sampling scheme to provably remove these spurious features and facilitate
temporal reasoning. CRTR achieves strong results on domains with complex
temporal structure, such as Sokoban and Rubik's Cube. In particular, for the
Rubik's Cube, CRTR learns representations that generalize across all initial
states and allow it to solve the puzzle using fewer search steps than BestFS,
though with longer solutions. To our knowledge, this is the first method that
efficiently solves arbitrary Cube states using only learned representations,
without relying on an external search algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13113v1,,False
Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer -- Towards Foundational Digital Twins in Process Industry,18/08/2025,"Michael Mayr, Georgios C. Chasparis","Foundational modelling of multi-dimensional time-series data in industrial
systems presents a central trade-off: channel-dependent (CD) models capture
specific cross-variable dynamics but lack robustness and adaptability as model
layers are commonly bound to the data dimensionality of the tackled use-case,
while channel-independent (CI) models offer generality at the cost of modelling
the explicit interactions crucial for system-level predictive regression tasks.
To resolve this, we propose the Causally-Guided Pairwise Transformer (CGPT), a
novel architecture that integrates a known causal graph as an inductive bias.
The core of CGPT is built around a pairwise modeling paradigm, tackling the
CD/CI conflict by decomposing the multidimensional data into pairs. The model
uses channel-agnostic learnable layers where all parameter dimensions are
independent of the number of variables. CGPT enforces a CD information flow at
the pair-level and CI-like generalization across pairs. This approach
disentangles complex system dynamics and results in a highly flexible
architecture that ensures scalability and any-variate adaptability. We validate
CGPT on a suite of synthetic and real-world industrial datasets on long-term
and one-step forecasting tasks designed to simulate common industrial
complexities. Results demonstrate that CGPT significantly outperforms both CI
and CD baselines in predictive accuracy and shows competitive performance with
end-to-end trained CD models while remaining agnostic to the problem
dimensionality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13111v1,,False
Denoising diffusion models for inverse design of inflatable structures with programmable deformations,18/08/2025,"Sara Karimi, Nikolaos N. Vlassis","Programmable structures are systems whose undeformed geometries and material
property distributions are deliberately designed to achieve prescribed deformed
configurations under specific loading conditions. Inflatable structures are a
prominent example, using internal pressurization to realize large, nonlinear
deformations in applications ranging from soft robotics and deployable
aerospace systems to biomedical devices and adaptive architecture. We present a
generative design framework based on denoising diffusion probabilistic models
(DDPMs) for the inverse design of elastic structures undergoing large,
nonlinear deformations under pressure-driven actuation. The method formulates
the inverse design as a conditional generation task, using geometric
descriptors of target deformed states as inputs and outputting image-based
representations of the undeformed configuration. Representing these
configurations as simple images is achieved by establishing a pre- and
postprocessing pipeline that involves a fixed image processing, simulation
setup, and descriptor extraction methods. Numerical experiments with scalar and
higher-dimensional descriptors show that the framework can quickly produce
diverse undeformed configurations that achieve the desired deformations when
inflated, enabling parallel exploration of viable design candidates while
accommodating complex constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13097v1,,False
Seeing the Many: Exploring Parameter Distributions Conditioned on Features in Surrogates,18/08/2025,"Xiaohan Wang, Zhimin Li, Joshua A. Levine, Matthew Berger","Recently, neural surrogate models have emerged as a compelling alternative to
traditional simulation workflows. This is accomplished by modeling the
underlying function of scientific simulations, removing the need to run
expensive simulations. Beyond just mapping from input parameter to output,
surrogates have also been shown useful for inverse problems: output to input
parameters. Inverse problems can be understood as search, where we aim to find
parameters whose surrogate outputs contain a specified feature. Yet finding
these parameters can be costly, especially for high-dimensional parameter
spaces. Thus, existing surrogate-based solutions primarily focus on finding a
small set of matching parameters, in the process overlooking the broader
picture of plausible parameters. Our work aims to model and visualize the
distribution of possible input parameters that produce a given output feature.
To achieve this goal, we aim to address two challenges: (1) the approximation
error inherent in the surrogate model and (2) forming the parameter
distribution in an interactive manner. We model error via density estimation,
reporting high density only if a given parameter configuration is close to
training parameters, measured both over the input and output space. Our density
estimate is used to form a prior belief on parameters, and when combined with a
likelihood on features, gives us an efficient way to sample plausible parameter
configurations that generate a target output feature. We demonstrate the
usability of our solution through a visualization interface by performing
feature-driven parameter analysis over the input parameter space of three
simulation datasets. Source code is available at

Hierarchical Evaluation Function (HEF): A Multi-Metric Approach for Optimizing Demand Forecasting Models,18/08/2025,"Adolfo González, Víctor Parada","Demand forecasting is essential for strategic planning in competitive
environments, enabling resource optimization and improved responsiveness to
market dynamics. However, multivariate time series modeling faces challenges
due to data complexity, uncertainty, and frequent regime shifts. Traditional
evaluation metrics can introduce biases and limit generalization. This work
compares two custom evaluation functions: FMAE (Focused Mean Absolute Error),
focused on minimizing absolute errors, and HEF (Hierarchical Evaluation
Function), designed to weight global metrics and penalize large deviations.
Experiments were conducted under different data splits (91:9, 80:20, 70:30)
using three optimizers (Grid Search, PSO, Optuna), assessing fit, relative
accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency. Results show that HEF
consistently outperforms FMAE in global metrics (R2, Relative Accuracy, RMSE,
RMSSE), enhancing model robustness and explanatory power. These findings were
confirmed via visualizations and statistical tests. Conversely, FMAE offers
advantages in local metrics (MAE, MASE) and execution time, making it suitable
for short-term scenarios. The study highlights a methodological trade-off: HEF
is ideal for strategic planning, while FMAE is better suited for operational
efficiency. A replicable framework is proposed for optimizing predictive models
in dynamic environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.13057v1,,False
PC-Sampler: Position-Aware Calibration of Decoding Bias in Masked Diffusion Models,18/08/2025,"Pengcheng Huang, Shuhao Liu, Zhenghao Liu, Yukun Yan, Shuo Wang, Zulong Chen, Tong Xiao","Recent advances in masked diffusion models (MDMs) have established them as
powerful non-autoregressive alternatives for sequence generation. Nevertheless,
our preliminary experiments reveal that the generation quality of MDMs is still
highly sensitive to the choice of decoding strategy. In particular, widely
adopted uncertainty-based samplers suffer from two key limitations: a lack of
global trajectory control and a pronounced bias toward trivial tokens in the
early stages of decoding. These shortcomings restrict the full potential of
MDMs. In this work, we introduce Position-Aware Confidence-Calibrated Sampling
(PC-Sampler), a novel decoding strategy that unifies global trajectory planning
with content-aware informativeness maximization. PC-Sampler incorporates a
position-aware weighting mechanism to regulate the decoding path and a
calibrated confidence score to suppress the premature selection of trivial
tokens. Extensive experiments on three advanced MDMs across seven challenging
benchmarks-including logical reasoning and planning tasks-demonstrate that
PC-Sampler consistently outperforms existing MDM decoding strategies by more
than 10% on average, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
state-of-the-art autoregressive models. All codes are available at

OPTIC-ER: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Real-Time Emergency Response and Equitable Resource Allocation in Underserved African Communities,18/08/2025,Mary Tonwe,"Public service systems in many African regions suffer from delayed emergency
response and spatial inequity, causing avoidable suffering. This paper
introduces OPTIC-ER, a reinforcement learning (RL) framework for real-time,
adaptive, and equitable emergency response. OPTIC-ER uses an attention-guided
actor-critic architecture to manage the complexity of dispatch environments.
Its key innovations are a Context-Rich State Vector, encoding action
sub-optimality, and a Precision Reward Function, which penalizes inefficiency.
Training occurs in a high-fidelity simulation using real data from Rivers
State, Nigeria, accelerated by a precomputed Travel Time Atlas. The system is
built on the TALS framework (Thin computing, Adaptability, Low-cost,
Scalability) for deployment in low-resource settings. In evaluations on 500
unseen incidents, OPTIC-ER achieved a 100.00% optimality rate with negligible
inefficiency, confirming its robustness and generalization. Beyond dispatch,
the system generates Infrastructure Deficiency Maps and Equity Monitoring
Dashboards to guide proactive governance and data-informed development. This
work presents a validated blueprint for AI-augmented public services, showing
how context-aware RL can bridge the gap between algorithmic decision-making and
measurable human impact.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12943v1,,False

Lappalainen, Benjamin Kurt Miller, Pedro J. Gonçalves, Jan-Matthis Lueckmann, Cornelius Schröder, Jakob H. Macke","A central challenge in many areas of science and engineering is to identify
model parameters that are consistent with prior knowledge and empirical data.
Bayesian inference offers a principled framework for this task, but can be
computationally prohibitive when models are defined by stochastic simulators.
Simulation-based Inference (SBI) is a suite of methods developed to overcome
this limitation, which has enabled scientific discoveries in fields such as
particle physics, astrophysics, and neuroscience. The core idea of SBI is to
train neural networks on data generated by a simulator, without requiring
access to likelihood evaluations. Once trained, inference is amortized: The

without requiring additional training or simulations. In this tutorial, we
provide a practical guide for practitioners aiming to apply SBI methods. We
outline a structured SBI workflow and offer practical guidelines and diagnostic
tools for every stage of the process -- from setting up the simulator and
prior, choosing and training inference networks, to performing inference and
validating the results. We illustrate these steps through examples from
astrophysics, psychophysics, and neuroscience. This tutorial empowers

Towards Open-Ended Emotional Support Conversations in LLMs via Reinforcement Learning with Future-Oriented Rewards,18/08/2025,"Ting Yang, Li Chen, Huimin Wang","Emotional Support Conversation (ESC) systems aim to alleviate users'
emotional difficulties and provide long-term, systematic support for emotional
well-being. However, most large language model (LLM)-based ESC systems rely on
predefined strategies, which limits their effectiveness in complex, real-life
scenarios. To enable flexible responses to diverse emotional problem scenarios,
this paper introduces a novel end-to-end framework (RLFF-ESC) that directly
learns enduring emotionally supportive response skills using reinforcement
learning. For sustained emotional support, we first employ an LLM-based
multi-agent mechanism to simulate future dialogue trajectories and collect
future-oriented rewards. We then train a future-oriented reward model, which is
subsequently used to train the emotional support policy model. Additionally, we
incorporate an explicit reasoning process during response generation to further
enhance the quality, relevance, and contextual appropriateness of the system's
responses. We evaluate the backbone policy model on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-1M and
LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct models, testing the proposed RLFF-ESC framework across two
public ESC datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RLFF-ESC

CTFlow: Video-Inspired Latent Flow Matching for 3D CT Synthesis,18/08/2025,"Jiayi Wang, Hadrien Reynaud, Franciskus Xaverius Erick, Bernhard Kainz","Generative modelling of entire CT volumes conditioned on clinical reports has
the potential to accelerate research through data augmentation,
privacy-preserving synthesis and reducing regulator-constraints on patient data
while preserving diagnostic signals. With the recent release of CT-RATE, a
large-scale collection of 3D CT volumes paired with their respective clinical
reports, training large text-conditioned CT volume generation models has become

transformer model, conditioned on clinical reports. We leverage the A-VAE from
FLUX to define our latent space, and rely on the CT-Clip text encoder to encode
the clinical reports. To generate consistent whole CT volumes while keeping the
memory constraints tractable, we rely on a custom autoregressive approach,
where the model predicts the first sequence of slices of the volume from
text-only, and then relies on the previously generated sequence of slices and

Next Visual Granularity Generation,18/08/2025,"Yikai Wang, Zhouxia Wang, Zhonghua Wu, Qingyi Tao, Kang Liao, Chen Change Loy","We propose a novel approach to image generation by decomposing an image into
a structured sequence, where each element in the sequence shares the same
spatial resolution but differs in the number of unique tokens used, capturing
different level of visual granularity. Image generation is carried out through
our newly introduced Next Visual Granularity (NVG) generation framework, which
generates a visual granularity sequence beginning from an empty image and
progressively refines it, from global layout to fine details, in a structured
manner. This iterative process encodes a hierarchical, layered representation
that offers fine-grained control over the generation process across multiple
granularity levels. We train a series of NVG models for class-conditional image
generation on the ImageNet dataset and observe clear scaling behavior. Compared
to the VAR series, NVG consistently outperforms it in terms of FID scores (3.30

HeroBench: A Benchmark for Long-Horizon Planning and Structured Reasoning in Virtual Worlds,18/08/2025,"Petr Anokhin, Roman Khalikov, Stefan Rebrikov, Viktor Volkov, Artyom Sorokin, Vincent Bissonnette","Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in isolated
step-by-step reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming, but their
proficiency in long-horizon planning, where solutions require extended,
structured sequences of interdependent actions, remains underexplored. Existing
benchmarks typically assess LLMs through abstract or low-dimensional
algorithmic tasks, failing to capture the complexity of realistic planning
environments. We introduce HeroBench, a novel benchmark designed specifically
to evaluate long-horizon planning and structured reasoning within complex
RPG-inspired virtual worlds. HeroBench provides a rigorously constructed
dataset of tasks covering a wide range of difficulties, a simulated environment
to execute and validate agent plans, and detailed analytical tools for
evaluating model performance. Tasks challenge models to formulate strategic
plans, efficiently gather resources, master necessary skills, craft equipment,
and defeat adversaries, reflecting practical scenarios' layered dependencies
and constraints. Our extensive evaluation of 25 state-of-the-art LLMs, spanning
both open-source and proprietary models, including the GPT-5 family, reveals
substantial performance disparities rarely observed in conventional reasoning
benchmarks. Detailed error analysis further uncovers specific weaknesses in
current models' abilities to generate robust high-level plans and reliably
execute structured actions. HeroBench thus not only significantly advances the

Unlearning Comparator: A Visual Analytics System for Comparative Evaluation of Machine Unlearning Methods,18/08/2025,"Jaeung Lee, Suhyeon Yu, Yurim Jang, Simon S. Woo, Jaemin Jo","Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove target training data from a trained
model so that the removed data no longer influences the model's behavior,
fulfilling ""right to be forgotten"" obligations under data privacy laws. Yet, we
observe that researchers in this rapidly emerging field face challenges in
analyzing and understanding the behavior of different MU methods, especially in
terms of three fundamental principles in MU: accuracy, efficiency, and privacy.
Consequently, they often rely on aggregate metrics and ad-hoc evaluations,
making it difficult to accurately assess the trade-offs between methods. To
fill this gap, we introduce a visual analytics system, Unlearning Comparator,
designed to facilitate the systematic evaluation of MU methods. Our system
supports two important tasks in the evaluation process: model comparison and
attack simulation. First, it allows the user to compare the behaviors of two
models, such as a model generated by a certain method and a retrained baseline,
at class-, instance-, and layer-levels to better understand the changes made
after unlearning. Second, our system simulates membership inference attacks
(MIAs) to evaluate the privacy of a method, where an attacker attempts to
determine whether specific data samples were part of the original training set.
We evaluate our system through a case study visually analyzing prominent MU
methods and demonstrate that it helps the user not only understand model
behaviors but also gain insights that can inform the improvement of MU methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.12730v1,,False
Argos: A Decentralized Federated System for Detection of Traffic Signs in CAVs,18/08/2025,"Seyed Mahdi Haji Seyed Hossein, Alireza Hosseini, Soheil Hajian Manesh, Amirali Shahriary","Connected and automated vehicles generate vast amounts of sensor data daily,
raising significant privacy and communication challenges for centralized
machine learning approaches in perception tasks. This study presents a
decentralized, federated learning framework tailored for traffic sign detection

specialized local training using lightweight object detectors, aggregated model
parameters via algorithms like FedProx, FedAdam and FedAVG in a simulated

including varying server rounds, local epochs, client participation fractions,

Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation Model,18/08/2025,"Yongchun Zhu, Guanyu Jiang, Jingwu Chen, Feng Zhang, Xiao Yang, Zuotao Liu","Recently, motivated by the outstanding achievements of diffusion models, the
diffusion process has been employed to strengthen representation learning in
recommendation systems. Most diffusion-based recommendation models typically
utilize standard Gaussian noise in symmetric forward and reverse processes in
continuous data space. Nevertheless, the samples derived from recommendation
systems inhabit a discrete data space, which is fundamentally different from
the continuous one. Moreover, Gaussian noise has the potential to corrupt
personalized information within latent representations. In this work, we
propose a novel and effective method, named Asymmetric Diffusion Recommendation
Model (AsymDiffRec), which learns forward and reverse processes in an
asymmetric manner. We define a generalized forward process that simulates the
missing features in real-world recommendation samples. The reverse process is
then performed in an asymmetric latent feature space. To preserve personalized
information within the latent representation, a task-oriented optimization
strategy is introduced. In the serving stage, the raw sample with missing
features is regarded as a noisy input to generate a denoising and robust
representation for the final prediction. By equipping base models with
AsymDiffRec, we conduct online A/B tests, achieving improvements of +0.131% and

A Generalized Genetic Random Field Method for the Genetic Association Analysis of Sequencing Data,18/08/2025,"Ming Li, Zihuai He, Min Zhang, Xiaowei Zhan, Changshuai Wei, Robert C Elston, Qing Lu","With the advance of high-throughput sequencing technologies, it has become
feasible to investigate the influence of the entire spectrum of sequencing
variations on complex human diseases. Although association studies utilizing
the new sequencing technologies hold great promise to unravel novel genetic
variants, especially rare genetic variants that contribute to human diseases,
the statistical analysis of high-dimensional sequencing data remains a
challenge. Advanced analytical methods are in great need to facilitate
high-dimensional sequencing data analyses. In this article, we propose a
generalized genetic random field (GGRF) method for association analyses of
sequencing data. Like other similarity-based methods (e.g., SIMreg and SKAT),
the new method has the advantages of avoiding the need to specify thresholds
for rare variants and allowing for testing multiple variants acting in
different directions and magnitude of effects. The method is built on the
generalized estimating equation framework and thus accommodates a variety of
disease phenotypes (e.g., quantitative and binary phenotypes). Moreover, it has
a nice asymptotic property, and can be applied to small-scale sequencing data
without need for small-sample adjustment. Through simulations, we demonstrate
that the proposed GGRF attains an improved or comparable power over a commonly
used method, SKAT, under various disease scenarios, especially when rare
variants play a significant role in disease etiology. We further illustrate
GGRF with an application to a real dataset from the Dallas Heart Study. By

Data-driven particle dynamics: Structure-preserving coarse-graining for emergent behavior in non-equilibrium systems,18/08/2025,"Quercus Hernandez, Max Win, Thomas C. O'Connor, Paulo E. Arratia, Nathaniel Trask","Multiscale systems are ubiquitous in science and technology, but are
notoriously challenging to simulate as short spatiotemporal scales must be
appropriately linked to emergent bulk physics. When expensive high-dimensional
dynamical systems are coarse-grained into low-dimensional models, the entropic
loss of information leads to emergent physics which are dissipative,
history-dependent, and stochastic. To machine learn coarse-grained dynamics
from time-series observations of particle trajectories, we propose a framework
using the metriplectic bracket formalism that preserves these properties by
construction; most notably, the framework guarantees discrete notions of the
first and second laws of thermodynamics, conservation of momentum, and a
discrete fluctuation-dissipation balance crucial for capturing non-equilibrium
statistics. We introduce the mathematical framework abstractly before
specializing to a particle discretization. As labels are generally unavailable
for entropic state variables, we introduce a novel self-supervised learning
strategy to identify emergent structural variables. We validate the method on
benchmark systems and demonstrate its utility on two challenging examples: (1)
coarse-graining star polymers at challenging levels of coarse-graining while
preserving non-equilibrium statistics, and (2) learning models from high-speed
video of colloidal suspensions that capture coupling between local
rearrangement events and emergent stochastic dynamics. We provide open-source
