SpikingBrain Technical Report: Spiking Brain-inspired Large Models,05/09/2025,"Yuqi Pan, Yupeng Feng, Jinghao Zhuang, Siyu Ding, Zehao Liu, Bohan Sun, Yuhong Chou, Han Xu, Xuerui Qiu, Anlin Deng, Anjie Hu, Peng Zhou, Man Yao, Jibin Wu, Jian Yang, Guoliang Sun, Bo Xu, Guoqi Li","Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05276v1,,False
LatticeWorld: A Multimodal Large Language Model-Empowered Framework for Interactive Complex World Generation,05/09/2025,"Yinglin Duan, Zhengxia Zou, Tongwei Gu, Wei Jia, Zhan Zhao, Luyi Xu, Xinzhu Liu, Hao Jiang, Kang Chen, Shuang Qiu","Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo

HoPE: Hyperbolic Rotary Positional Encoding for Stable Long-Range Dependency Modeling in Large Language Models,05/09/2025,"Chang Dai, Hongyu Shan, Mingyang Song, Di Liang","Positional encoding mechanisms enable Transformers to model sequential
structure and long-range dependencies in text. While absolute positional
encodings struggle with extrapolation to longer sequences due to fixed
positional representations, and relative approaches like Alibi exhibit
performance degradation on extremely long contexts, the widely-used Rotary
Positional Encoding (RoPE) introduces oscillatory attention patterns that
hinder stable long-distance dependency modelling. We address these limitations
through a geometric reformulation of positional encoding. Drawing inspiration
from Lorentz transformations in hyperbolic geometry, we propose Hyperbolic
Rotary Positional Encoding (HoPE), which leverages hyperbolic functions to
implement Lorentz rotations on token representations. Theoretical analysis
demonstrates that RoPE is a special case of our generalized formulation. HoPE
fundamentally resolves RoPE's slation issues by enforcing monotonic decay of
attention weights with increasing token distances. Extensive experimental
results, including perplexity evaluations under several extended sequence
benchmarks, show that HoPE consistently exceeds existing positional encoding
methods. These findings underscore HoPE's enhanced capacity for representing
and generalizing long-range dependencies. Data and code will be available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05218v1,,False
BEDTime: A Unified Benchmark for Automatically Describing Time Series,05/09/2025,"Medhasweta Sen, Zachary Gottesman, Jiaxing Qiu, C. Bayan Bruss, Nam Nguyen, Tom Hartvigsen","Many recent studies have proposed general-purpose foundation models designed
for a variety of time series analysis tasks. While several established datasets
already exist for evaluating these models, previous works frequently introduce
their models in conjunction with new datasets, limiting opportunities for
direct, independent comparisons and obscuring insights into the relative
strengths of different methods. Additionally, prior evaluations often cover
numerous tasks simultaneously, assessing a broad range of model abilities
without clearly pinpointing which capabilities contribute to overall
performance. To address these gaps, we formalize and evaluate 3 tasks that test
a model's ability to describe time series using generic natural language: (1)
recognition (True/False question-answering), (2) differentiation (multiple
choice question-answering), and (3) generation (open-ended natural language
description). We then unify 4 recent datasets to enable head-to-head model
comparisons on each task. Experimentally, in evaluating 13 state-of-the-art
language, vision--language, and time series--language models, we find that (1)
popular language-only methods largely underperform, indicating a need for time
series-specific architectures, (2) VLMs are quite successful, as expected,
identifying the value of vision models for these tasks and (3) pretrained
multimodal time series--language models successfully outperform LLMs, but still
have significant room for improvement. We also find that all approaches exhibit
clear fragility in a range of robustness tests. Overall, our benchmark provides
a standardized evaluation on a task necessary for time series reasoning
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05215v1,,False
AI Agents for Web Testing: A Case Study in the Wild,05/09/2025,"Naimeng Ye, Xiao Yu, Ruize Xu, Tianyi Peng, Zhou Yu","Automated web testing plays a critical role in ensuring high-quality user
experiences and delivering business value. Traditional approaches primarily
focus on code coverage and load testing, but often fall short of capturing
complex user behaviors, leaving many usability issues undetected. The emergence
of large language models (LLM) and AI agents opens new possibilities for web
testing by enabling human-like interaction with websites and a general
awareness of common usability problems. In this work, we present WebProber, a
prototype AI agent-based web testing framework. Given a URL, WebProber
autonomously explores the website, simulating real user interactions,
identifying bugs and usability issues, and producing a human-readable report.
We evaluate WebProber through a case study of 120 academic personal websites,
where it uncovered 29 usability issues--many of which were missed by
traditional tools. Our findings highlight agent-based testing as a promising
direction while outlining directions for developing next-generation,
user-centered testing frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05197v1,,False
Exploring Situated Stabilities of a Rhythm Generation System through Variational Cross-Examination,05/09/2025,"Błażej Kotowski, Nicholas Evans, Behzad Haki, Frederic Font, Sergi Jordà","This paper investigates GrooveTransformer, a real-time rhythm generation
system, through the postphenomenological framework of Variational
Cross-Examination (VCE). By reflecting on its deployment across three distinct
artistic contexts, we identify three stabilities: an autonomous drum
accompaniment generator, a rhythmic control voltage sequencer in Eurorack
format, and a rhythm driver for a harmonic accompaniment system. The
versatility of its applications was not an explicit goal from the outset of the
project. Thus, we ask: how did this multistability emerge? Through VCE, we
identify three key contributors to its emergence: the affordances of system
invariants, the interdisciplinary collaboration, and the situated nature of its
development. We conclude by reflecting on the viability of VCE as a descriptive
and analytical method for Digital Musical Instrument (DMI) design, emphasizing
its value in uncovering how technologies mediate, co-shape, and are co-shaped
by users and contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05145v1,,False
Dynamical Learning in Deep Asymmetric Recurrent Neural Networks,05/09/2025,"Davide Badalotti, Carlo Baldassi, Marc Mézard, Mattia Scardecchia, Riccardo Zecchina","We show that asymmetric deep recurrent neural networks, enhanced with
additional sparse excitatory couplings, give rise to an exponentially large,
dense accessible manifold of internal representations which can be found by
different algorithms, including simple iterative dynamics. Building on the
geometrical properties of the stable configurations, we propose a distributed
learning scheme in which input-output associations emerge naturally from the
recurrent dynamics, without any need of gradient evaluation. A critical feature
enabling the learning process is the stability of the configurations reached at
convergence, even after removal of the supervisory output signal. Extensive
simulations demonstrate that this approach performs competitively on standard
AI benchmarks. The model can be generalized in multiple directions, both
computational and biological, potentially contributing to narrowing the gap
between AI and computational neuroscience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.05041v1,,False
High-Resolution Global Land Surface Temperature Retrieval via a Coupled Mechanism-Machine Learning Framework,05/09/2025,"Tian Xie, Huanfeng Shen, Menghui Jiang, Juan-Carlos Jiménez-Muñoz, José A. Sobrino, Huifang Li, Chao Zeng","Land surface temperature (LST) is vital for land-atmosphere interactions and
climate processes. Accurate LST retrieval remains challenging under
heterogeneous land cover and extreme atmospheric conditions. Traditional split
window (SW) algorithms show biases in humid environments; purely machine
learning (ML) methods lack interpretability and generalize poorly with limited
data. We propose a coupled mechanism model-ML (MM-ML) framework integrating
physical constraints with data-driven learning for robust LST retrieval. Our
approach fuses radiative transfer modeling with data components, uses MODTRAN
simulations with global atmospheric profiles, and employs physics-constrained
optimization. Validation against 4,450 observations from 29 global sites shows
MM-ML achieves MAE=1.84K, RMSE=2.55K, and R-squared=0.966, outperforming
conventional methods. Under extreme conditions, MM-ML reduces errors by over
50%. Sensitivity analysis indicates LST estimates are most sensitive to sensor
radiance, then water vapor, and less to emissivity, with MM-ML showing superior
stability. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our coupled modeling
strategy for retrieving geophysical parameters. The MM-ML framework combines
physical interpretability with nonlinear modeling capacity, enabling reliable
LST retrieval in complex environments and supporting climate monitoring and
ecosystem studies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04991v1,,False
Scaling Law for Large-Scale Pre-Training Using Chaotic Time Series and Predictability in Financial Time Series,05/09/2025,Yuki Takemoto,"Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04921v1,,False
SynGen-Vision: Synthetic Data Generation for training industrial vision models,05/09/2025,"Alpana Dubey, Suma Mani Kuriakose, Nitish Bhardwaj","We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04894v1,,False
"Cloning a Conversational Voice AI Agent from Call\,Recording Datasets for Telesales",05/09/2025,"Krittanon Kaewtawee, Wachiravit Modecrua, Krittin Pachtrachai, Touchapon Kraisingkorn","Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04871v1,,False
A Knowledge-Driven Diffusion Policy for End-to-End Autonomous Driving Based on Expert Routing,05/09/2025,"Chengkai Xu, Jiaqi Liu, Yicheng Guo, Peng Hang, Jian Sun","End-to-end autonomous driving remains constrained by the need to generate
multi-modal actions, maintain temporal stability, and generalize across diverse
scenarios. Existing methods often collapse multi-modality, struggle with
long-horizon consistency, or lack modular adaptability. This paper presents
KDP, a knowledge-driven diffusion policy that integrates generative diffusion
modeling with a sparse mixture-of-experts routing mechanism. The diffusion
component generates temporally coherent and multi-modal action sequences, while
the expert routing mechanism activates specialized and reusable experts
according to context, enabling modular knowledge composition. Extensive
experiments across representative driving scenarios demonstrate that KDP
achieves consistently higher success rates, reduced collision risk, and
smoother control compared to prevailing paradigms. Ablation studies highlight
the effectiveness of sparse expert activation and the Transformer backbone, and
activation analyses reveal structured specialization and cross-scenario reuse
of experts. These results establish diffusion with expert routing as a scalable
and interpretable paradigm for knowledge-driven end-to-end autonomous driving.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04853v1,,False
Enhancing Diversity in Large Language Models via Determinantal Point Processes,05/09/2025,"Yilei Chen, Souradip Chakraborty, Lorenz Wolf, Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis, Aldo Pacchiano","Supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning are two popular methods for
post-training large language models (LLMs). While improving the model's
performance on downstream tasks, they often reduce the model's output
diversity, leading to narrow, canonical responses. Existing methods to enhance
diversity are limited, either by operating at inference time or by focusing on
lexical differences. We propose a novel training method named DQO based on
determinantal point processes (DPPs) to jointly optimize LLMs for quality and
semantic diversity. Our approach samples and embeds a group of responses for
each prompt, then uses the determinant of a kernel-based similarity matrix to
measure diversity as the volume spanned by the embeddings of these responses.
Experiments across instruction-following, summarization, story generation, and
reasoning tasks demonstrate that our method substantially improves semantic
diversity without sacrificing model quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04784v1,,False
CoVeR: Conformal Calibration for Versatile and Reliable Autoregressive Next-Token Prediction,05/09/2025,"Yuzhu Chen, Yingjie Wang, Shunyu Liu, Yongcheng Jing, Dacheng Tao","Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04733v1,,False
Language-Driven Hierarchical Task Structures as Explicit World Models for Multi-Agent Learning,05/09/2025,Brennen Hill,"The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.04731v1,,False
