PPTArena: A Benchmark for Agentic PowerPoint Editing,02/12/2025,"Michael Ofengenden, Yunze Man, Ziqi Pang, Yu-Xiong Wang","We introduce PPTArena, a benchmark for PowerPoint editing that measures reliable modifications to real slides under natural-language instructions. In contrast to image-PDF renderings or text-to-slide generation, PPTArena focuses on in-place editing across 100 decks, 2125 slides, and over 800 targeted edits covering text, charts, tables, animations, and master-level styles. Each case includes a ground-truth deck, a fully specified target outcome, and a dual VLM-as-judge pipeline that separately scores instruction following and visual quality using both structural diffs and slide images. Building on this setting, we propose PPTPilot, a structure-aware slide-editing agent that plans semantic edit sequences, routes between high-level programmatic tools and deterministic XML operations for precise control, and verifies outputs through an iterative plan-edit-check loop against task-specific constraints. In our experiments, PPTPilot outperforms strong proprietary agents and frontier VLM systems by over 10 percentage points on compound, layout-sensitive, and cross-slide edits, with particularly large gains in visual fidelity and deck-wide consistency. Despite these improvements, existing agents still underperform on long-horizon, document-scale tasks in PPTArena, highlighting the remaining challenges in reliable PPT editing.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03042v1,,False
SMP: Reusable Score-Matching Motion Priors for Physics-Based Character Control,02/12/2025,"Yuxuan Mu, Ziyu Zhang, Yi Shi, Minami Matsumoto, Kotaro Imamura, Guy Tevet, Chuan Guo, Michael Taylor, Chang Shu, Pengcheng Xi, Xue Bin Peng","Data-driven motion priors that can guide agents toward producing naturalistic behaviors play a pivotal role in creating life-like virtual characters. Adversarial imitation learning has been a highly effective method for learning motion priors from reference motion data. However, adversarial priors, with few exceptions, need to be retrained for each new controller, thereby limiting their reusability and necessitating the retention of the reference motion data when training on downstream tasks. In this work, we present Score-Matching Motion Priors (SMP), which leverages pre-trained motion diffusion models and score distillation sampling (SDS) to create reusable task-agnostic motion priors. SMPs can be pre-trained on a motion dataset, independent of any control policy or task. Once trained, SMPs can be kept frozen and reused as general-purpose reward functions to train policies to produce naturalistic behaviors for downstream tasks. We show that a general motion prior trained on large-scale datasets can be repurposed into a variety of style-specific priors. Furthermore SMP can compose different styles to synthesize new styles not present in the original dataset. Our method produces high-quality motion comparable to state-of-the-art adversarial imitation learning methods through reusable and modular motion priors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SMP across a diverse suite of control tasks with physically simulated humanoid characters.

In-Context Sync-LoRA for Portrait Video Editing,02/12/2025,"Sagi Polaczek, Or Patashnik, Ali Mahdavi-Amiri, Daniel Cohen-Or","Editing portrait videos is a challenging task that requires flexible yet precise control over a wide range of modifications, such as appearance changes, expression edits, or the addition of objects. The key difficulty lies in preserving the subject's original temporal behavior, demanding that every edited frame remains precisely synchronized with the corresponding source frame. We present Sync-LoRA, a method for editing portrait videos that achieves high-quality visual modifications while maintaining frame-accurate synchronization and identity consistency. Our approach uses an image-to-video diffusion model, where the edit is defined by modifying the first frame and then propagated to the entire sequence. To enable accurate synchronization, we train an in-context LoRA using paired videos that depict identical motion trajectories but differ in appearance. These pairs are automatically generated and curated through a synchronization-based filtering process that selects only the most temporally aligned examples for training. This training setup teaches the model to combine motion cues from the source video with the visual changes introduced in the edited first frame. Trained on a compact, highly curated set of synchronized human portraits, Sync-LoRA generalizes to unseen identities and diverse edits (e.g., modifying appearance, adding objects, or changing backgrounds), robustly handling variations in pose and expression. Our results demonstrate high visual fidelity and strong temporal coherence, achieving a robust balance between edit fidelity and precise motion preservation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03013v1,,False
From Moderation to Mediation: Can LLMs Serve as Mediators in Online Flame Wars?,02/12/2025,"Dawei Li, Abdullah Alnaibari, Arslan Bisharat, Manny Sandoval, Deborah Hall, Yasin Silva, Huan Liu","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has opened new possibilities for AI for good applications. As LLMs increasingly mediate online communication, their potential to foster empathy and constructive dialogue becomes an important frontier for responsible AI research. This work explores whether LLMs can serve not only as moderators that detect harmful content, but as mediators capable of understanding and de-escalating online conflicts. Our framework decomposes mediation into two subtasks: judgment, where an LLM evaluates the fairness and emotional dynamics of a conversation, and steering, where it generates empathetic, de-escalatory messages to guide participants toward resolution. To assess mediation quality, we construct a large Reddit-based dataset and propose a multi-stage evaluation pipeline combining principle-based scoring, user simulation, and human comparison. Experiments show that API-based models outperform open-source counterparts in both reasoning and intervention alignment when doing mediation. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of current LLMs as emerging agents for online social mediation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.03005v1,,False
Identification of Multivariate Measurement Error Models,02/12/2025,Yingyao Hu,"This paper develops new identification results for multidimensional continuous measurement-error models where all observed measurements are contaminated by potentially correlated errors and none provides an injective mapping of the latent distribution. Using third order cross moments, the paper constructs a three way tensor whose unique decomposition, guaranteed by Kruskal theorem, identifies the factor loading matrices. Starting with a linear structure, the paper recovers the full distribution of latent factors by constructing suitable measurements and applying scalar or multivariate versions of Kotlarski identity. As a result, the joint distribution of the latent vector and measurement errors is fully identified without requiring injective measurements, showing that multivariate latent structure can be recovered in broader settings than previously believed. Under injectivity, the paper also provides user-friendly testable conditions for identification. Finally, this paper provides general identification results for nonlinear models using a newly-defined generalized Kruskal rank - signal rank - of intergral operators. These results have wide applicability in empirical work involving noisy or indirect measurements, including factor models, survey data with reporting errors, mismeasured regressors in econometrics, and multidimensional latent-trait models in psychology and marketing, potentially enabling more robust estimation and interpretation when clean measurements are unavailable.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02970v1,,False
Representation of Inorganic Synthesis Reactions and Prediction: Graphical Framework and Datasets,02/12/2025,"Samuel Andrello, Daniel Alabi, Simon J. L. Billinge","While machine learning has enabled the rapid prediction of inorganic materials with novel properties, the challenge of determining how to synthesize these materials remains largely unsolved. Previous work has largely focused on predicting precursors or reaction conditions, but only rarely on full synthesis pathways. We introduce the ActionGraph, a directed acyclic graph framework that encodes both the chemical and procedural structure, in terms of synthesis operations, of inorganic synthesis reactions. Using 13,017 text-mined solid-state synthesis reactions from the Materials Project, we show that incorporating PCA-reduced ActionGraph adjacency matrices into a $k$-nearest neighbors retrieval model significantly improves synthesis pathway prediction. While the ActionGraph framework only results in a 1.34% and 2.76% increase in precursor and operation F1 scores (average over varying numbers of PCA components) respectively, the operation length matching accuracy rises 3.4 times (from 15.8% to 53.3%). We observe an interesting trade-off where precursor prediction performance peaks at 10-11 PCA components while operation prediction continues improving up to 30 components. This suggests composition information dominates precursor selection while structural information is critical for operation sequencing. Overall, the ActionGraph framework demonstrates strong potential, and with further adoption, its full range of benefits can be effectively realized.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02947v1,,False
In Silico Development of Psychometric Scales: Feasibility of Representative Population Data Simulation with LLMs,02/12/2025,"Enrico Cipriani, Pavel Okopnyi, Danilo Menicucci, Simone Grassini","Developing and validating psychometric scales requires large samples, multiple testing phases, and substantial resources. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) enable the generation of synthetic participant data by prompting models to answer items while impersonating individuals of specific demographic profiles, potentially allowing in silico piloting before real data collection. Across four preregistered studies (N = circa 300 each), we tested whether LLM-simulated datasets can reproduce the latent structures and measurement properties of human responses. In Studies 1-2, we compared LLM-generated data with real datasets for two validated scales; in Studies 3-4, we created new scales using EFA on simulated data and then examined whether these structures generalized to newly collected human samples. Simulated datasets replicated the intended factor structures in three of four studies and showed consistent configural and metric invariance, with scalar invariance achieved for the two newly developed scales. However, correlation-based tests revealed substantial differences between real and synthetic datasets, and notable discrepancies appeared in score distributions and variances. Thus, while LLMs capture group-level latent structures, they do not approximate individual-level data properties. Simulated datasets also showed full internal invariance across gender. Overall, LLM-generated data appear useful for early-stage, group-level psychometric prototyping, but not as substitutes for individual-level validation. We discuss methodological limitations, risks of bias and data pollution, and ethical considerations related to in silico psychometric simulations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02910v1,,False
Towards a fully differentiable digital twin for solar cells,02/12/2025,"Marie Louise Schubert, Houssam Metni, Jan David Fischbach, Benedikt Zerulla, Marjan Krstić, Ulrich W.

Ronsin, Yasin Ameslon, Jens Harting, Thomas Kirchartz, Sandheep Ravishankar, Chris Dreessen, Eunchi Kim, Christian Sprau, Mohamed Hussein, Alexander Colsmann, Karen Forberich, Klaus Jäger, Pascal Friederich, Carsten Rockstuhl","Maximizing energy yield (EY) - the total electric energy generated by a solar cell within a year at a specific location - is crucial in photovoltaics (PV), especially for emerging technologies. Computational methods provide the necessary insights and guidance for future research. However, existing simulations typically focus on only isolated aspects of solar cells. This lack of consistency highlights the need for a framework unifying all computational levels, from material to cell properties, for accurate prediction and optimization of EY prediction. To address this challenge, a differentiable digital twin, Sol(Di)$^2$T, is introduced to enable comprehensive end-to-end optimization of solar cells. The workflow starts with material properties and morphological processing parameters, followed by optical and electrical simulations. Finally, climatic conditions and geographic location are incorporated to predict the EY. Each step is either intrinsically differentiable or replaced with a machine-learned surrogate model, enabling not only accurate EY prediction but also gradient-based optimization with respect to input parameters. Consequently, Sol(Di)$^2$T extends EY predictions to previously unexplored conditions. Demonstrated for an organic solar cell, the proposed framework marks a significant step towards tailoring solar cells for specific applications while ensuring maximal performance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02904v1,,False
HeteroJIVE: Joint Subspace Estimation for Heterogeneous Multi-View Data,02/12/2025,"Jingyang Li, Zhongyuan Lyu","Many modern datasets consist of multiple related matrices measured on a common set of units, where the goal is to recover the shared low-dimensional subspace. While the Angle-based Joint and Individual Variation Explained (AJIVE) framework provides a solution, it relies on equal-weight aggregation, which can be strictly suboptimal when views exhibit significant statistical heterogeneity (arising from varying SNR and dimensions) and structural heterogeneity (arising from individual components). In this paper, we propose HeteroJIVE, a weighted two-stage spectral algorithm tailored to such heterogeneity. Theoretically, we first revisit the ``non-diminishing"" error barrier with respect to the number of views $K$ identified in recent literature for the equal-weight case. We demonstrate that this barrier is not universal: under generic geometric conditions, the bias term vanishes and our estimator achieves the $O(K^{-1/2})$ rate without the need for iterative refinement. Extending this to the general-weight case, we establish error bounds that explicitly disentangle the two layers of heterogeneity. Based on this, we derive an oracle-optimal weighting scheme implemented via a data-driven procedure. Extensive simulations corroborate our theoretical findings, and an application to TCGA-BRCA multi-omics data validates the superiority of HeteroJIVE in practice.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02866v1,,False
Leveraging generative adversarial networks with spatially adaptive denormalization for multivariate stochastic seismic data inversion,02/12/2025,"Roberto Miele, Leonardo Azevedo","Probabilistic seismic inverse modeling often requires the prediction of both spatially correlated geological heterogeneities (e.g., facies) and continuous parameters (e.g., rock and elastic properties). Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide an efficient training-image-based simulation framework capable of reproducing complex geological models with high accuracy and comparably low generative cost. However, their application in stochastic geophysical inversion for multivariate property prediction is limited, as representing multiple coupled properties requires large and unstable networks with high memory and training demands. A more recent variant of GANs with spatially adaptive denormalization (SPADE-GAN) enables the direct conditioning of facies spatial distributions on local probability maps. Leveraging on such features, an iterative geostatistical inversion algorithm is proposed, SPADE-GANInv, integrating a pre-trained SPADE-GAN with geostatistical simulation, for the prediction of facies and multiple correlated continuous properties from seismic data. The SPADE-GAN is trained to reproduce realistic facies geometries, while sequential stochastic co-simulation predicts the spatial variability of the facies-dependent continuous properties. At each iteration, a set of subsurface realizations is generated and used to compute synthetic seismic data. The realizations providing the highest similarity coefficient to the observed data are used to update the subsurface probability models in the next iteration. The method is demonstrated on both 2-D synthetic scenarios and field data, targeting the prediction of facies, porosity, and acoustic impedance from full-stack seismic data. Results show that the algorithm enables accurate multivariate prediction, mitigates the impact of biased prior data, and accommodates additional local conditioning such as well logs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02863v1,,False
VLM as Strategist: Adaptive Generation of Safety-critical Testing Scenarios via Guided Diffusion,02/12/2025,"Xinzheng Wu, Junyi Chen, Naiting Zhong, Yong Shen","The safe deployment of autonomous driving systems (ADSs) relies on comprehensive testing and evaluation. However, safety-critical scenarios that can effectively expose system vulnerabilities are extremely sparse in the real world. Existing scenario generation methods face challenges in efficiently constructing long-tail scenarios that ensure fidelity, criticality, and interactivity, while particularly lacking real-time dynamic response capabilities to the vehicle under test (VUT). To address these challenges, this paper proposes a safety-critical testing scenario generation framework that integrates the high-level semantic understanding capabilities of Vision Language Models (VLMs) with the fine-grained generation capabilities of adaptive guided diffusion models. The framework establishes a three-layer hierarchical architecture comprising a strategic layer for VLM-directed scenario generation objective determination, a tactical layer for guidance function formulation, and an operational layer for guided diffusion execution. We first establish a high-quality fundamental diffusion model that learns the data distribution of real driving scenarios. Next, we design an adaptive guided diffusion method that enables real-time, precise control of background vehicles (BVs) in closed-loop simulation. The VLM is then incorporated to autonomously generate scenario generation objectives and guidance functions through deep scenario understanding and risk reasoning, ultimately guiding the diffusion model to achieve VLM-directed scenario generation. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can efficiently generate realistic, diverse, and highly interactive safety-critical testing scenarios. Furthermore, case studies validate the adaptability and VLM-directed generation performance of the proposed method.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02844v1,,False
Steering Vision-Language-Action Models as Anti-Exploration: A Test-Time Scaling Approach,02/12/2025,"Siyuan Yang, Yang Zhang, Haoran He, Ling Pan, Xiu Li, Chenjia Bai, Xuelong Li","Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, trained via flow-matching or diffusion objectives, excel at learning complex behaviors from large-scale, multi-modal datasets (e.g., human teleoperation, scripted policies). However, since VLAs incorporate diverse data modes in the pre-training stage, and the finetuning dataset often contains demonstration data collected in a kinematically suboptimal or undesirable way, it exists redundant action modes that are irrelevant to the success action modes of the downstream task. Specifically, we observe a critical inference-time fragility among various sampled noises after supervised finetuning of pre-trained VLAs. In this paper, we attribute this instability to the distribution shift between the VLA policy and the policy induced by stable success modes of the downstream task dataset. Thus, we propose \textbf{TACO}, a test-time-scaling (TTS) framework that applies a lightweight pseudo-count estimator as a high-fidelity verifier of action chunks. The VLA models integrated with TACO can execute the actions with maximum pseudo-count from all sampled action chunks, thereby preventing distribution shifts while preserving the generalization ability of VLAs since the constraint is applied only during inference. Our method resembles the classical anti-exploration principle in offline reinforcement learning (RL), and being gradient-free, it incurs significant computational benefits compared to RL update, especially for flow or diffusion-based VLAs which are difficult to perform RL update due to denoising process. Extensive experiments across four simulation benchmarks (RoboTwin2.0, Robotwin, LIBERO, SimplerEnv) and a dual-arm platform demonstrate that our method significantly improves the inference stability and success rates in downstream-task adaptations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02834v1,,False
A Comparative Study on How Data Normalization Affects Zero-Shot Generalization in Time Series Foundation Models,02/12/2025,"Ihab Ahmed, Denis Krompaß, Cheng Feng, Volker Tresp","We investigate input normalization methods for Time-Series Foundation Models (TSFMs). While normalization is well-studied in dataset-specific time-series models, it remains overlooked in TSFMs where generalization is critical. Time-series data, unlike text or images, exhibits significant scale variation across domains and channels, coupled with non-stationarity, can undermine TSFM performance regardless of architectural complexity. Through systematic evaluation across four architecturally diverse TSFMs, we empirically establish REVIN as the most efficient approach, reducing zero-shot MASE by 89\% relative to an un-normalized baseline and by 44\% versus other normalization methods, while matching the best in-domain accuracy (0.84 MASE) without any dataset-level preprocessing -- yielding the highest accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Yet its effect utilization depends on architectural design choices and optimization objective, particularly with respect to training loss scale sensitivity and model type (probabilistic, point-forecast, or LLM-based models).",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02833v1,,False
Beyond Paired Data: Self-Supervised UAV Geo-Localization from Reference Imagery Alone,02/12/2025,"Tristan Amadei, Enric Meinhardt-Llopis, Benedicte Bascle, Corentin Abgrall, Gabriele Facciolo","Image-based localization in GNSS-denied environments is critical for UAV autonomy. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on matching UAV images to geo-referenced satellite images; however, they typically require large-scale, paired UAV-satellite datasets for training. Such data are costly to acquire and often unavailable, limiting their applicability. To address this challenge, we adopt a training paradigm that removes the need for UAV imagery during training by learning directly from satellite-view reference images. This is achieved through a dedicated augmentation strategy that simulates the visual domain shift between satellite and real-world UAV views. We introduce CAEVL, an efficient model designed to exploit this paradigm, and validate it on ViLD, a new and challenging dataset of real-world UAV images that we release to the community. Our method achieves competitive performance compared to approaches trained with paired data, demonstrating its effectiveness and strong generalization capabilities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02737v1,,False
Generative modeling using evolved quantum Boltzmann machines,02/12/2025,Mark M. Wilde,"Born-rule generative modeling, a central task in quantum machine learning, seeks to learn probability distributions that can be efficiently sampled by measuring complex quantum states. One hope is for quantum models to efficiently capture probability distributions that are difficult to learn and simulate by classical means alone. Quantum Boltzmann machines were proposed about one decade ago for this purpose, yet efficient training methods have remained elusive. In this paper, I overcome this obstacle by proposing a practical solution that trains quantum Boltzmann machines for Born-rule generative modeling. Two key ingredients in the proposal are the Donsker-Varadhan variational representation of the classical relative entropy and the quantum Boltzmann gradient estimator of [Patel et al., arXiv:2410.12935]. I present the main result for a more general ansatz known as an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine [Minervini et al., arXiv:2501.03367], which combines parameterized real- and imaginary-time evolution. I also show how to extend the findings to other distinguishability measures beyond relative entropy. Finally, I present four different hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for the minimax optimization underlying training, and I discuss their theoretical convergence guarantees.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02721v1,,False
StockMem: An Event-Reflection Memory Framework for Stock Forecasting,02/12/2025,"He Wang, Wenyilin Xiao, Songqiao Han, Hailiang Huang","Stock price prediction is challenging due to market volatility and its sensitivity to real-time events. While large language models (LLMs) offer new avenues for text-based forecasting, their application in finance is hindered by noisy news data and the lack of explicit answers in text. General-purpose memory architectures struggle to identify the key drivers of price movements. To address this, we propose StockMem, an event-reflection dual-layer memory framework. It structures news into events and mines them along two dimensions: horizontal consolidation integrates daily events, while longitudinal tracking captures event evolution to extract incremental information reflecting market expectation discrepancies. This builds a temporal event knowledge base. By analyzing event-price dynamics, the framework further forms a reflection knowledge base of causal experiences. For prediction, it retrieves analogous historical scenarios and reasons with current events, incremental data, and past experiences. Experiments show StockMem outperforms existing memory architectures and provides superior, explainable reasoning by tracing the information chain affecting prices, enhancing decision transparency in financial forecasting.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02720v1,,False
Learning What to Attend First: Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning for Reliable Multimodal Emotion Understanding,02/12/2025,"Hyeongseop Rha, Jeong Hun Yeo, Junil Won, Se Jin Park, Yong Man Ro","In this paper, we present Modality-Importance-Guided Reasoning (MIGR), a framework designed to improve the reliability of reasoning-based multimodal emotion understanding in multimodal large language models. Although existing methods have advanced emotion understanding, they often suffer from reasoning drift: models gradually rely on their own generated text instead of multimodal evidence, and their explanations are overly shaped by visually initiated reasoning paths. To address these issues, we introduce Modality Importance (MI), a simple yet effective mechanism for identifying the emotion-dominant modality. Using MI, MIGR reorganizes reasoning sequences so that explanations begin from the modality most critical to the target emotion, preventing early reasoning from being misled by less informative cues. Our two-stage framework-comprising modality-aligned supervised fine-tuning and modality-aware reward optimization-encourages models to generate emotionally grounded, causally relevant, and coherence-preserving explanations. Experimental results on the DFEW benchmark show that MIGR substantially improves reasoning reliability, decreasing instances of correct predictions accompanied by emotionally inconsistent explanations from 18.10% to 7.37%. These results confirm the benefit of initiating reasoning from the emotion-dominant modality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02699v1,,False
Exploring Depth Generalization in Large Language Models for Solving Recursive Logic Tasks,02/12/2025,Zhiyuan He,"Large language models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across many tasks, yet face significant challenges when dealing with recursive reasoning problems, those requiring the resolution of nested hierarchical structures. While prior research has extensively studied length generalization (a model's ability to handle longer sequences than seen during training), we investigate a distinct and underexplored limitation: depth generalization. Here, depth refers to the number of nested levels in a hierarchical problem, such as the layers of parentheses in a mathematical expression or the nesting of logical clauses in a Boolean formula. Our work reveals that standard transformer architectures struggle with problems involving deeper recursion than encountered during training, even when they perform well on longer but non-nested sequences. This limitation stems from their inability to maintain stack-like behavior, the capacity to track and resolve multiple levels of nested dependencies. Through systematic analysis, we demonstrate how this architectural constraint leads to rapid performance decay as the depth of the recursion increases. To address this challenge, we develop a novel looped locate-and-replace pipeline that decomposes recursive problems into manageable subcomponents. The approach employs two specialized models: a locator that identifies solvable subexpressions and a replacer that evaluates these components while preserving the overall structure. We evaluated this method in three carefully designed domains: Boolean algebra, recursive arithmetic, and propositional logic, each with a controllable depth of recursion. We show that our method effectively alleviates the performance decay when tested on out-of-distribution recursion depth.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02677v1,,False
Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT): Fast and Accurate Molecular Generation via High-Fidelity Discrete Latents,02/12/2025,"Haozhuo Zheng, Cheng Wang, Yang Liu","The de novo generation of molecules with desirable properties is a critical challenge, where diffusion models are computationally intensive and autoregressive models struggle with error propagation. In this work, we introduce the Graph VQ-Transformer (GVT), a two-stage generative framework that achieves both high accuracy and efficiency. The core of our approach is a novel Graph Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) that compresses molecular graphs into high-fidelity discrete latent sequences. By synergistically combining a Graph Transformer with canonical Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) node ordering and Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), our VQ-VAE achieves near-perfect reconstruction rates. An autoregressive Transformer is then trained on these discrete latents, effectively converting graph generation into a well-structured sequence modeling problem. Crucially, this mapping of complex graphs to high-fidelity discrete sequences bridges molecular design with the powerful paradigm of large-scale sequence modeling, unlocking potential synergies with Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive experiments show that GVT achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance across major benchmarks like ZINC250k, MOSES, and GuacaMol, and notably outperforms leading diffusion models on key distribution similarity metrics such as FCD and KL Divergence. With its superior performance, efficiency, and architectural novelty, GVT not only presents a compelling alternative to diffusion models but also establishes a strong new baseline for the field, paving the way for future research in discrete latent-space molecular generation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02667v1,,False
"Distill, Forget, Repeat: A Framework for Continual Unlearning in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models",02/12/2025,"Naveen George, Naoki Murata, Yuhta Takida, Konda Reddy Mopuri, Yuki Mitsufuji","The recent rapid growth of visual generative models trained on vast web-scale datasets has created significant tension with data privacy regulations and copyright laws, such as GDPR's ``Right to be Forgotten.'' This necessitates machine unlearning (MU) to remove specific concepts without the prohibitive cost of retraining. However, existing MU techniques are fundamentally ill-equipped for real-world scenarios where deletion requests arrive sequentially, a setting known as continual unlearning (CUL). Naively applying one-shot methods in a continual setting triggers a stability crisis, leading to a cascade of degradation characterized by retention collapse, compounding collateral damage to related concepts, and a sharp decline in generative quality. To address this critical challenge, we introduce a novel generative distillation based continual unlearning framework that ensures targeted and stable unlearning under sequences of deletion requests. By reframing each unlearning step as a multi-objective, teacher-student distillation process, the framework leverages principles from continual learning to maintain model integrity. Experiments on a 10-step sequential benchmark demonstrate that our method unlearns forget concepts with better fidelity and achieves this without significant interference to the performance on retain concepts or the overall image quality, substantially outperforming baselines. This framework provides a viable pathway for the responsible deployment and maintenance of large-scale generative models, enabling industries to comply with ongoing data removal requests in a practical and effective manner.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02657v1,,False
SeeNav-Agent: Enhancing Vision-Language Navigation with Visual Prompt and Step-Level Policy Optimization,02/12/2025,"Zhengcheng Wang, Zichuan Lin, Yijun Yang, Haobo Fu, Deheng Ye","Existing Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) agents based on Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often suffer from perception errors, reasoning errors, and planning errors, which significantly hinder their navigation performance. To address these limitations, a novel VLN agent framework, named SeeNav-Agent, is proposed in this work. First, to reduce perception hallucinations of the visual module of the VLN agent, a dual-view Visual Prompt (VP) technique is introduced in the input space, which can also improve the agent's understanding of current spatial states. Subsequently, a novel step-level Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) method, Step Reward Group Policy Optimization (SRGPO), is designed for the post-training of VLN agents. In SRGPO, we first define verifiable process rewards for the navigation task, and then perform efficient step-level advantage estimation by randomly grouping different navigation steps. SRGPO provides dense reward signals for the reinforcement learning process of the VLN agent and enhances its planning capability. Experimental results on the EmbodiedBench Navigation benchmark indicate that by introducing the zero-shot VP module, the GPT-4.1 achieves a navigation success rate of 86.7%, surpassing the current best LVLM by approximately 20 percentage points (pp). Through post-training based on SRGPO, the Qwen2.5-VL-3B model reaches a navigation success rate of 72.3%, outperforming the best existing LVLM model by 5.6 pp. Moreover, compared to RFT algorithms such as GRPO and GiGPO, the proposed SRGPO demonstrates significant improvements in training stability, convergence efficiency, and generalization capability.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02631v1,,False

Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Inverse Problems (BPINN-IP): Application in Infrared Image Processing,02/12/2025,"Ali Mohammad-Djafari, Ning Chu, Li Wang","Inverse problems arise across scientific and engineering domains, where the goal is to infer hidden parameters or physical fields from indirect and noisy observations. Classical approaches, such as variational regularization and Bayesian inference, provide well established theoretical foundations for handling ill posedness. However, these methods often become computationally restrictive in high dimensional settings or when the forward model is governed by complex physics. Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a promising framework for solving inverse problems by embedding physical laws directly into the training process of neural networks. In this paper, we introduce a new perspective on the Bayesian Physics Informed Neural Network (BPINN) framework, extending classical PINNs by explicitly incorporating training data generation, modeling and measurement uncertainties through Bayesian prior modeling and doing inference with the posterior laws. Also, as we focus on the inverse problems, we call this method BPINN-IP, and we show that the standard PINN formulation naturally appears as its special case corresponding to the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate. This unified formulation allows simultaneous exploitation of physical constraints, prior knowledge, and data-driven inference, while enabling uncertainty quantification through posterior distributions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we consider inverse problems arising in infrared image processing, including deconvolution and super-resolution, and present results on both simulated and real industrial data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02495v1,,False
Q-BERT4Rec: Quantized Semantic-ID Representation Learning for Multimodal Recommendation,02/12/2025,"Haofeng Huang, Ling Gai","Sequential recommendation plays a critical role in modern online platforms such as e-commerce, advertising, and content streaming, where accurately predicting users' next interactions is essential for personalization. Recent Transformer-based methods like BERT4Rec have shown strong modeling capability, yet they still rely on discrete item IDs that lack semantic meaning and ignore rich multimodal information (e.g., text and image). This leads to weak generalization and limited interpretability. To address these challenges, we propose Q-Bert4Rec, a multimodal sequential recommendation framework that unifies semantic representation and quantized modeling. Specifically, Q-Bert4Rec consists of three stages: (1) cross-modal semantic injection, which enriches randomly initialized ID embeddings through a dynamic transformer that fuses textual, visual, and structural features; (2) semantic quantization, which discretizes fused representations into meaningful tokens via residual vector quantization; and (3) multi-mask pretraining and fine-tuning, which leverage diverse masking strategies -- span, tail, and multi-region -- to improve sequential understanding. We validate our model on public Amazon benchmarks and demonstrate that Q-Bert4Rec significantly outperforms many strong existing methods, confirming the effectiveness of semantic tokenization for multimodal sequential recommendation. Our source code will be publicly available on GitHub after publishing.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02474v1,,False
scCluBench: Comprehensive Benchmarking of Clustering Algorithms for Single-Cell RNA Sequencing,02/12/2025,"Ping Xu, Zaitian Wang, Zhirui Wang, Pengjiang Li, Jiajia Wang, Ran Zhang, Pengfei Wang, Yuanchun Zhou","Cell clustering is crucial for uncovering cellular heterogeneity in single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data by identifying cell types and marker genes. Despite its importance, benchmarks for scRNA-seq clustering methods remain fragmented, often lacking standardized protocols and failing to incorporate recent advances in artificial intelligence. To fill these gaps, we present scCluBench, a comprehensive benchmark of clustering algorithms for scRNA-seq data. First, scCluBench provides 36 scRNA-seq datasets collected from diverse public sources, covering multiple tissues, which are uniformly processed and standardized to ensure consistency for systematic evaluation and downstream analyses. To evaluate performance, we collect and reproduce a range of scRNA-seq clustering methods, including traditional, deep learning-based, graph-based, and biological foundation models. We comprehensively evaluate each method both quantitatively and qualitatively, using core performance metrics as well as visualization analyses. Furthermore, we construct representative downstream biological tasks, such as marker gene identification and cell type annotation, to further assess the practical utility. scCluBench then investigates the performance differences and applicability boundaries of various clustering models across diverse analytical tasks, systematically assessing their robustness and scalability in real-world scenarios. Overall, scCluBench offers a standardized and user-friendly benchmark for scRNA-seq clustering, with curated datasets, unified evaluation protocols, and transparent analyses, facilitating informed method selection and providing valuable insights into model generalizability and application scope.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02471v1,,False
TabGRU: An Enhanced Design for Urban Rainfall Intensity Estimation Using Commercial Microwave Links,02/12/2025,"Xingwang Li, Mengyun Chen, Jiamou Liu, Sijie Wang, Shuanggen Jin, Jafet C. M. Andersson, Jonas Olsson, Remco, van de Beek, Hai Victor Habi, Congzheng Han","In the face of accelerating global urbanization and the increasing frequency of extreme weather events, highresolution urban rainfall monitoring is crucial for building resilient smart cities. Commercial Microwave Links (CMLs) are an emerging data source with great potential for this task.While traditional rainfall retrieval from CMLs relies on physicsbased models, these often struggle with real-world complexities like signal noise and nonlinear attenuation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel hybrid deep learning architecture based on the Transformer and a Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU), which we name TabGRU. This design synergistically captures both long-term dependencies and local sequential features in the CML signal data. The model is further enhanced by a learnable positional embedding and an attention pooling mechanism to improve its dynamic feature extraction and generalization capabilities. The model was validated on a public benchmark dataset from Gothenburg, Sweden (June-September 2015). The evaluation used 12 sub-links from two rain gauges (Torp and Barl) over a test period (August 22-31) covering approximately 10 distinct rainfall events. The proposed TabGRU model demonstrated consistent advantages, outperforming deep learning baselines and achieving high coefficients of determination (R2) at both the Torp site (0.91) and the Barl site (0.96). Furthermore, compared to the physics-based approach, TabGRU maintained higher accuracy and was particularly effective in mitigating the significant overestimation problem observed in the PL model during peak rainfall events. This evaluation confirms that the TabGRU model can effectively overcome the limitations of traditional methods, providing a robust and accurate solution for CML-based urban rainfall monitoring under the tested conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02465v1,,False
QJoin: Transformation-aware Joinable Data Discovery Using Reinforcement Learning,02/12/2025,"Ning Wang, Sainyam Galhotra","Discovering which tables in large, heterogeneous repositories can be joined and by what transformations is a central challenge in data integration and data discovery. Traditional join discovery methods are largely designed for equi-joins, which assume that join keys match exactly or nearly so. These techniques, while efficient in clean, well-normalized databases, fail in open or federated settings where identifiers are inconsistently formatted, embedded, or split across multiple columns. Approximate or fuzzy joins alleviate minor string variations but cannot capture systematic transformations. We introduce QJoin, a reinforcement-learning framework that learns and reuses transformation strategies across join tasks. QJoin trains an agent under a uniqueness-aware reward that balances similarity with key distinctiveness, enabling it to explore concise, high-value transformation chains. To accelerate new joins, we introduce two reuse mechanisms: (i) agent transfer, which initializes new policies from pretrained agents, and (ii) transformation reuse, which caches successful operator sequences for similar column clusters. On the AutoJoin Web benchmark (31 table pairs), QJoin achieves an average F1-score of 91.0%. For 19,990 join tasks in NYC+Chicago open datasets, Qjoin reduces runtime by up to 7.4% (13,747 s) by using reusing. These results demonstrate that transformation learning and reuse can make join discovery both more accurate and more efficient.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02444v1,,False
Vehicle Dynamics Embedded World Models for Autonomous Driving,02/12/2025,"Huiqian Li, Wei Pan, Haodong Zhang, Jin Huang, Zhihua Zhong","World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02417v1,,False
Beyond Playtesting: A Generative Multi-Agent Simulation System for Massively Multiplayer Online Games,02/12/2025,"Ran Zhang, Kun Ouyang, Tiancheng Ma, Yida Yang, Dong Fang","Optimizing numerical systems and mechanism design is crucial for enhancing player experience in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) games. Traditional optimization approaches rely on large-scale online experiments or parameter tuning over predefined statistical models, which are costly, time-consuming, and may disrupt player experience. Although simplified offline simulation systems are often adopted as alternatives, their limited fidelity prevents agents from accurately mimicking real player reasoning and reactions to interventions. To address these limitations, we propose a generative agent-based MMO simulation system empowered by Large Language Models (LLMs). By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on large-scale real player behavioral data, we adapt LLMs from general priors to game-specific domains, enabling realistic and interpretable player decision-making. In parallel, a data-driven environment model trained on real gameplay logs reconstructs dynamic in-game systems. Experiments demonstrate strong consistency with real-world player behaviors and plausible causal responses under interventions, providing a reliable, interpretable, and cost-efficient framework for data-driven numerical design optimization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02358v1,,False
Video Diffusion Models Excel at Tracking Similar-Looking Objects Without Supervision,02/12/2025,"Chenshuang Zhang, Kang Zhang, Joon Son Chung, In So Kweon, Junmo Kim, Chengzhi Mao","Distinguishing visually similar objects by their motion remains a critical challenge in computer vision. Although supervised trackers show promise, contemporary self-supervised trackers struggle when visual cues become ambiguous, limiting their scalability and generalization without extensive labeled data. We find that pre-trained video diffusion models inherently learn motion representations suitable for tracking without task-specific training. This ability arises because their denoising process isolates motion in early, high-noise stages, distinct from later appearance refinement. Capitalizing on this discovery, our self-supervised tracker significantly improves performance in distinguishing visually similar objects, an underexplored failure point for existing methods. Our method achieves up to a 6-point improvement over recent self-supervised approaches on established benchmarks and our newly introduced tests focused on tracking visually similar items. Visualizations confirm that these diffusion-derived motion representations enable robust tracking of even identical objects across challenging viewpoint changes and deformations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02339v1,,False
Forecasting MBTA Transit Dynamics: A Performance Benchmarking of Statistical and Machine Learning Models,02/12/2025,"Sai Siddharth Nalamalpu, Kaining Yuan, Aiden Zhou, Eugene Pinsky","The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) is the main public transit provider in Boston, operating multiple means of transport, including trains, subways, and buses. However, the system often faces delays and fluctuations in ridership volume, which negatively affect efficiency and passenger satisfaction. To further understand this phenomenon, this paper compares the performance of existing and unique methods to determine the best approach in predicting gated station entries in the subway system (a proxy for subway usage) and the number of delays in the overall MBTA system. To do so, this research considers factors that tend to affect public transportation, such as day of week, season, pressure, wind speed, average temperature, and precipitation. This paper evaluates the performance of 10 statistical and machine learning models on predicting next-day subway usage. On predicting delay count, the number of models is extended to 11 per day by introducing a self-exciting point process model, representing a unique application of a point-process framework for MBTA delay modeling. This research involves experimenting with the selective inclusion of features to determine feature importance, testing model accuracy via Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Remarkably, it is found that providing either day of week or season data has a more substantial benefit to predictive accuracy compared to weather data; in fact, providing weather data generally worsens performance, suggesting a tendency of models to overfit.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02336v1,,False
Unlocking the Power of Boltzmann Machines by Parallelizable Sampler and Efficient Temperature Estimation,02/12/2025,"Kentaro Kubo, Hayato Goto","Boltzmann machines (BMs) are powerful energy-based generative models, but their heavy training cost has largely confined practical use to Restricted BMs (RBMs) trained with an efficient learning method called contrastive divergence. More accurate learning typically requires Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) Boltzmann sampling, but it is time-consuming due to the difficulty of parallelization for more expressive models. To address this limitation, we first propose a new Boltzmann sampler inspired by a quantum-inspired combinatorial optimization called simulated bifurcation (SB). This SB-inspired approach, which we name Langevin SB (LSB), enables parallelized sampling while maintaining accuracy comparable to MCMC. Furthermore, this is applicable not only to RBMs but also to BMs with general couplings. However, LSB cannot control the inverse temperature of the output Boltzmann distribution, which hinders learning and degrades performance. To overcome this limitation, we also developed an efficient method for estimating the inverse temperature during the learning process, which we call conditional expectation matching (CEM). By combining LSB and CEM, we establish an efficient learning framework for BMs with greater expressive power than RBMs. We refer to this framework as sampler-adaptive learning (SAL). SAL opens new avenues for energy-based generative modeling beyond RBMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02323v1,,False
Few-shot Protein Fitness Prediction via In-context Learning and Test-time Training,02/12/2025,"Felix Teufel, Aaron W. Kollasch, Yining Huang, Ole Winther, Kevin K. Yang, Pascal Notin, Debora S. Marks","Accurately predicting protein fitness with minimal experimental data is a persistent challenge in protein engineering. We introduce PRIMO (PRotein In-context Mutation Oracle), a transformer-based framework that leverages in-context learning and test-time training to adapt rapidly to new proteins and assays without large task-specific datasets. By encoding sequence information, auxiliary zero-shot predictions, and sparse experimental labels from many assays as a unified token set in a pre-training masked-language modeling paradigm, PRIMO learns to prioritize promising variants through a preference-based loss function. Across diverse protein families and properties-including both substitution and indel mutations-PRIMO outperforms zero-shot and fully supervised baselines. This work underscores the power of combining large-scale pre-training with efficient test-time adaptation to tackle challenging protein design tasks where data collection is expensive and label availability is limited.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.02315v1,,False
