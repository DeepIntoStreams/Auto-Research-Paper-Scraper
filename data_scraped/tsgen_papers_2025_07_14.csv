NeuralOS: Towards Simulating Operating Systems via Neural Generative Models,11/07/2025,"Luke Rivard, Sun Sun, Hongyu Guo, Wenhu Chen, Yuntian Deng","We introduce NeuralOS, a neural framework that simulates graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) of operating systems by directly predicting screen frames in
response to user inputs such as mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard events.
NeuralOS combines a recurrent neural network (RNN), which tracks computer
state, with a diffusion-based neural renderer that generates screen images. The
model is trained on a large-scale dataset of Ubuntu XFCE recordings, which
include both randomly generated interactions and realistic interactions
produced by AI agents. Experiments show that NeuralOS successfully renders
realistic GUI sequences, accurately captures mouse interactions, and reliably
predicts state transitions like application launches. Although modeling
fine-grained keyboard interactions precisely remains challenging, NeuralOS
offers a step toward creating fully adaptive, generative neural interfaces for
future human-computer interaction systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08800v1,,False
Adaptive Nonlinear Vector Autoregression: Robust Forecasting for Noisy Chaotic Time Series,11/07/2025,"Azimov Sherkhon, Susana Lopez-Moreno, Eric Dolores-Cuenca, Sieun Lee, Sangil Kim","Nonlinear vector autoregression (NVAR) and reservoir computing (RC) have
shown promise in forecasting chaotic dynamical systems, such as the Lorenz-63
model and El Nino-Southern Oscillation. However, their reliance on fixed
nonlinearities - polynomial expansions in NVAR or random feature maps in RC -
limits their adaptability to high noise or real-world data. These methods also
scale poorly in high-dimensional settings due to costly matrix inversion during
readout computation. We propose an adaptive NVAR model that combines
delay-embedded linear inputs with features generated by a shallow, learnable
multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The MLP and linear readout are jointly trained
using gradient-based optimization, enabling the model to learn data-driven
nonlinearities while preserving a simple readout structure. Unlike standard
NVAR, our approach avoids the need for an exhaustive and sensitive grid search
over ridge and delay parameters. Instead, tuning is restricted to neural
network hyperparameters, improving scalability. Initial experiments on chaotic
systems tested under noise-free and synthetically noisy conditions showed that
the adaptive model outperformed the standard NVAR in predictive accuracy and
showed robust forecasting under noisy conditions with a lower observation
frequency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08738v1,,False
Domain-Informed Operation Excellence of Gas Turbine System with Machine Learning,11/07/2025,"Waqar Muhammad Ashraf, Amir H. Keshavarzzadeh, Abdulelah S. Alshehri, Abdulrahman bin Jumah, Ramit Debnath, Vivek Dua","The domain-consistent adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) remains low in
thermal power plants due to the black-box nature of AI algorithms and low
representation of domain knowledge in conventional data-centric analytics. In
this paper, we develop a MAhalanobis Distance-based OPTimization (MAD-OPT)
framework that incorporates the Mahalanobis distance-based constraint to
introduce domain knowledge into data-centric analytics. The developed MAD-OPT
framework is applied to maximize thermal efficiency and minimize turbine heat
rate for a 395 MW capacity gas turbine system. We demonstrate that the MAD-OPT
framework can estimate domain-informed optimal process conditions under
different ambient conditions, and the optimal solutions are found to be robust
as evaluated by Monte Carlo simulations. We also apply the MAD-OPT framework to
estimate optimal process conditions beyond the design power generation limit of
the gas turbine system, and have found comparable results with the actual data
of the power plant. We demonstrate that implementing data-centric optimization
analytics without incorporating domain-informed constraints may provide
ineffective solutions that may not be implementable in the real operation of
the gas turbine system. This research advances the integration of the
data-driven domain knowledge into machine learning-powered analytics that
enhances the domain-informed operation excellence and paves the way for safe AI
adoption in thermal power systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08697v1,,False
Agentic Large Language Models for Conceptual Systems Engineering and Design,11/07/2025,"Soheyl Massoudi, Mark Fuge","Early-stage engineering design involves complex, iterative reasoning, yet
existing large language model (LLM) workflows struggle to maintain task
continuity and generate executable models. We evaluate whether a structured
multi-agent system (MAS) can more effectively manage requirements extraction,
functional decomposition, and simulator code generation than a simpler
two-agent system (2AS). The target application is a solar-powered water
filtration system as described in a cahier des charges. We introduce the
Design-State Graph (DSG), a JSON-serializable representation that bundles
requirements, physical embodiments, and Python-based physics models into graph
nodes. A nine-role MAS iteratively builds and refines the DSG, while the 2AS
collapses the process to a Generator-Reflector loop. Both systems run a total
of 60 experiments (2 LLMs - Llama 3.3 70B vs reasoning-distilled DeepSeek R1
70B x 2 agent configurations x 3 temperatures x 5 seeds). We report a JSON
validity, requirement coverage, embodiment presence, code compatibility,
workflow completion, runtime, and graph size. Across all runs, both MAS and 2AS
maintained perfect JSON integrity and embodiment tagging. Requirement coverage
remained minimal (less than 20\%). Code compatibility peaked at 100\% under
specific 2AS settings but averaged below 50\% for MAS. Only the
reasoning-distilled model reliably flagged workflow completion. Powered by
DeepSeek R1 70B, the MAS generated more granular DSGs (average 5-6 nodes)
whereas 2AS mode-collapsed. Structured multi-agent orchestration enhanced
design detail. Reasoning-distilled LLM improved completion rates, yet low
requirements and fidelity gaps in coding persisted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08619v1,,False
To Trade or Not to Trade: An Agentic Approach to Estimating Market Risk Improves Trading Decisions,11/07/2025,"Dimitrios Emmanoulopoulos, Ollie Olby, Justin Lyon, Namid R. Stillman","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic frameworks,
in which prompts trigger complex tool-based analysis in pursuit of a goal.
While these frameworks have shown promise across multiple domains including in
finance, they typically lack a principled model-building step, relying instead
on sentiment- or trend-based analysis. We address this gap by developing an
agentic system that uses LLMs to iteratively discover stochastic differential
equations for financial time series. These models generate risk metrics which
inform daily trading decisions. We evaluate our system in both traditional
backtests and using a market simulator, which introduces synthetic but causally
plausible price paths and news events. We find that model-informed trading
strategies outperform standard LLM-based agents, improving Sharpe ratios across
multiple equities. Our results show that combining LLMs with agentic model
discovery enhances market risk estimation and enables more profitable trading
decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08584v1,,False
AbbIE: Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder for Efficient Sequence Modeling,11/07/2025,"Preslav Aleksandrov, Meghdad Kurmanji, Fernando Garcia Redondo, David O'Shea, William Shen, Alex Iacob, Lorenzo Sani, Xinchi Qiu, Nicola Cancedda, Nicholas D. Lane","We introduce the Autoregressive Block-Based Iterative Encoder (AbbIE), a
novel recursive generalization of the encoder-only Transformer architecture,
which achieves better perplexity than a standard Transformer and allows for the
dynamic scaling of compute resources at test time. This simple, recursive
approach is a complement to scaling large language model (LLM) performance
through parameter and token counts. AbbIE performs its iterations in latent
space, but unlike latent reasoning models, does not require a specialized
dataset or training protocol. We show that AbbIE upward generalizes (ability to
generalize to arbitrary iteration lengths) at test time by only using 2
iterations during train time, far outperforming alternative iterative methods.
AbbIE's ability to scale its computational expenditure based on the complexity
of the task gives it an up to \textbf{12\%} improvement in zero-shot in-context
learning tasks versus other iterative and standard methods and up to 5\%
improvement in language perplexity. The results from this study open a new
avenue to Transformer performance scaling. We perform all of our evaluations on
model sizes up to 350M parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08567v1,,False
CircFormerMoE: An End-to-End Deep Learning Framework for Circular RNA Splice Site Detection and Pairing in Plant Genomes,11/07/2025,Tianyou Jiang,"Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are important components of the non-coding RNA
regulatory network. Previous circRNA identification primarily relies on
high-throughput RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data combined with alignment-based
algorithms that detect back-splicing signals. However, these methods face
several limitations: they can't predict circRNAs directly from genomic DNA
sequences and relies heavily on RNA experimental data; they involve high
computational costs due to complex alignment and filtering steps; and they are
inefficient for large-scale or genome-wide circRNA prediction. The challenge is
even greater in plants, where plant circRNA splice sites often lack the
canonical GT-AG motif seen in human mRNA splicing, and no efficient deep
learning model with strong generalization capability currently exists.
Furthermore, the number of currently identified plant circRNAs is likely far
lower than their true abundance. In this paper, we propose a deep learning
framework named CircFormerMoE based on transformers and mixture-of experts for
predicting circRNAs directly from plant genomic DNA. Our framework consists of
two subtasks known as splicing site detection (SSD) and splicing site pairing
(SSP). The model's effectiveness has been validated on gene data of 10 plant
species. Trained on known circRNA instances, it is also capable of discovering
previously unannotated circRNAs. In addition, we performed interpretability
analyses on the trained model to investigate the sequence patterns contributing
to its predictions. Our framework provides a fast and accurate computational
method and tool for large-scale circRNA discovery in plants, laying a
foundation for future research in plant functional genomics and non-coding RNA
annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08542v1,,False
Space filling positionality and the Spiroformer,11/07/2025,"M. Maurin, M. Á. Evangelista-Alvarado, P. Suárez-Serrato","Transformers excel when dealing with sequential data. Generalizing
transformer models to geometric domains, such as manifolds, we encounter the
problem of not having a well-defined global order. We propose a solution with
attention heads following a space-filling curve. As a first experimental
example, we present the Spiroformer, a transformer that follows a polar spiral
on the $2$-sphere.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08456v1,,False
RTNinja: a generalized machine learning framework for analyzing random telegraph noise signals in nanoelectronic devices,11/07/2025,"Anirudh Varanasi, Robin Degraeve, Philippe Roussel, Clement Merckling","Random telegraph noise is a prevalent variability phenomenon in
nanoelectronic devices, arising from stochastic carrier exchange at defect
sites and critically impacting device reliability and performance. Conventional
analysis techniques often rely on restrictive assumptions or manual
interventions, limiting their applicability to complex, noisy datasets. Here,
we introduce RTNinja, a generalized, fully automated machine learning framework
for the unsupervised analysis of random telegraph noise signals. RTNinja
deconvolves complex signals to identify the number and characteristics of
hidden individual sources, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. The
framework comprises two modular components: LevelsExtractor, which uses
Bayesian inference and model selection to denoise and discretize the signal;
and SourcesMapper, which infers source configurations through probabilistic
clustering and optimization. To evaluate performance, we developed a Monte
Carlo simulator that generates labeled datasets spanning broad signal-to-noise
ratios and source complexities; across 7000 such datasets, RTNinja consistently
demonstrated high-fidelity signal reconstruction and accurate extraction of
source amplitudes and activity patterns. Our results demonstrate that RTNinja
offers a robust, scalable, and device-agnostic tool for random telegraph noise
characterization, enabling large-scale statistical benchmarking,
reliability-centric technology qualification, predictive failure modeling, and
device physics exploration in next-generation nanoelectronics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08424v1,,False
SPINT: Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural Transformer for Consistent Intracortical Motor Decoding,11/07/2025,"Trung Le, Hao Fang, Jingyuan Li, Tung Nguyen, Lu Mi, Amy Orsborn, Uygar Sümbül, Eli Shlizerman","Intracortical Brain-Computer Interfaces (iBCI) aim to decode behavior from
neural population activity, enabling individuals with motor impairments to
regain motor functions and communication abilities. A key challenge in
long-term iBCI is the nonstationarity of neural recordings, where the
composition and tuning profiles of the recorded populations are unstable across
recording sessions. Existing methods attempt to address this issue by explicit
alignment techniques; however, they rely on fixed neural identities and require
test-time labels or parameter updates, limiting their generalization across
sessions and imposing additional computational burden during deployment. In
this work, we introduce SPINT - a Spatial Permutation-Invariant Neural
Transformer framework for behavioral decoding that operates directly on
unordered sets of neural units. Central to our approach is a novel
context-dependent positional embedding scheme that dynamically infers
unit-specific identities, enabling flexible generalization across recording
sessions. SPINT supports inference on variable-size populations and allows
few-shot, gradient-free adaptation using a small amount of unlabeled data from
the test session. To further promote model robustness to population
variability, we introduce dynamic channel dropout, a regularization method for
iBCI that simulates shifts in population composition during training. We
evaluate SPINT on three multi-session datasets from the FALCON Benchmark,
covering continuous motor decoding tasks in human and non-human primates. SPINT
demonstrates robust cross-session generalization, outperforming existing
zero-shot and few-shot unsupervised baselines while eliminating the need for
test-time alignment and fine-tuning. Our work contributes an initial step
toward a robust and scalable neural decoding framework for long-term iBCI
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08402v1,,False
Data-Driven Dimensional Synthesis of Diverse Planar Four-bar Function Generation Mechanisms via Direct Parameterization,11/07/2025,"Woon Ryong Kim, Jaeheun Jung, Jeong Un Ha, Donghun Lee, Jae Kyung Shim","Dimensional synthesis of planar four-bar mechanisms is a challenging inverse
problem in kinematics, requiring the determination of mechanism dimensions from
desired motion specifications. We propose a data-driven framework that bypasses
traditional equation-solving and optimization by leveraging supervised
learning. Our method combines a synthetic dataset, an LSTM-based neural network
for handling sequential precision points, and a Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architecture tailored to different linkage types. Each expert model is trained
on type-specific data and guided by a type-specifying layer, enabling both
single-type and multi-type synthesis. A novel simulation metric evaluates
prediction quality by comparing desired and generated motions. Experiments show
our approach produces accurate, defect-free linkages across various
configurations. This enables intuitive and efficient mechanism design, even for
non-expert users, and opens new possibilities for scalable and flexible
synthesis in kinematic design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08269v1,,False
CL3R: 3D Reconstruction and Contrastive Learning for Enhanced Robotic Manipulation Representations,11/07/2025,"Wenbo Cui, Chengyang Zhao, Yuhui Chen, Haoran Li, Zhizheng Zhang, Dongbin Zhao, He Wang","Building a robust perception module is crucial for visuomotor policy
learning. While recent methods incorporate pre-trained 2D foundation models
into robotic perception modules to leverage their strong semantic
understanding, they struggle to capture 3D spatial information and generalize
across diverse camera viewpoints. These limitations hinder the policy's
effectiveness, especially in fine-grained robotic manipulation scenarios. To
address these challenges, we propose CL3R, a novel 3D pre-training framework
designed to enhance robotic manipulation policies. Our method integrates both
spatial awareness and semantic understanding by employing a point cloud Masked
Autoencoder to learn rich 3D representations while leveraging pre-trained 2D
foundation models through contrastive learning for efficient semantic knowledge
transfer. Additionally, we propose a 3D visual representation pre-training
framework for robotic tasks. By unifying coordinate systems across datasets and
introducing random fusion of multi-view point clouds, we mitigate camera view
ambiguity and improve generalization, enabling robust perception from novel
viewpoints at test time. Extensive experiments in both simulation and the real
world demonstrate the superiority of our method, highlighting its effectiveness
in visuomotor policy learning for robotic manipulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08262v1,,False
InsightBuild: LLM-Powered Causal Reasoning in Smart Building Systems,11/07/2025,"Pinaki Prasad Guha Neogi, Ahmad Mohammadshirazi, Rajiv Ramnath","Smart buildings generate vast streams of sensor and control data, but
facility managers often lack clear explanations for anomalous energy usage. We
propose InsightBuild, a two-stage framework that integrates causality analysis
with a fine-tuned large language model (LLM) to provide human-readable, causal
explanations of energy consumption patterns. First, a lightweight causal
inference module applies Granger causality tests and structural causal
discovery on building telemetry (e.g., temperature, HVAC settings, occupancy)
drawn from Google Smart Buildings and Berkeley Office datasets. Next, an LLM,
fine-tuned on aligned pairs of sensor-level causes and textual explanations,
receives as input the detected causal relations and generates concise,
actionable explanations. We evaluate InsightBuild on two real-world datasets
(Google: 2017-2022; Berkeley: 2018-2020), using expert-annotated ground-truth
causes for a held-out set of anomalies. Our results demonstrate that combining
explicit causal discovery with LLM-based natural language generation yields
clear, precise explanations that assist facility managers in diagnosing and
mitigating energy inefficiencies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08235v1,,False
Can LLMs Reliably Simulate Real Students' Abilities in Mathematics and Reading Comprehension?,11/07/2025,"KV Aditya Srivatsa, Kaushal Kumar Maurya, Ekaterina Kochmar","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as proxy students in the
development of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) and in piloting test
questions. However, to what extent these proxy students accurately emulate the
behavior and characteristics of real students remains an open question. To
investigate this, we collected a dataset of 489 items from the National
Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), covering mathematics and reading
comprehension in grades 4, 8, and 12. We then apply an Item Response Theory
(IRT) model to position 11 diverse and state-of-the-art LLMs on the same
ability scale as real student populations. Our findings reveal that, without
guidance, strong general-purpose models consistently outperform the average
student at every grade, while weaker or domain-mismatched models may align
incidentally. Using grade-enforcement prompts changes models' performance, but
whether they align with the average grade-level student remains highly model-
and prompt-specific: no evaluated model-prompt pair fits the bill across
subjects and grades, underscoring the need for new training and evaluation
strategies. We conclude by providing guidelines for the selection of viable
proxies based on our findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.08232v1,,False
