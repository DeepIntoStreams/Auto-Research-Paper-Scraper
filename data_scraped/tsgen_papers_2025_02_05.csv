Minimax-Optimal Covariance Projected Spectral Clustering for High-Dimensional Nonspherical Mixtures,04/02/2025,"Chengzhu Huang, Yuqi Gu","In mixture models, nonspherical (anisotropic) noise within each cluster is
widely present in real-world data. We study both the minimax rate and optimal
statistical procedure for clustering under high-dimensional nonspherical
mixture models. In high-dimensional settings, we first establish the
information-theoretic limits for clustering under Gaussian mixtures. The
minimax lower bound unveils an intriguing informational dimension-reduction
phenomenon: there exists a substantial gap between the minimax rate and the
oracle clustering risk, with the former determined solely by the projected
centers and projected covariance matrices in a low-dimensional space. Motivated
by the lower bound, we propose a novel computationally efficient clustering
method: Covariance Projected Spectral Clustering (COPO). Its key step is to
project the high-dimensional data onto the low-dimensional space spanned by the
cluster centers and then use the projected covariance matrices in this space to
enhance clustering. We establish tight algorithmic upper bounds for COPO, both
for Gaussian noise with flexible covariance and general noise with local
dependence. Our theory indicates the minimax-optimality of COPO in the Gaussian
case and highlights its adaptivity to a broad spectrum of dependent noise.
Extensive simulation studies under various noise structures and real data
analysis demonstrate our method's superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02580v1,,False

Be","This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian multitask learning model that is
applicable to the general multi-task binary classification learning problem
where the model assumes a shared sparsity structure across different tasks. We
derive a computationally efficient inference algorithm based on variational
inference to approximate the posterior distribution. We demonstrate the
potential of the new approach on various synthetic datasets and for predicting
human health status based on microbiome profile. Our analysis incorporates data
pooled from multiple microbiome studies, along with a comprehensive comparison
with other benchmark methods. Results in synthetic datasets show that the
proposed approach has superior support recovery property when the underlying
regression coefficients share a common sparsity structure across different
tasks. Our experiments on microbiome classification demonstrate the utility of
the method in extracting informative taxa while providing well-calibrated
predictions with uncertainty quantification and achieving competitive
performance in terms of prediction metrics. Notably, despite the heterogeneity
of the pooled datasets (e.g., different experimental objectives, laboratory
setups, sequencing equipment, patient demographics), our method delivers robust
results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02552v1,,False
A weak convergence approach to large deviations for stochastic approximations,04/02/2025,"Henrik Hult, Adam Lindhe, Pierre Nyquist, Guo-Jhen Wu","The theory of stochastic approximations form the theoretical foundation for
studying convergence properties of many popular recursive learning algorithms
in statistics, machine learning and statistical physics. Large deviations for
stochastic approximations provide asymptotic estimates of the probability that
the learning algorithm deviates from its expected path, given by a limit ODE,
and the large deviation rate function gives insights to the most likely way
that such deviations occur.
  In this paper we prove a large deviation principle for general stochastic
approximations with state-dependent Markovian noise and decreasing step size.
Using the weak convergence approach to large deviations, we generalize previous
results for stochastic approximations and identify the appropriate scaling
sequence for the large deviation principle. We also give a new representation
for the rate function, in which the rate function is expressed as an action
functional involving the family of Markov transition kernels. Examples of
learning algorithms that are covered by the large deviation principle include
stochastic gradient descent, persistent contrastive divergence and the
Wang-Landau algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02529v1,,False
Learning to generate physical ocean states: Towards hybrid climate modeling,04/02/2025,"Etienne Meunier, David Kamm, Guillaume Gachon, Redouane Lguensat, Julie Deshayes","Ocean General Circulation Models require extensive computational resources to
reach equilibrium states, while deep learning emulators, despite offering fast
predictions, lack the physical interpretability and long-term stability
necessary for climate scientists to understand climate sensitivity (to
greenhouse gas emissions) and mechanisms of abrupt % variability such as
tipping points. We propose to take the best from both worlds by leveraging deep
generative models to produce physically consistent oceanic states that can
serve as initial conditions for climate projections. We assess the viability of
this hybrid approach through both physical metrics and numerical experiments,
and highlight the benefits of enforcing physical constraints during generation.
Although we train here on ocean variables from idealized numerical simulations,
we claim that this hybrid approach, combining the computational efficiency of
deep learning with the physical accuracy of numerical models, can effectively
reduce the computational burden of running climate models to equilibrium, and
reduce uncertainties in climate projections by minimizing drifts in baseline
simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02499v1,,False
EasySpec: Layer-Parallel Speculative Decoding for Efficient Multi-GPU Utilization,04/02/2025,"Yize Wu, Ke Gao, Yanjun Wu","Speculative decoding is an effective and lossless method for Large Language
Model (LLM) inference acceleration. It employs a smaller model to generate a
draft token sequence, which is then verified by the original base model. In
multi-GPU systems, inference latency can be further reduced through tensor
parallelism (TP), while the optimal TP size of the draft model is typically
smaller than that of the base model, leading to GPU idling during the drafting
stage. To solve this problem, we propose EasySpec, a layer-parallel speculation
strategy that optimizes the efficiency of multi-GPU utilization.EasySpec breaks
the sequential execution order of layers in the drafting model, enabling
multi-layer parallelization across devices, albeit with some induced
approximation errors. After each drafting-and-verification iteration, the draft
model's key-value (KV) cache is calibrated in a single forward pass, preventing
long-term error accumulation at minimal additional latency. We evaluated
EasySpec on several mainstream open-source LLMs, using smaller versions of
models from the same series as drafters. The results demonstrate that EasySpec
can achieve a peak speedup of 4.17x compared to vanilla decoding, while
preserving the original distribution of the base LLMs. Specifically, the
drafting stage can be accelerated by up to 1.62x with a maximum accuracy drop
of only 7%, requiring no training or fine-tuning on the draft models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02493v1,,False
Stable Port-Hamiltonian Neural Networks,04/02/2025,"Fabian J. Roth, Dominik K. Klein, Maximilian Kannapinn, Jan Peters, Oliver Weeger","In recent years, nonlinear dynamic system identification using artificial
neural networks has garnered attention due to its manifold potential
applications in virtually all branches of science and engineering. However,
purely data-driven approaches often struggle with extrapolation and may yield
physically implausible forecasts. Furthermore, the learned dynamics can exhibit
instabilities, making it difficult to apply such models safely and robustly.
This article proposes stable port-Hamiltonian neural networks, a machine
learning architecture that incorporates the physical biases of energy
conservation or dissipation while guaranteeing global Lyapunov stability of the
learned dynamics. Evaluations with illustrative examples and real-world

Inspired by modern Score- and Flow Matching algorithms for learning generative

Orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network in polycrystalline materials modeling,04/02/2025,"Ting-Ju Wei, Tung-Huan Su, Chuin-Shan Chen","Multiscale simulations are indispensable for connecting microstructural
features to the macroscopic behavior of polycrystalline materials, but their
high computational demands limit their practicality. Deep material networks

capturing texture evolution. To address this limitation, we propose the
orientation-aware interaction-based deep material network (ODMN), which
incorporates an orientation-aware mechanism and an interaction mechanism
grounded in the Hill-Mandel principle. The orientation-aware mechanism learns
the crystallographic textures, while the interaction mechanism captures
stress-equilibrium directions among representative volume element (RVE)
subregions, offering insight into internal microstructural mechanics. Notably,
ODMN requires only linear elastic data for training yet generalizes effectively
to complex nonlinear and anisotropic responses. Our results show that ODMN

Model Human Learners: Computational Models to Guide Instructional Design,04/02/2025,Christopher J. MacLellan,"Instructional designers face an overwhelming array of design choices, making
it challenging to identify the most effective interventions. To address this

model of learning that can aid designers in evaluating candidate interventions.
This paper presents the first successful demonstration of this concept, showing
that a computational model can accurately predict the outcomes of two human A/B
experiments -- one testing a problem sequencing intervention and the other
testing an item design intervention. It also demonstrates that such a model can
generate learning curves without requiring human data and provide theoretical
insights into why an instructional intervention is effective. These findings

Towards graph neural networks for provably solving convex optimization problems,04/02/2025,"Chendi Qian, Christopher Morris","Recently, message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have shown potential
for solving combinatorial and continuous optimization problems due to their
ability to capture variable-constraint interactions. While existing approaches
leverage MPNNs to approximate solutions or warm-start traditional solvers, they
often lack guarantees for feasibility, particularly in convex optimization
settings. Here, we propose an iterative MPNN framework to solve convex
optimization problems with provable feasibility guarantees. First, we
demonstrate that MPNNs can provably simulate standard interior-point methods
for solving quadratic problems with linear constraints, covering relevant
problems such as SVMs. Secondly, to ensure feasibility, we introduce a variant
that starts from a feasible point and iteratively restricts the search within
the feasible region. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms
existing neural baselines in solution quality and feasibility, generalizes well
to unseen problem sizes, and, in some cases, achieves faster solution times

Towards Fast Graph Generation via Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling,04/02/2025,"Markus Krimmel, Jenna Wiens, Karsten Borgwardt, Dexiong Chen","Graph generative models often face a critical trade-off between learning
complex distributions and achieving fast generation speed. We introduce
Autoregressive Noisy Filtration Modeling (ANFM), a novel approach that
addresses both challenges. ANFM leverages filtration, a concept from
topological data analysis, to transform graphs into short sequences of
monotonically increasing subgraphs. This formulation extends the sequence
families used in previous autoregressive models. To learn from these sequences,
we propose a novel autoregressive graph mixer model. Our experiments suggest
that exposure bias might represent a substantial hurdle in autoregressive graph
generation and we introduce two mitigation strategies to address it: noise
augmentation and a reinforcement learning approach. Incorporating these
techniques leads to substantial performance gains, making ANFM competitive with
state-of-the-art diffusion models across diverse synthetic and real-world
datasets. Notably, ANFM produces remarkably short sequences, achieving a
100-fold speedup in generation time compared to diffusion models. This work

Privacy Amplification by Structured Subsampling for Deep Differentially Private Time Series Forecasting,04/02/2025,"Jan Schuchardt, Mina Dalirrooyfard, Jed Guzelkabaagac, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Stephan Günnemann","Many forms of sensitive data, such as web traffic, mobility data, or hospital
occupancy, are inherently sequential. The standard method for training machine
learning models while ensuring privacy for units of sensitive information, such
as individual hospital visits, is differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD). However, we observe in this work that the formal guarantees
of DP-SGD are incompatible with timeseries-specific tasks like forecasting,
since they rely on the privacy amplification attained by training on small,
unstructured batches sampled from an unstructured dataset. In contrast, batches
for forecasting are generated by (1) sampling sequentially structured time
series from a dataset, (2) sampling contiguous subsequences from these series,
and (3) partitioning them into context and ground-truth forecast windows. We
theoretically analyze the privacy amplification attained by this structured
subsampling to enable the training of forecasting models with sound and tight
event- and user-level privacy guarantees. Towards more private models, we
additionally prove how data augmentation amplifies privacy in self-supervised

FewTopNER: Integrating Few-Shot Learning with Topic Modeling and Named Entity Recognition in a Multilingual Framework,04/02/2025,"Ibrahim Bouabdallaoui, Fatima Guerouate, Samya Bouhaddour, Chaimae Saadi, Mohammed Sbihi","We introduce FewTopNER, a novel framework that integrates few-shot named
entity recognition (NER) with topic-aware contextual modeling to address the
challenges of cross-lingual and low-resource scenarios. FewTopNER leverages a
shared multilingual encoder based on XLM-RoBERTa, augmented with
language-specific calibration mechanisms, to generate robust contextual
embeddings. The architecture comprises a prototype-based entity recognition
branch, employing BiLSTM and Conditional Random Fields for sequence labeling,
and a topic modeling branch that extracts document-level semantic features
through hybrid probabilistic and neural methods. A cross-task bridge
facilitates dynamic bidirectional attention and feature fusion between entity
and topic representations, thereby enhancing entity disambiguation by
incorporating global semantic context. Empirical evaluations on multilingual
benchmarks across English, French, Spanish, German, and Italian demonstrate
that FewTopNER significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art few-shot NER
models. In particular, the framework achieves improvements of 2.5-4.0
percentage points in F1 score and exhibits enhanced topic coherence, as
measured by normalized pointwise mutual information. Ablation studies further
confirm the critical contributions of the shared encoder and cross-task
integration mechanisms to the overall performance. These results underscore the
efficacy of incorporating topic-aware context into few-shot NER and highlight
the potential of FewTopNER for robust cross-lingual applications in
low-resource settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02391v1,,False
Adaptive Resource Allocation Optimization Using Large Language Models in Dynamic Wireless Environments,04/02/2025,"Hyeonho Noh, Byonghyo Shim, Hyun Jong Yang","Deep learning (DL) has made notable progress in addressing complex radio
access network control challenges that conventional analytic methods have
struggled to solve. However, DL has shown limitations in solving constrained
NP-hard problems often encountered in network optimization, such as those
involving quality of service (QoS) or discrete variables like user indices.
Current solutions rely on domain-specific architectures or heuristic
techniques, and a general DL approach for constrained optimization remains
undeveloped. Moreover, even minor changes in communication objectives demand
time-consuming retraining, limiting their adaptability to dynamic environments
where task objectives, constraints, environmental factors, and communication
scenarios frequently change. To address these challenges, we propose a large
language model for resource allocation optimizer (LLM-RAO), a novel approach
that harnesses the capabilities of LLMs to address the complex resource
allocation problem while adhering to QoS constraints. By employing a
prompt-based tuning strategy to flexibly convey ever-changing task descriptions
and requirements to the LLM, LLM-RAO demonstrates robust performance and
seamless adaptability in dynamic environments without requiring extensive
retraining. Simulation results reveal that LLM-RAO achieves up to a 40%
performance enhancement compared to conventional DL methods and up to an $80$\%
improvement over analytical approaches. Moreover, in scenarios with fluctuating
communication objectives, LLM-RAO attains up to 2.9 times the performance of
traditional DL-based networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02287v1,,False

Flatten Graphs as Sequences: Transformers are Scalable Graph Generators,04/02/2025,"Dexiong Chen, Markus Krimmel, Karsten Borgwardt","We introduce AutoGraph, a novel autoregressive framework for generating large
attributed graphs using decoder-only transformers. At the core of our approach

transformers to model and generate complex graph structures in a manner akin to
natural language. In contrast to diffusion models that rely on computationally
intensive node features, our approach operates exclusively on these sequences.
The sampling complexity and sequence length scale linearly with the number of
edges, making AutoGraph highly scalable for generating large sparse graphs.
Empirically, AutoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse
synthetic and molecular graph generation benchmarks, while delivering a

waypoints in milliseconds, enabling drones to perform agile maneuvers in
complex environments without building separate perception, mapping, and

reinforcement learning (RL), demonstrate promising performance in visual
navigation but still face inherent limitations. BC is susceptible to
compounding errors due to limited expert imitation, while RL struggles with
reward function design and sample inefficiency. To address these limitations,
this paper proposes an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)-based framework for
high-speed visual navigation. By leveraging IRL, it is possible to reduce the
number of interactions with simulation environments and improve capability to
deal with high-dimensional spaces while preserving the robustness of RL
policies. A motion primitive-based path planning algorithm collects an expert

representation learning, is crucial for manipulating these shapes with
mathematical and statistical tools for tasks like classification, clustering,
and generation. Recent years have witnessed significant strides in this domain,
yet most efforts focus on the vertex sequence of a polyhedron, neglecting the
complex surface modeling crucial in real-world polyhedral objects. This study
proposes \textbf{PolyhedronNet}, a general framework tailored for learning
representations of 3D polyhedral objects. We propose the concept of the
surface-attributed graph to seamlessly model the vertices, edges, faces, and
their geometric interrelationships within a polyhedron. To effectively learn
the representation of the entire surface-attributed graph, we first propose to
break it down into local rigid representations to effectively learn each local
region's relative positions against the remaining regions without geometric
information loss. Subsequently, we propose PolyhedronGNN to hierarchically
aggregate the local rigid representation via intra-face and inter-face
geometric message passing modules, to obtain a global representation that
minimizes information loss while maintaining rotation and translation
invariance. Our experimental evaluations on four distinct datasets,
encompassing both classification and retrieval tasks, substantiate
PolyhedronNet's efficacy in capturing comprehensive and informative
representations of 3D polyhedral objects. Code and data are available at

Policy Design for Two-sided Platforms with Participation Dynamics,03/02/2025,"Haruka Kiyohara, Fan Yao, Sarah Dean","In two-sided platforms (e.g., video streaming or e-commerce), viewers and
providers engage in interactive dynamics, where an increased provider
population results in higher viewer utility and the increase of viewer
population results in higher provider utility. Despite the importance of such
""population effects"" on long-term platform health, recommendation policies do
not generally take the participation dynamics into account. This paper thus
studies the dynamics and policy design on two-sided platforms under the
population effects for the first time. Our control- and game-theoretic findings
warn against the use of myopic-greedy policy and shed light on the importance
of provider-side considerations (i.e., effectively distributing exposure among
provider groups) to improve social welfare via population growth. We also
present a simple algorithm to optimize long-term objectives by considering the
population effects, and demonstrate its effectiveness in synthetic and
real-data experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01792v1,,False
GNN-DT: Graph Neural Network Enhanced Decision Transformer for Efficient Optimization in Dynamic Environments,03/02/2025,"Stavros Orfanoudakis, Nanda Kishor Panda, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara","Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods used for solving real-world optimization
problems often involve dynamic state-action spaces, larger scale, and sparse
rewards, leading to significant challenges in convergence, scalability, and
efficient exploration of the solution space. This study introduces GNN-DT, a
novel Decision Transformer (DT) architecture that integrates Graph Neural
Network (GNN) embedders with a novel residual connection between input and
output tokens crucial for handling dynamic environments. By learning from
previously collected trajectories, GNN-DT reduces dependence on accurate
simulators and tackles the sparse rewards limitations of online RL algorithms.
We evaluate GNN-DT on the complex electric vehicle (EV) charging optimization
problem and prove that its performance is superior and requires significantly
fewer training trajectories, thus improving sample efficiency compared to
existing DT baselines. Furthermore, GNN-DT exhibits robust generalization to
unseen environments and larger action spaces, addressing a critical gap in
prior DT-based approaches",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01778v1,,False
Improving Transformer World Models for Data-Efficient RL,03/02/2025,"Antoine Dedieu, Joseph Ortiz, Xinghua Lou, Carter Wendelken, Wolfgang Lehrach, J Swaroop Guntupalli, Miguel Lazaro-Gredilla, Kevin Patrick Murphy","We present an approach to model-based RL that achieves a new state of the art
performance on the challenging Craftax-classic benchmark, an open-world 2D
survival game that requires agents to exhibit a wide range of general abilities
-- such as strong generalization, deep exploration, and long-term reasoning.
With a series of careful design choices aimed at improving sample efficiency,
our MBRL algorithm achieves a reward of 67.4% after only 1M environment steps,
significantly outperforming DreamerV3, which achieves 53.2%, and, for the first
time, exceeds human performance of 65.0%. Our method starts by constructing a
SOTA model-free baseline, using a novel policy architecture that combines CNNs
and RNNs. We then add three improvements to the standard MBRL setup: (a) ""Dyna
with warmup"", which trains the policy on real and imaginary data, (b) ""nearest
neighbor tokenizer"" on image patches, which improves the scheme to create the
transformer world model (TWM) inputs, and (c) ""block teacher forcing"", which
allows the TWM to reason jointly about the future tokens of the next timestep.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01591v1,,False
A Differentiable Alignment Framework for Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling via Optimal Transport,03/02/2025,"Yacouba Kaloga, Shashi Kumar, Petr Motlicek, Ina Kodrasi","Accurate sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) alignment is critical for
applications like medical speech analysis and language learning tools relying
on automatic speech recognition (ASR). State-of-the-art end-to-end (E2E) ASR
systems, such as the Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC) and
transducer-based models, suffer from peaky behavior and alignment inaccuracies.
In this paper, we propose a novel differentiable alignment framework based on
one-dimensional optimal transport, enabling the model to learn a single
alignment and perform ASR in an E2E manner. We introduce a pseudo-metric,
called Sequence Optimal Transport Distance (SOTD), over the sequence space and
discuss its theoretical properties. Based on the SOTD, we propose Optimal
Temporal Transport Classification (OTTC) loss for ASR and contrast its behavior
with CTC. Experimental results on the TIMIT, AMI, and LibriSpeech datasets show
that our method considerably improves alignment performance, though with a
trade-off in ASR performance when compared to CTC. We believe this work opens
new avenues for seq2seq alignment research, providing a solid foundation for
further exploration and development within the community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01588v1,,False
Heterogeneous Treatment Effect in Time-to-Event Outcomes: Harnessing Censored Data with Recursively Imputed Trees,03/02/2025,"Tomer Meir, Uri Shalit, Malka Gorfine","Tailoring treatments to individual needs is a central goal in fields such as
medicine. A key step toward this goal is estimating Heterogeneous Treatment
Effects (HTE) - the way treatments impact different subgroups. While crucial,
HTE estimation is challenging with survival data, where time until an event
(e.g., death) is key. Existing methods often assume complete observation, an
assumption violated in survival data due to right-censoring, leading to bias
and inefficiency. Cui et al. (2023) proposed a doubly-robust method for HTE
estimation in survival data under no hidden confounders, combining a causal
survival forest with an augmented inverse-censoring weighting estimator.
However, we find it struggles under heavy censoring, which is common in
rare-outcome problems such as Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Moreover,
most current methods cannot handle instrumental variables, which are a crucial
tool in the causal inference arsenal. We introduce Multiple Imputation for
Survival Treatment Response (MISTR), a novel, general, and non-parametric
method for estimating HTE in survival data. MISTR uses recursively imputed
survival trees to handle censoring without directly modeling the censoring
mechanism. Through extensive simulations and analysis of two real-world
datasets-the AIDS Clinical Trials Group Protocol 175 and the Illinois
unemployment dataset we show that MISTR outperforms prior methods under heavy
censoring in the no-hidden-confounders setting, and extends to the instrumental
variable setting. To our knowledge, MISTR is the first non-parametric approach
for HTE estimation with unobserved confounders via instrumental variables.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01575v1,,False
Memento No More: Coaching AI Agents to Master Multiple Tasks via Hints Internalization,03/02/2025,"Minttu Alakuijala, Ya Gao, Georgy Ananov, Samuel Kaski, Pekka Marttinen, Alexander Ilin, Harri Valpola","As the general capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI) agents continue
to evolve, their ability to learn to master multiple complex tasks through
experience remains a key challenge. Current LLM agents, particularly those
based on proprietary language models, typically rely on prompts to incorporate
knowledge about the target tasks. This approach does not allow the agent to
internalize this information and instead relies on ever-expanding prompts to
sustain its functionality in diverse scenarios. This resembles a system of
notes used by a person affected by anterograde amnesia, the inability to form
new memories. In this paper, we propose a novel method to train AI agents to
incorporate knowledge and skills for multiple tasks without the need for either
cumbersome note systems or prior high-quality demonstration data. Our approach
employs an iterative process where the agent collects new experiences, receives
corrective feedback from humans in the form of hints, and integrates this
feedback into its weights via a context distillation training procedure. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by implementing it in a Llama-3-based
agent which, after only a few rounds of feedback, outperforms advanced models
GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 in a taskset requiring correct sequencing of information
retrieval, tool use, and question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01562v1,,False
Transformers trained on proteins can learn to attend to Euclidean distance,03/02/2025,"Isaac Ellmen, Constantin Schneider, Matthew I. J. Raybould, Charlotte M. Deane","While conventional Transformers generally operate on sequence data, they can
be used in conjunction with structure models, typically SE(3)-invariant or
equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs), for 3D applications such as protein
structure modelling. These hybrids typically involve either (1)
preprocessing/tokenizing structural features as input for Transformers or (2)
taking Transformer embeddings and processing them within a structural
representation. However, there is evidence that Transformers can learn to
process structural information on their own, such as the AlphaFold3 structural
diffusion model. In this work we show that Transformers can function
independently as structure models when passed linear embeddings of coordinates.
We first provide a theoretical explanation for how Transformers can learn to
filter attention as a 3D Gaussian with learned variance. We then validate this
theory using both simulated 3D points and in the context of masked token
prediction for proteins. Finally, we show that pre-training protein Transformer
encoders with structure improves performance on a downstream task, yielding
better performance than custom structural models. Together, this work provides
a basis for using standard Transformers as hybrid structure-language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01533v1,,False
Toward Task Generalization via Memory Augmentation in Meta-Reinforcement Learning,03/02/2025,"Kaixi Bao, Chenhao Li, Yarden As, Andreas Krause, Marco Hutter","In reinforcement learning (RL), agents often struggle to perform well on
tasks that differ from those encountered during training. This limitation
presents a challenge to the broader deployment of RL in diverse and dynamic
task settings. In this work, we introduce memory augmentation, a memory-based
RL approach to improve task generalization. Our approach leverages
task-structured augmentations to simulate plausible out-of-distribution
scenarios and incorporates memory mechanisms to enable context-aware policy
adaptation. Trained on a predefined set of tasks, our policy demonstrates the
ability to generalize to unseen tasks through memory augmentation without
requiring additional interactions with the environment. Through extensive
simulation experiments and real-world hardware evaluations on legged locomotion
tasks, we demonstrate that our approach achieves zero-shot generalization to
unseen tasks while maintaining robust in-distribution performance and high
sample efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01521v1,,False
Generalization Error Analysis for Selective State-Space Models Through the Lens of Attention,03/02/2025,"Arya Honarpisheh, Mustafa Bozdag, Mario Sznaier, Octavia Camps","State-space models (SSMs) are a new class of foundation models that have
emerged as a compelling alternative to Transformers and their attention
mechanisms for sequence processing tasks. This paper provides a detailed
theoretical analysis of selective SSMs, the core components of the Mamba and
Mamba-2 architectures. We leverage the connection between selective SSMs and
the self-attention mechanism to highlight the fundamental similarities between
these models. Building on this connection, we establish a length independent
covering number-based generalization bound for selective SSMs, providing a
deeper understanding of their theoretical performance guarantees. We analyze
the effects of state matrix stability and input-dependent discretization,
shedding light on the critical role played by these factors in the
generalization capabilities of selective SSMs. Finally, we empirically
demonstrate the sequence length independence of the derived bounds on two
tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01473v1,,False
Assessing the use of Diffusion models for motion artifact correction in brain MRI,03/02/2025,"Paolo Angella, Vito Paolo Pastore, Matteo Santacesaria","Magnetic Resonance Imaging generally requires long exposure times, while
being sensitive to patient motion, resulting in artifacts in the acquired
images, which may hinder their diagnostic relevance. Despite research efforts
to decrease the acquisition time, and designing efficient acquisition
sequences, motion artifacts are still a persistent problem, pushing toward the
need for the development of automatic motion artifact correction techniques.
Recently, diffusion models have been proposed as a solution for the task at
hand. While diffusion models can produce high-quality reconstructions, they are
also susceptible to hallucination, which poses risks in diagnostic
applications. In this study, we critically evaluate the use of diffusion models
for correcting motion artifacts in 2D brain MRI scans. Using a popular
benchmark dataset, we compare a diffusion model-based approach with
state-of-the-art methods consisting of Unets trained in a supervised fashion on
motion-affected images to reconstruct ground truth motion-free images. Our
findings reveal mixed results: diffusion models can produce accurate
predictions or generate harmful hallucinations in this context, depending on
data heterogeneity and the acquisition planes considered as input.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01418v1,,False
Accelerating Linear Recurrent Neural Networks for the Edge with Unstructured Sparsity,03/02/2025,"Alessandro Pierro, Steven Abreu, Jonathan Timcheck, Philipp Stratmann, Andreas Wild, Sumit Bam Shrestha","Linear recurrent neural networks enable powerful long-range sequence modeling
with constant memory usage and time-per-token during inference. These
architectures hold promise for streaming applications at the edge, but
deployment in resource-constrained environments requires hardware-aware
optimizations to minimize latency and energy consumption. Unstructured sparsity
offers a compelling solution, enabling substantial reductions in compute and
memory requirements--when accelerated by compatible hardware platforms. In this
paper, we conduct a scaling study to investigate the Pareto front of
performance and efficiency across inference compute budgets. We find that
highly sparse linear RNNs consistently achieve better efficiency-performance
trade-offs than dense baselines, with 2x less compute and 36% less memory at
iso-accuracy. Our models achieve state-of-the-art results on a real-time
streaming task for audio denoising. By quantizing our sparse models to
fixed-point arithmetic and deploying them on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic
chip for real-time processing, we translate model compression into tangible
gains of 42x lower latency and 149x lower energy consumption compared to a
dense model on an edge GPU. Our findings showcase the transformative potential
of unstructured sparsity, paving the way for highly efficient recurrent neural

DRL-based Dolph-Tschebyscheff Beamforming in Downlink Transmission for Mobile Users,03/02/2025,"Nancy Nayak, Kin K. Leung, Lajos Hanzo","With the emergence of AI technologies in next-generation communication
systems, machine learning plays a pivotal role due to its ability to address
high-dimensional, non-stationary optimization problems within dynamic
environments while maintaining computational efficiency. One such application
is directional beamforming, achieved through learning-based blind beamforming
techniques that utilize already existing radio frequency (RF) fingerprints of
the user equipment obtained from the base stations and eliminate the need for
additional hardware or channel and angle estimations. However, as the number of
users and antenna dimensions increase, thereby expanding the problem's
complexity, the learning process becomes increasingly challenging, and the
performance of the learning-based method cannot match that of the optimal
solution. In such a scenario, we propose a deep reinforcement learning-based
blind beamforming technique using a learnable Dolph-Tschebyscheff antenna array
that can change its beam pattern to accommodate mobile users. Our simulation
results show that the proposed method can support data rates very close to the
best possible values.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01278v1,,False
Compressed Image Generation with Denoising Diffusion Codebook Models,03/02/2025,"Guy Ohayon, Hila Manor, Tomer Michaeli, Michael Elad","We present a novel generative approach based on Denoising Diffusion Models
(DDMs), which produces high-quality image samples along with their losslessly
compressed bit-stream representations. This is obtained by replacing the
standard Gaussian noise sampling in the reverse diffusion with a selection of
noise samples from pre-defined codebooks of fixed iid Gaussian vectors.
Surprisingly, we find that our method, termed Denoising Diffusion Codebook
Model (DDCM), retains sample quality and diversity of standard DDMs, even for
extremely small codebooks. We leverage DDCM and pick the noises from the
codebooks that best match a given image, converting our generative model into a
highly effective lossy image codec achieving state-of-the-art perceptual image
compression results. More generally, by setting other noise selections rules,
we extend our compression method to any conditional image generation task
(e.g., image restoration), where the generated images are produced jointly with
their condensed bit-stream representations. Our work is accompanied by a
mathematical interpretation of the proposed compressed conditional generation
schemes, establishing a connection with score-based approximations of posterior

probabilities over sequence lengths, we link this skewness to the token
generation process, offering insights for estimating memorization and comparing
it to established metrics. Through theoretical analysis and empirical
evaluation, we provide a comprehensive understanding of memorization behaviors

MIND: Modality-Informed Knowledge Distillation Framework for Multimodal Clinical Prediction Tasks,03/02/2025,"Alejandro Guerra-Manzanares, Farah E. Shamout","Multimodal fusion leverages information across modalities to learn better
feature representations with the goal of improving performance in fusion-based
tasks. However, multimodal datasets, especially in medical settings, are
typically smaller than their unimodal counterparts, which can impede the
performance of multimodal models. Additionally, the increase in the number of
modalities is often associated with an overall increase in the size of the
multimodal network, which may be undesirable in medical use cases. Utilizing
smaller unimodal encoders may lead to sub-optimal performance, particularly
when dealing with high-dimensional clinical data. In this paper, we propose the
Modality-INformed knowledge Distillation (MIND) framework, a multimodal model
compression approach based on knowledge distillation that transfers knowledge
from ensembles of pre-trained deep neural networks of varying sizes into a
smaller multimodal student. The teacher models consist of unimodal networks,
allowing the student to learn from diverse representations. MIND employs
multi-head joint fusion models, as opposed to single-head models, enabling the
use of unimodal encoders in the case of unimodal samples without requiring
imputation or masking of absent modalities. As a result, MIND generates an
optimized multimodal model, enhancing both multimodal and unimodal
representations. It can also be leveraged to balance multimodal learning during
training. We evaluate MIND on binary and multilabel clinical prediction tasks
using time series data and chest X-ray images. Additionally, we assess the
generalizability of the MIND framework on three non-medical multimodal
multiclass datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MIND enhances the
performance of the smaller multimodal network across all five tasks, as well as
various fusion methods and multimodal architectures, compared to
state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01158v1,,False
Pushing the Boundaries of State Space Models for Image and Video Generation,03/02/2025,"Yicong Hong, Long Mai, Yuan Yao, Feng Liu","While Transformers have become the dominant architecture for visual
generation, linear attention models, such as the state-space models (SSM), are
increasingly recognized for their efficiency in processing long visual

formulating a limited recurrent state, enforcing causality among tokens that
are prone to inconsistent modeling of N-dimensional visual data, leaving
questions on their capacity to generate long non-causal sequences. In this
paper, we explore the boundary of SSM on image and video generation by building
the largest-scale diffusion SSM-Transformer hybrid model to date (5B
parameters) based on the sub-quadratic bi-directional Hydra and self-attention,
and generate up to 2K images and 360p 8 seconds (16 FPS) videos. Our results
