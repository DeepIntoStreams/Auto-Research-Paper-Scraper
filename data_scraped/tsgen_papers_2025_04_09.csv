FEABench: Evaluating Language Models on Multiphysics Reasoning Ability,08/04/2025,"Nayantara Mudur, Hao Cui, Subhashini Venugopalan, Paul Raccuglia, Michael P. Brenner, Peter Norgaard","Building precise simulations of the real world and invoking numerical solvers
to answer quantitative problems is an essential requirement in engineering and
science. We present FEABench, a benchmark to evaluate the ability of large
language models (LLMs) and LLM agents to simulate and solve physics,
mathematics and engineering problems using finite element analysis (FEA). We
introduce a comprehensive evaluation scheme to investigate the ability of LLMs
to solve these problems end-to-end by reasoning over natural language problem
descriptions and operating COMSOL Multiphysics$^\circledR$, an FEA software, to
compute the answers. We additionally design a language model agent equipped
with the ability to interact with the software through its Application
Programming Interface (API), examine its outputs and use tools to improve its
solutions over multiple iterations. Our best performing strategy generates
executable API calls 88% of the time. LLMs that can successfully interact with
and operate FEA software to solve problems such as those in our benchmark would
push the frontiers of automation in engineering. Acquiring this capability
would augment LLMs' reasoning skills with the precision of numerical solvers
and advance the development of autonomous systems that can tackle complex
problems in the real world. The code is available at

Can Performant LLMs Be Ethical? Quantifying the Impact of Web Crawling Opt-Outs,08/04/2025,"Dongyang Fan, Vinko Sabolƒçec, Matin Ansaripour, Ayush Kumar Tarun, Martin Jaggi, Antoine Bosselut, Imanol Schlag","The increasing adoption of web crawling opt-outs by copyright holders of
online content raises critical questions about the impact of data compliance on
large language model (LLM) performance. However, little is known about how
these restrictions (and the resultant filtering of pretraining datasets) affect
the capabilities of models trained using these corpora. In this work, we
conceptualize this effect as the $\textit{data compliance gap}$ (DCG), which
quantifies the performance difference between models trained on datasets that
comply with web crawling opt-outs, and those that do not. We measure the data
compliance gap in two settings: pretraining models from scratch and continual
pretraining from existing compliant models (simulating a setting where
copyrighted data could be integrated later in pretraining). Our experiments
with 1.5B models show that, as of January 2025, compliance with web data
opt-outs does not degrade general knowledge acquisition (close to 0\% DCG).
However, in specialized domains such as biomedical research, excluding major
publishers leads to performance declines. These findings suggest that while
general-purpose LLMs can be trained to perform equally well using fully open
data, performance in specialized domains may benefit from access to
high-quality copyrighted sources later in training. Our study provides
empirical insights into the long-debated trade-off between data compliance and
downstream model performance, informing future discussions on AI training
practices and policy decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06219v1,,False
From 128K to 4M: Efficient Training of Ultra-Long Context Large Language Models,08/04/2025,"Chejian Xu, Wei Ping, Peng Xu, Zihan Liu, Boxin Wang, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bo Li, Bryan Catanzaro","Long-context capabilities are essential for a wide range of applications,
including document and video understanding, in-context learning, and
inference-time scaling, all of which require models to process and reason over
long sequences of text and multimodal data. In this work, we introduce a
efficient training recipe for building ultra-long context LLMs from aligned
instruct model, pushing the boundaries of context lengths from 128K to 1M, 2M,
and 4M tokens. Our approach leverages efficient continued pretraining
strategies to extend the context window and employs effective instruction
tuning to maintain the instruction-following and reasoning abilities. Our
UltraLong-8B, built on Llama3.1-Instruct with our recipe, achieves
state-of-the-art performance across a diverse set of long-context benchmarks.
Importantly, models trained with our approach maintain competitive performance
on standard benchmarks, demonstrating balanced improvements for both long and
short context tasks. We further provide an in-depth analysis of key design
choices, highlighting the impacts of scaling strategies and data composition.
Our findings establish a robust framework for efficiently scaling context
lengths while preserving general model capabilities. We release all model
weights at: https://ultralong.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06214v1,,False
NNN: Next-Generation Neural Networks for Marketing Mix Modeling,08/04/2025,"Thomas Mulc, Mike Anderson, Paul Cubre, Huikun Zhang, Ivy Liu, Saket Kumar","We present NNN, a Transformer-based neural network approach to Marketing Mix
Modeling (MMM) designed to address key limitations of traditional methods.
Unlike conventional MMMs which rely on scalar inputs and parametric decay
functions, NNN uses rich embeddings to capture both quantitative and
qualitative aspects of marketing and organic channels (e.g., search queries, ad
creatives). This, combined with its attention mechanism, enables NNN to model
complex interactions, capture long-term effects, and potentially improve sales
attribution accuracy. We show that L1 regularization permits the use of such
expressive models in typical data-constrained settings. Evaluating NNN on
simulated and real-world data demonstrates its efficacy, particularly through
considerable improvement in predictive power. Beyond attribution, NNN provides
valuable, complementary insights through model probing, such as evaluating
keyword or creative effectiveness, enhancing model interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06212v1,,False
A Self-Supervised Framework for Space Object Behaviour Characterisation,08/04/2025,"Ian Groves, Andrew Campbell, James Fernandes, Diego Rodriguez, Paul Murray, Massimiliano Vasile, Victoria Nockles","Foundation Models, pre-trained on large unlabelled datasets before
task-specific fine-tuning, are increasingly being applied to specialised
domains. Recent examples include ClimaX for climate and Clay for satellite
Earth observation, but a Foundation Model for Space Object Behavioural Analysis
has not yet been developed. As orbital populations grow, automated methods for
characterising space object behaviour are crucial for space safety. We present
a Space Safety and Sustainability Foundation Model focusing on space object
behavioural analysis using light curves (LCs). We implemented a
Perceiver-Variational Autoencoder (VAE) architecture, pre-trained with
self-supervised reconstruction and masked reconstruction on 227,000 LCs from
the MMT-9 observatory. The VAE enables anomaly detection, motion prediction,
and LC generation. We fine-tuned the model for anomaly detection & motion
prediction using two independent LC simulators (CASSANDRA and GRIAL
respectively), using CAD models of boxwing, Sentinel-3, SMOS, and Starlink
platforms. Our pre-trained model achieved a reconstruction error of 0.01%,
identifying potentially anomalous light curves through reconstruction
difficulty. After fine-tuning, the model scored 88% and 82% accuracy, with 0.90
and 0.95 ROC AUC scores respectively in both anomaly detection and motion mode
prediction (sun-pointing, spin, etc.). Analysis of high-confidence anomaly
predictions on real data revealed distinct patterns including characteristic
object profiles and satellite glinting. Here, we demonstrate how
self-supervised learning can simultaneously enable anomaly detection, motion
prediction, and synthetic data generation from rich representations learned in
pre-training. Our work therefore supports space safety and sustainability
through automated monitoring and simulation capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06176v1,,False
Hall Effect Thruster Forecasting using a Topological Approach for Data Assimilation,08/04/2025,"Max M. Chumley, Firas A. Khasawneh","Hall Effect Thrusters (HETs) are electric thrusters that eject heavy ionized
gas particles from the spacecraft to generate thrust. Although traditionally
they were used for station keeping, recently They have been used for
interplanetary space missions due to their high delta-V potential and their
operational longevity in contrast to other thrusters, e.g., chemical. However,
the operation of HETs involves complex processes such as ionization of gases,
strong magnetic fields, and complicated solar panel power supply interactions.
Therefore, their operation is extremely difficult to model thus necessitating
Data Assimilation (DA) approaches for estimating and predicting their
operational states. Because HET's operating environment is often noisy with
non-Gaussian sources, this significantly limits applicable DA tools. We
describe a topological approach for data assimilation that bypasses these
limitations that does not depend on the noise model, and utilize it to forecast
spatiotemporal plume field states of HETs. Our approach is a generalization of
the Topological Approach for Data Assimilation (TADA) method that allows
including different forecast functions. We show how TADA can be combined with
the Long Short-Term Memory network for accurate forecasting. We then apply our
approach to high-fidelity Hall Effect Thruster (HET) simulation data from the
Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) rocket propulsion division where we
demonstrate the forecast resiliency of TADA on noise contaminated,
high-dimensional data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06157v1,,False
PINP: Physics-Informed Neural Predictor with latent estimation of fluid flows,08/04/2025,"Huaguan Chen, Yang Liu, Hao Sun","Accurately predicting fluid dynamics and evolution has been a long-standing
challenge in physical sciences. Conventional deep learning methods often rely
on the nonlinear modeling capabilities of neural networks to establish mappings
between past and future states, overlooking the fluid dynamics, or only
modeling the velocity field, neglecting the coupling of multiple physical
quantities. In this paper, we propose a new physics-informed learning approach
that incorporates coupled physical quantities into the prediction process to
assist with forecasting. Central to our method lies in the discretization of
physical equations, which are directly integrated into the model architecture
and loss function. This integration enables the model to provide robust,
long-term future predictions. By incorporating physical equations, our model
demonstrates temporal extrapolation and spatial generalization capabilities.
Experimental results show that our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance in spatiotemporal prediction across both numerical simulations and
real-world extreme-precipitation nowcasting benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06070v1,,False
Evaluation of the impact of expert knowledge: How decision support scores impact the effectiveness of automatic knowledge-driven feature engineering (aKDFE),08/04/2025,"Olof Bj√∂rneld, Tora Hammar, Daniel Nilsson, Alisa Lincke, Welf L√∂we","Adverse Drug Events (ADEs), harmful medication effects, pose significant
healthcare challenges, impacting patient safety and costs. This study evaluates
automatic Knowledge-Driven Feature Engineering (aKDFE) for improved ADE
prediction from Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, comparing it with
automated event-based Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD). We investigated
how incorporating domain-specific ADE risk scores for prolonged heart QT
interval, extracted from the Janusmed Riskprofile (Janusmed) Clinical Decision
Support System (CDSS), affects prediction performance using EHR data and
medication handling events. Results indicate that, while aKDFE step 1
(event-based feature generation) alone did not significantly improve ADE
prediction performance, aKDFE step 2 (patient-centric transformation) enhances
the prediction performance. High Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic curve (AUROC) values suggest strong feature correlations to the
outcome, aligning with the predictive power of patients' prior healthcare
history for ADEs. Statistical analysis did not confirm that incorporating the
Janusmed information (i) risk scores and (ii) medication route of
administration into the model's feature set enhanced predictive performance.
However, the patient-centric transformation applied by aKDFE proved to be a
highly effective feature engineering approach. Limitations include a
single-project focus, potential bias from machine learning pipeline methods,
and reliance on AUROC. In conclusion, aKDFE, particularly with patient-centric
transformation, improves ADE prediction from EHR data. Future work will explore
attention-based models, event feature sequences, and automatic methods for
incorporating domain knowledge into the aKDFE framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05928v1,,False
Physics-aware generative models for turbulent fluid flows through energy-consistent stochastic interpolants,08/04/2025,"Nikolaj T. M√ºcke, Benjamin Sanderse","Generative models have demonstrated remarkable success in domains such as
text, image, and video synthesis. In this work, we explore the application of
generative models to fluid dynamics, specifically for turbulence simulation,
where classical numerical solvers are computationally expensive. We propose a
novel stochastic generative model based on stochastic interpolants, which
enables probabilistic forecasting while incorporating physical constraints such
as energy stability and divergence-freeness. Unlike conventional stochastic
generative models, which are often agnostic to underlying physical laws, our
approach embeds energy consistency by making the parameters of the stochastic
interpolant learnable coefficients. We evaluate our method on a benchmark
turbulence problem - Kolmogorov flow - demonstrating superior accuracy and
stability over state-of-the-art alternatives such as autoregressive conditional
diffusion models (ACDMs) and PDE-Refiner. Furthermore, we achieve stable
results for significantly longer roll-outs than standard stochastic
interpolants. Our results highlight the potential of physics-aware generative
models in accelerating and enhancing turbulence simulations while preserving
fundamental conservation properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05852v1,,False
Video Flow as Time Series: Discovering Temporal Consistency and Variability for VideoQA,08/04/2025,"Zijie Song, Zhenzhen Hu, Yixiao Ma, Jia Li, Richang Hong","Video Question Answering (VideoQA) is a complex video-language task that
demands a sophisticated understanding of both visual content and temporal
dynamics. Traditional Transformer-style architectures, while effective in
integrating multimodal data, often simplify temporal dynamics through
positional encoding and fail to capture non-linear interactions within video
sequences. In this paper, we introduce the Temporal Trio Transformer (T3T), a
novel architecture that models time consistency and time variability. The T3T
integrates three key components: Temporal Smoothing (TS), Temporal Difference
(TD), and Temporal Fusion (TF). The TS module employs Brownian Bridge for
capturing smooth, continuous temporal transitions, while the TD module
identifies and encodes significant temporal variations and abrupt changes
within the video content. Subsequently, the TF module synthesizes these
temporal features with textual cues, facilitating a deeper contextual
understanding and response accuracy. The efficacy of the T3T is demonstrated
through extensive testing on multiple VideoQA benchmark datasets. Our results
underscore the importance of a nuanced approach to temporal modeling in
improving the accuracy and depth of video-based question answering.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05783v1,,False
DEL: Context-Aware Dynamic Exit Layer for Efficient Self-Speculative Decoding,08/04/2025,"Hossein Entezari Zarch, Lei Gao, Chaoyi Jiang, Murali Annavaram","Speculative Decoding (SD) is a widely used approach to accelerate the
inference of large language models (LLMs) without reducing generation quality.
It operates by first using a compact model to draft multiple tokens
efficiently, followed by parallel verification using the target LLM. This
approach leads to faster inference compared to auto-regressive decoding. While
there are multiple approaches to create a draft model, one promising approach
is to use early-exit methods. These methods draft candidate tokens by using a
subset of layers of the primary model and applying the remaining layers for
verification, allowing a single model to handle both drafting and verification.
While this technique reduces memory usage and computational cost, its
performance relies on the choice of the exit layer for drafting and the number
of tokens drafted (speculation length) in each SD round. Prior works use
hyperparameter exploration to statically select these values. However, our
evaluations show that these hyperparameter values are task-specific, and even
within a task they are dependent on the current sequence context. We introduce
DEL, a plug-and-play method that adaptively selects the exit layer and
speculation length during inference. DEL dynamically tracks the token
acceptance rate if the tokens are drafted at each layer of an LLM and uses that
knowledge to heuristically select the optimal exit layer and speculation
length. Our experiments across a broad range of models and downstream tasks
show that DEL achieves overall speedups of $2.16\times$$\sim$$2.50\times$ over
vanilla auto-regressive decoding and improves upon the state-of-the-art SD
methods by up to $0.27\times$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.05598v1,,False
