BLAZER: Bootstrapping LLM-based Manipulation Agents with Zero-Shot Data Generation,09/10/2025,"Rocktim Jyoti Das, Harsh Singh, Diana Turmakhan, Muhammad Abdullah Sohail, Mingfei Han, Preslav Nakov, Fabio Pizzati, Ivan Laptev","Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress
of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in
robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop
more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language,
robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic
tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically
suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this
problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies
from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot
capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for
diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to
finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human
supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's
state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based
manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly
improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments.
Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables
downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on
the project page.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08572v1,,False
Improving Reasoning for Diffusion Language Models via Group Diffusion Policy Optimization,09/10/2025,"Kevin Rojas, Jiahe Lin, Kashif Rasul, Anderson Schneider, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Molei Tao, Wei Deng","Diffusion language models (DLMs) enable parallel, order-agnostic generation
with iterative refinement, offering a flexible alternative to autoregressive
large language models (LLMs). However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL)
fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable
likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level
likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this
approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in
sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a
surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods
have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood
evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its
sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through
fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions.
Building on this insight, we introduce \textbf{Group Diffusion Policy
Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages
simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the
variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo
sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation
budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained
checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines,
on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08554v1,,False
To Sink or Not to Sink: Visual Information Pathways in Large Vision-Language Models,09/10/2025,"Jiayun Luo, Wan-Cyuan Fan, Lyuyang Wang, Xiangteng He, Tanzila Rahman, Purang Abolmaesumi, Leonid Sigal","Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful
architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and
textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a
Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual
content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end
-- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to
perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the
cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which
visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and
how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most
existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens
receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus
to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from
ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely
studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these
ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the
LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their
importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM
architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and
quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also
propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how
this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly
utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range
of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT
attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08510v1,,False
DexMan: Learning Bimanual Dexterous Manipulation from Human and Generated Videos,09/10/2025,"Jhen Hsieh, Kuan-Hsun Tu, Kuo-Han Hung, Tsung-Wei Ke","We present DexMan, an automated framework that converts human visual
demonstrations into bimanual dexterous manipulation skills for humanoid robots
in simulation. Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating
rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth
sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion
annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating
hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based
rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from
in-the-wild videos.
  DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the
TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD.
Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19%
in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both
real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and
costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse
datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08475v1,,False
Platform-Agnostic Modular Architecture for Quantum Benchmarking,09/10/2025,"Neer Patel, Anish Giri, Hrushikesh Pramod Patil, Noah Siekierski, Avimita Chatterjee, Sonika Johri, Timothy Proctor, Thomas Lubinski, Siyuan Niu","We present a platform-agnostic modular architecture that addresses the
increasingly fragmented landscape of quantum computing benchmarking by
decoupling problem generation, circuit execution, and results analysis into
independent, interoperable components. Supporting over 20 benchmark variants
ranging from simple algorithmic tests like Bernstein-Vazirani to complex
Hamiltonian simulation with observable calculations, the system integrates with
multiple circuit generation APIs (Qiskit, CUDA-Q, Cirq) and enables diverse
workflows. We validate the architecture through successful integration with
Sandia's $\textit{pyGSTi}$ for advanced circuit analysis and CUDA-Q for
multi-GPU HPC simulations. Extensibility of the system is demonstrated by
implementing dynamic circuit variants of existing benchmarks and a new quantum
reinforcement learning benchmark, which become readily available across
multiple execution and analysis modes. Our primary contribution is identifying
and formalizing modular interfaces that enable interoperability between
incompatible benchmarking frameworks, demonstrating that standardized
interfaces reduce ecosystem fragmentation while preserving optimization
flexibility. This architecture has been developed as a key enhancement to the
continually evolving QED-C Application-Oriented Performance Benchmarks for
Quantum Computing suite.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08469v1,,False
Wavefunction Flows: Efficient Quantum Simulation of Continuous Flow Models,09/10/2025,"David Layden, Ryan Sweke, Vojtěch Havlíček, Anirban Chowdhury, Kirill Neklyudov","Flow models are a cornerstone of modern machine learning. They are generative
models that progressively transform probability distributions according to
learned dynamics. Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process
that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples
from a complex target distribution. We show that these models are naturally
related to the Schr\""odinger equation, for an unusual Hamiltonian on continuous
variables. Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian
can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results
give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples)
for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by
flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem,
plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models,
such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum
algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical
algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results
reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models,
such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected
capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08462v1,,False
gLSTM: Mitigating Over-Squashing by Increasing Storage Capacity,09/10/2025,"Hugh Blayney, Álvaro Arroyo, Xiaowen Dong, Michael M. Bronstein","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit
information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism.
While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to
suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of
node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting
in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing
phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we
define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's
representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing
tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to
demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity.
Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on
associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a
novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong
performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well
as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08450v1,,False
Synthetic Series-Symbol Data Generation for Time Series Foundation Models,09/10/2025,"Wenxuan Wang, Kai Wu, Yujian Betterest Li, Dan Wang, Xiaoyu Zhang","Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as training data scarcity and imbalance
continue to hinder their development. Inspired by complex dynamic system
theories, we design a series-symbol data generation mechanism, enabling the
unrestricted creation of high-quality time series data paired with
corresponding symbolic expressions. To leverage series-symbol data pairs with
strong correlations, we develop \texttt{SymTime}, a pre-trained foundation
model for enhancing time series representation using symbolic information.
\texttt{SymTime} demonstrates competitive performance across five major TSA
tasks when fine-tunes with downstream tasks, rivaling foundation models
pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the potential of
series-symbol data generation and pretraining mechanisms in overcoming data
scarcity and enhancing task performance. The code is available at

"ClauseLens: Clause-Grounded, CVaR-Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Trustworthy Reinsurance Pricing",09/10/2025,"Stella C. Dong, James R. Finlay","Reinsurance treaty pricing must satisfy stringent regulatory standards, yet
current quoting practices remain opaque and difficult to audit. We introduce
ClauseLens, a clause-grounded reinforcement learning framework that produces
transparent, regulation-compliant, and risk-aware treaty quotes.
  ClauseLens models the quoting task as a Risk-Aware Constrained Markov
Decision Process (RA-CMDP). Statutory and policy clauses are retrieved from
legal and underwriting corpora, embedded into the agent's observations, and
used both to constrain feasible actions and to generate clause-grounded natural
language justifications.
  Evaluated in a multi-agent treaty simulator calibrated to industry data,
ClauseLens reduces solvency violations by 51%, improves tail-risk performance
by 27.9% (CVaR_0.10), and achieves 88.2% accuracy in clause-grounded
explanations with retrieval precision of 87.4% and recall of 91.1%.
  These findings demonstrate that embedding legal context into both decision
and explanation pathways yields interpretable, auditable, and
regulation-aligned quoting behavior consistent with Solvency II, NAIC RBC, and
the EU AI Act.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08429v1,10.1145/3768292.3770356,False
Learning What's Missing: Attention Dispersion and EMA Stabilization in Length Generalization,09/10/2025,"Pál Zsámboki, Benjamin Levi, David Ansel Josef Smith, Mitansh Kagalwala, Arlington Kell, Samuel Liechty, Cong Wang","We study length generalization in transformers through the set complement
task, where a model must predict a uniform distribution over tokens absent from
an input sequence -- an ability central to board-game style reasoning. Our main
theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on
embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers.
Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at
lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with
reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation:
as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding
separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a
second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We
hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving
Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random
hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both
mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random
Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this
more complex setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08341v1,,False
Bridging the Physics-Data Gap with FNO-Guided Conditional Flow Matching: Designing Inductive Bias through Hierarchical Physical Constraints,09/10/2025,Tsuyoshi Okita,"Conventional time-series generation often ignores domain-specific physical
constraints, limiting statistical and physical consistency. We propose a
hierarchical framework that embeds the inherent hierarchy of physical
laws-conservation, dynamics, boundary, and empirical relations-directly into
deep generative models, introducing a new paradigm of physics-informed
inductive bias. Our method combines Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) for
learning physical operators with Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) for
probabilistic generation, integrated via time-dependent hierarchical
constraints and FNO-guided corrections. Experiments on harmonic oscillators,
human activity recognition, and lithium-ion battery degradation show 16.3%

Multi-Agent Analysis of Off-Exchange Public Information for Cryptocurrency Market Trend Prediction,09/10/2025,"Kairan Hong, Jinling Gan, Qiushi Tian, Yanglinxuan Guo, Rui Guo, Runnan Li","Cryptocurrency markets present unique prediction challenges due to their
extreme volatility, 24/7 operation, and hypersensitivity to news events, with
existing approaches suffering from key information extraction and poor sideways
market detection critical for risk management. We introduce a
theoretically-grounded multi-agent cryptocurrency trend prediction framework
that advances the state-of-the-art through three key innovations: (1) an
information-preserving news analysis system with formal theoretical guarantees
that systematically quantifies market impact, regulatory implications, volume
dynamics, risk assessment, technical correlation, and temporal effects using
large language models; (2) an adaptive volatility-conditional fusion mechanism
with proven optimal properties that dynamically combines news sentiment and
technical indicators based on market regime detection; (3) a distributed
multi-agent coordination architecture with low communication complexity
enabling real-time processing of heterogeneous data streams. Comprehensive
experimental evaluation on Bitcoin across three prediction horizons
demonstrates statistically significant improvements over state-of-the-art
natural language processing baseline, establishing a new paradigm for financial

Expressive Value Learning for Scalable Offline Reinforcement Learning,09/10/2025,"Nicolas Espinosa-Dice, Kiante Brantley, Wen Sun","Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make
sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics,
principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising
avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly
real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly
complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and
flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either
backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or
policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability
to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to
develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or
backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for
Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that
integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns
an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At
inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection
sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient
optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining.
Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of
offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value
learning into offline RL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08218v1,,False
Bidirectional Representations Augmented Autoregressive Biological Sequence Generation:Application in De Novo Peptide Sequencing,09/10/2025,"Xiang Zhang, Jiaqi Wei, Zijie Qiu, Sheng Xu, Zhi Jin, ZhiQiang Gao, Nanqing Dong, Siqi Sun","Autoregressive (AR) models, common in sequence generation, are limited in
many biological tasks such as de novo peptide sequencing and protein modeling
by their unidirectional nature, failing to capture crucial global bidirectional
token dependencies. Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic,
bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and
scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR
generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from
non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with
two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological
features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging
these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables
the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features,
enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training
strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder
gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding
nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model
substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR
stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior
performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological
sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for
augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex
sequence generation. Code is available at https://github.com/BEAM-Labs/denovo.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08169v1,,False
VersionRAG: Version-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Evolving Documents,09/10/2025,"Daniel Huwiler, Kurt Stockinger, Jonathan Fürst","Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems fail when documents evolve
through versioning-a ubiquitous characteristic of technical documentation.
Existing approaches achieve only 58-64% accuracy on version-sensitive

models document evolution through a hierarchical graph structure capturing
version sequences, content boundaries, and changes between document states.
During retrieval, VersionRAG routes queries through specialized paths based on
intent classification, enabling precise version-aware filtering and change
tracking. On our VersionQA benchmark-100 manually curated questions across 34
versioned technical documents-VersionRAG achieves 90% accuracy, outperforming
naive RAG (58%) and GraphRAG (64%). VersionRAG reaches 60% accuracy on implicit
change detection where baselines fail (0-10%), demonstrating its ability to

Lossless Vocabulary Reduction for Auto-Regressive Language Models,09/10/2025,"Daiki Chijiwa, Taku Hasegawa, Kyosuke Nishida, Shin'ya Yamaguchi, Tomoya Ohba, Tamao Sakao, Susumu Takeuchi","Tokenization -- the process of decomposing a given text into a sequence of
subwords called tokens -- is one of the key components in the development of
language models. Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts
token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the
previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text
generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of
possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of
next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a
theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently
converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an
arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application,
we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate
with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.08102v1,,False
LinguaSim: Interactive Multi-Vehicle Testing Scenario Generation via Natural Language Instruction Based on Large Language Models,09/10/2025,"Qingyuan Shi, Qingwen Meng, Hao Cheng, Qing Xu, Jianqiang Wang","The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has
drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled
new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command
adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To
reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism
by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles
follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an
LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive
3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment
between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback
calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity
to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop,
interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors
using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding
them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that
enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate
scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language
descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions;
comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces

VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in
realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken

Executable Analytic Concepts as the Missing Link Between VLM Insight and Precise Manipulation,09/10/2025,"Mingyang Sun, Jiude Wei, Qichen He, Donglin Wang, Cewu Lu, Jianhua Sun","Enabling robots to perform precise and generalized manipulation in

introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through
executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that
encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of
manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline
that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an
instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan
physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides
a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction

spatiotemporal layouts during inference for better text-image alignment. Rather
than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work,
we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention
objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming

Towards Human-Like Grading: A Unified LLM-Enhanced Framework for Subjective Question Evaluation,09/10/2025,"Fanwei Zhua, Jiaxuan He, Xiaoxiao Chen, Zulong Chen, Quan Lu, Chenrui Mei","Automatic grading of subjective questions remains a significant challenge in
examination assessment due to the diversity in question formats and the

leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1)
compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers,
(2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance
to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying
content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments

DM1: MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for 1-Step Robotic Manipulation,09/10/2025,"Guowei Zou, Haitao Wang, Hejun Wu, Yukun Qian, Yuhang Wang, Weibing Li","The ability to learn multi-modal action distributions is indispensable for
robotic manipulation policies to perform precise and robust control. Flow-based
generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning
distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus
achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods.
However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the
inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in
precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive
Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching
framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent
collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive
regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers,
encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing
additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on
RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s

Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment
on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from
simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based
policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a
simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07865v1,,False
Augur: Modeling Covariate Causal Associations in Time Series via Large Language Models,09/10/2025,"Zhiqing Cui, Binwu Wang, Qingxiang Liu, Yeqiang Wang, Zhengyang Zhou, Yuxuan Liang, Yang Wang","Large language models (LLM) have emerged as a promising avenue for time
series forecasting, offering the potential to integrate multimodal data.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations-such as
marginalized role in model architectures, reliance on coarse statistical text
prompts, and lack of interpretability. In this work, we introduce Augur, a
fully LLM driven time series forecasting framework that exploits LLM causal
reasoning to discover and use directed causal associations among covariates.
Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher
LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search
together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then
refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are
encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves
predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about
variable interactions. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets with 25
baselines demonstrate that Augur achieves competitive performance and robust
zero-shot generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07858v1,,False
Strategic Communication under Threat: Learning Information Trade-offs in Pursuit-Evasion Games,09/10/2025,"Valerio La Gatta, Dolev Mutzari, Sarit Kraus, VS Subrahmanian","Adversarial environments require agents to navigate a key strategic
trade-off: acquiring information enhances situational awareness, but may
simultaneously expose them to threats. To investigate this tension, we
formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer
agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position.
Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being
targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning,
while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances
observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid
Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed
sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous
navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for
behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve
higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study
confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for
effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the
learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and
physical asymmetries between agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07813v1,,False
PLUM: Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for Industrial-scale Generative Recommendations,09/10/2025,"Ruining He, Lukasz Heldt, Lichan Hong, Raghunandan Keshavan, Shifan Mao, Nikhil Mehta, Zhengyang Su, Alicia Tsai, Yueqi Wang, Shao-Chuan Wang, Xinyang Yi, Lexi Baugher, Baykal Cakici, Ed Chi, Cristos Goodrow, Ningren Han, He Ma, Romer Rosales, Abby Van Soest, Devansh Tandon, Su-Lin Wu, Weilong Yang, Yilin Zheng","Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a new paradigm of modeling and computation
for information tasks. Recommendation systems are a critical application domain
poised to benefit significantly from the sequence modeling capabilities and
world knowledge inherent in these large models. In this paper, we introduce
PLUM, a framework designed to adapt pre-trained LLMs for industry-scale
recommendation tasks. PLUM consists of item tokenization using Semantic IDs,
continued pre-training (CPT) on domain-specific data, and task-specific
fine-tuning for recommendation objectives. For fine-tuning, we focus
particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to
generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context. We conduct
comprehensive experiments on large-scale internal video recommendation
datasets. Our results demonstrate that PLUM achieves substantial improvements
for retrieval compared to a heavily-optimized production model built with large
embedding tables. We also present a scaling study for the model's retrieval
performance, our learnings about CPT, a few enhancements to Semantic IDs, along
with an overview of the training and inference methods that enable launching
this framework to billions of users in YouTube.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07784v1,,False
Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer,09/10/2025,"YuHang Tang, Yixuan Lou, Pengfei Han, Haoming Song, Xinyi Ye, Dong Wang, Bin Zhao","Learning manipulation skills from human demonstration videos presents a
promising yet challenging problem, primarily due to the significant embodiment
gap between human body and robot manipulators. Existing methods rely on paired
datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization.
We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment
Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from
human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as
sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion
cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics.
Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs,
TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos
and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment
skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on
simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\% and KVD
by 36.6\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment
success rate by up to 16.7\%. Real-robot experiments in kitchen manipulation
tasks further validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating
practical human-to-robot skill transfer across embodiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07773v1,,False
A Unified Multi-Task Learning Framework for Generative Auto-Bidding with Validation-Aligned Optimization,09/10/2025,"Yiqin Lv, Zhiyu Mou, Miao Xu, Jinghao Chen, Qi Wang, Yixiu Mao, Yun Qu, Rongquan Bai, Chuan Yu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng, Xiangyang Ji","In online advertising, heterogeneous advertiser requirements give rise to
numerous customized bidding tasks that are typically optimized independently,
resulting in extensive computation and limited data efficiency. Multi-task
learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through
shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies
are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in
volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned
Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on
the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation
gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better
matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a
periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative
auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and
strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into
the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis.
Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising
systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical
baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07760v1,,False
GeoGen: A Two-stage Coarse-to-Fine Framework for Fine-grained Synthetic Location-based Social Network Trajectory Generation,09/10/2025,"Rongchao Xu, Kunlin Cai, Lin Jiang, Dahai Yu, Zhiqing Hong, Yuan Tian, Guang Wang","Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important
for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and
pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing
privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data.
The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new
opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic
data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy
protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains
challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and
the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain
human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage
coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation.
In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular
latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then
design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an
efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In
the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq
architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder
and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN
trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling
semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four
real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both
fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in
distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07735v1,,False
Rotated Mean-Field Variational Inference and Iterative Gaussianization,09/10/2025,"Yifan Chen, Sifan Liu","We propose to perform mean-field variational inference (MFVI) in a rotated
coordinate system that reduces correlations between variables. The rotation is
determined by principal component analysis (PCA) of a cross-covariance matrix
involving the target's score function. Compared with standard MFVI along the
original axes, MFVI in this rotated system often yields substantially more
accurate approximations with negligible additional cost.
  MFVI in a rotated coordinate system defines a rotation and a coordinatewise
map that together move the target closer to Gaussian. Iterating this procedure
yields a sequence of transformations that progressively transforms the target
toward Gaussian. The resulting algorithm provides a computationally efficient
way to construct flow-like transport maps: it requires only MFVI subproblems,
avoids large-scale optimization, and yields transformations that are easy to
invert and evaluate. In Bayesian inference tasks, we demonstrate that the
proposed method achieves higher accuracy than standard MFVI, while maintaining
much lower computational cost than conventional normalizing flows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07732v1,,False
Multimodal Safety Evaluation in Generative Agent Social Simulations,09/10/2025,"Alhim Vera, Karen Sanchez, Carlos Hinojosa, Haidar Bin Hamid, Donghoon Kim, Bernard Ghanem","Can generative agents be trusted in multimodal environments? Despite advances
in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act
autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about
safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a
reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions:
(1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in
text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple
categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as
interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are
equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are
instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics
that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information
diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct
multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global
safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans.
Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and
Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75,
55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in
multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such
as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted
when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust
images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and
provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and
social dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07709v1,,False
Controllable Video Synthesis via Variational Inference,09/10/2025,"Haoyi Duan, Yunzhi Zhang, Yilun Du, Jiajun Wu","Many video workflows benefit from a mixture of user controls with varying
granularity, from exact 4D object trajectories and camera paths to coarse text
prompts, while existing video generative models are typically trained for fixed
input formats. We develop a video synthesis method that addresses this need and
generates samples with high controllability for specified elements while
maintaining diversity for under-specified ones. We cast the task as variational
inference to approximate a composed distribution, leveraging multiple video
generation backbones to account for all task constraints collectively. To
address the optimization challenge, we break down the problem into step-wise KL
divergence minimization over an annealed sequence of distributions, and further
propose a context-conditioned factorization technique that reduces modes in the
solution space to circumvent local optima. Experiments suggest that our method
produces samples with improved controllability, diversity, and 3D consistency

IKNet: Interpretable Stock Price Prediction via Keyword-Guided Integration of News and Technical Indicators,09/10/2025,"Jinwoong Kim, Sangjin Park","The increasing influence of unstructured external information, such as news
articles, on stock prices has attracted growing attention in financial markets.
Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent
all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the
general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of
the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we
propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an
explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between
individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies
salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding
through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their
representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast
next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model
generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of
each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to
2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural
networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving
cumulative returns by 18.5%. Moreover, IKNet enhances transparency by offering
contextualized explanations of volatility events driven by public sentiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.07661v1,,False
