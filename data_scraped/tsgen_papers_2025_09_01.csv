"Neural Network Acceleration on MPSoC board: Integrating SLAC's SNL, Rogue Software and Auto-SNL",29/08/2025,"Hamza Ezzaoui Rahali, Abhilasha Dave, Larry Ruckman, Mohammad Mehdi Rahimifar, Audrey C. Therrien, James J. Russel, Ryan T. Herbst","The LCLS-II Free Electron Laser (FEL) will generate X-ray pulses for beamline
experiments at rates of up to 1~MHz, with detectors producing data throughputs
exceeding 1 TB/s. Managing such massive data streams presents significant
challenges, as transmission and storage infrastructures become prohibitively
expensive. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising solution for real-time data
reduction, but conventional implementations introduce excessive latency, making
them unsuitable for high-speed experimental environments. To address these
challenges, SLAC developed the SLAC Neural Network Library (SNL), a specialized
framework designed to deploy real-time ML inference models on
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). SNL's key feature is the ability to
dynamically update model weights without requiring FPGA resynthesis, enhancing
flexibility for adaptive learning applications. To further enhance usability
and accessibility, we introduce Auto-SNL, a Python extension that streamlines
the process of converting Python-based neural network models into
SNL-compatible high-level synthesis code. This paper presents a benchmark
comparison against hls4ml, the current state-of-the-art tool, across multiple
neural network architectures, fixed-point precisions, and synthesis
configurations targeting a Xilinx ZCU102 FPGA. The results showed that SNL
achieves competitive or superior latency in most tested architectures, while in
some cases also offering FPGA resource savings. This adaptation demonstrates
SNL's versatility, opening new opportunities for researchers and academics in
fields such as high-energy physics, medical imaging, robotics, and many more.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21739v1,,False
Freeze and Conquer: Reusable Ansatz for Solving the Traveling Salesman Problem,29/08/2025,"Fabrizio Fagiolo, Nicolo' Vescera","In this paper we present a variational algorithm for the Traveling Salesman
Problem (TSP) that combines (i) a compact encoding of permutations, which
reduces the qubit requirement too, (ii) an optimize-freeze-reuse strategy:
where the circuit topology (``Ansatz'') is first optimized on a training
instance by Simulated Annealing (SA), then ``frozen'' and re-used on novel
instances, limited to a rapid re-optimization of only the circuit parameters.
This pipeline eliminates costly structural research in testing, making the
procedure immediately implementable on NISQ hardware.
  On a set of $40$ randomly generated symmetric instances that span $4 - 7$
cities, the resulting Ansatz achieves an average optimal trip sampling
probability of $100\%$ for 4 city cases, $90\%$ for 5 city cases and $80\%$ for
6 city cases. With 7 cities the success rate drops markedly to an average of
$\sim 20\%$, revealing the onset of scalability limitations of the proposed
method.
  The results show robust generalization ability for moderate problem sizes and
indicate how freezing the Ansatz can dramatically reduce time-to-solution
without degrading solution quality. The paper also discusses scalability
limitations, the impact of ``warm-start'' initialization of parameters, and
prospects for extension to more complex problems, such as Vehicle Routing and
Job-Shop Scheduling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21730v1,,False
Surface Stability Modeling with Universal Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials: A Comprehensive Cleavage Energy Benchmarking Study,29/08/2025,"Ardavan Mehdizadeh, Peter Schindler","Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have revolutionized
computational materials science by bridging the gap between quantum mechanical
accuracy and classical simulation efficiency, enabling unprecedented
exploration of materials properties across the periodic table. Despite their
remarkable success in predicting bulk properties, no systematic evaluation has
assessed how well these universal MLIPs (uMLIPs) can predict cleavage energies,
a critical property governing fracture, catalysis, surface stability, and
interfacial phenomena. Here, we present a comprehensive benchmark of 19
state-of-the-art uMLIPs for cleavage energy prediction using our previously
established density functional theory (DFT) database of 36,718 slab structures
spanning elemental, binary, and ternary metallic compounds. We evaluate diverse
architectural paradigms, analyzing their performance across chemical
compositions, crystal systems, thickness, and surface orientations. Our results
reveal that training data composition dominates architectural sophistication:
models trained on the Open Materials 2024 (OMat24) dataset, which emphasizes
non-equilibrium configurations, achieve mean absolute percentage errors below
6% and correctly identify the thermodynamically most stable surface
terminations in 87% of cases, without any explicit surface energy training. In
contrast, architecturally identical models trained on equilibrium-only datasets
show five-fold higher errors, while models trained on surface-adsorbate data
fail catastrophically with a 17-fold degradation. Remarkably, simpler
architectures trained on appropriate data achieve comparable accuracy to
complex transformers while offering 10-100x computational speedup. These
findings show that the community should focus on strategic training data
generation that captures the relevant physical phenomena.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21663v1,,False
Integrating Large Language Models with Network Optimization for Interactive and Explainable Supply Chain Planning: A Real-World Case Study,29/08/2025,Saravanan Venkatachalam,"This paper presents an integrated framework that combines traditional network
optimization models with large language models (LLMs) to deliver interactive,
explainable, and role-aware decision support for supply chain planning. The
proposed system bridges the gap between complex operations research outputs and
business stakeholder understanding by generating natural language summaries,
contextual visualizations, and tailored key performance indicators (KPIs). The
core optimization model addresses tactical inventory redistribution across a
network of distribution centers for multi-period and multi-item, using a
mixed-integer formulation. The technical architecture incorporates AI agents,
RESTful APIs, and a dynamic user interface to support real-time interaction,
configuration updates, and simulation-based insights. A case study demonstrates
how the system improves planning outcomes by preventing stockouts, reducing
costs, and maintaining service levels. Future extensions include integrating
private LLMs, transfer learning, reinforcement learning, and Bayesian neural
networks to enhance explainability, adaptability, and real-time
decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21622v1,,False
Binary Weight Multi-Bit Activation Quantization for Compute-in-Memory CNN Accelerators,29/08/2025,"Wenyong Zhou, Zhengwu Liu, Yuan Ren, Ngai Wong","Compute-in-memory (CIM) accelerators have emerged as a promising way for
enhancing the energy efficiency of convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
Deploying CNNs on CIM platforms generally requires quantization of network
weights and activations to meet hardware constraints. However, existing
approaches either prioritize hardware efficiency with binary weight and
activation quantization at the cost of accuracy, or utilize multi-bit weights
and activations for greater accuracy but limited efficiency. In this paper, we
introduce a novel binary weight multi-bit activation (BWMA) method for CNNs on
CIM-based accelerators. Our contributions include: deriving closed-form
solutions for weight quantization in each layer, significantly improving the
representational capabilities of binarized weights; and developing a
differentiable function for activation quantization, approximating the ideal
multi-bit function while bypassing the extensive search for optimal settings.
Through comprehensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets, we show
that BWMA achieves notable accuracy improvements over existing methods,
registering gains of 1.44\%-5.46\% and 0.35\%-5.37\% on respective datasets.
Moreover, hardware simulation results indicate that 4-bit activation
quantization strikes the optimal balance between hardware cost and model
performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21524v1,,False
"Spiking Decision Transformers: Local Plasticity, Phase-Coding, and Dendritic Routing for Low-Power Sequence Control",29/08/2025,"Vishal Pandey, Debasmita Biswas","Reinforcement learning agents based on Transformer architectures have
achieved impressive performance on sequential decision-making tasks, but their
reliance on dense matrix operations makes them ill-suited for
energy-constrained, edge-oriented platforms. Spiking neural networks promise
ultra-low-power, event-driven inference, yet no prior work has seamlessly
merged spiking dynamics with return-conditioned sequence modeling. We present
the Spiking Decision Transformer (SNN-DT), which embeds Leaky
Integrate-and-Fire neurons into each self-attention block, trains end-to-end
via surrogate gradients, and incorporates biologically inspired three-factor
plasticity, phase-shifted spike-based positional encodings, and a lightweight
dendritic routing module. Our implementation matches or exceeds standard
Decision Transformer performance on classic control benchmarks (CartPole-v1,
MountainCar-v0, Acrobot-v1, Pendulum-v1) while emitting fewer than ten spikes
per decision, an energy proxy suggesting over four orders-of-magnitude
reduction in per inference energy. By marrying sequence modeling with
neuromorphic efficiency, SNN-DT opens a pathway toward real-time, low-power
control on embedded and wearable devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21505v1,,False
Data-driven Discovery of Digital Twins in Biomedical Research,29/08/2025,"Clémence Métayer, Annabelle Ballesta, Julien Martinelli","Recent technological advances have expanded the availability of
high-throughput biological datasets, enabling the reliable design of digital
twins of biomedical systems or patients. Such computational tools represent key
reaction networks driving perturbation or drug response and can guide drug
discovery and personalized therapeutics. Yet, their development still relies on
laborious data integration by the human modeler, so that automated approaches
are critically needed. The success of data-driven system discovery in Physics,
rooted in clean datasets and well-defined governing laws, has fueled interest
in applying similar techniques in Biology, which presents unique challenges.
Here, we reviewed methodologies for automatically inferring digital twins from
biological time series, which mostly involve symbolic or sparse regression. We
evaluate algorithms according to eight biological and methodological
challenges, associated to noisy/incomplete data, multiple conditions, prior
knowledge integration, latent variables, high dimensionality, unobserved
variable derivatives, candidate library design, and uncertainty quantification.
Upon these criteria, sparse regression generally outperformed symbolic
regression, particularly when using Bayesian frameworks. We further highlight
the emerging role of deep learning and large language models, which enable
innovative prior knowledge integration, though the reliability and consistency
of such approaches must be improved. While no single method addresses all
challenges, we argue that progress in learning digital twins will come from
hybrid and modular frameworks combining chemical reaction network-based
mechanistic grounding, Bayesian uncertainty quantification, and the generative
and knowledge integration capacities of deep learning. To support their
development, we further propose a benchmarking framework to evaluate methods
across all challenges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21484v1,,False
Beyond expected value: geometric mean optimization for long-term policy performance in reinforcement learning,29/08/2025,"Xinyi Sheng, Dominik Baumann","Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms typically optimize the expected
cumulative reward, i.e., the expected value of the sum of scalar rewards an
agent receives over the course of a trajectory. The expected value averages the
performance over an infinite number of trajectories. However, when deploying
the agent in the real world, this ensemble average may be uninformative for the
performance of individual trajectories. Thus, in many applications, optimizing
the long-term performance of individual trajectories might be more desirable.
In this work, we propose a novel RL algorithm that combines the standard
ensemble average with the time-average growth rate, a measure for the long-term
performance of individual trajectories. We first define the Bellman operator
for the time-average growth rate. We then show that, under multiplicative
reward dynamics, the geometric mean aligns with the time-average growth rate.
To address more general and unknown reward dynamics, we propose a modified
geometric mean with $N$-sliding window that captures the path-dependency as an
estimator for the time-average growth rate. This estimator is embedded as a
regularizer into the objective, forming a practical algorithm and enabling the
policy to benefit from ensemble average and time-average simultaneously. We
evaluate our algorithm in challenging simulations, where it outperforms
conventional RL methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21443v1,,False
Quantum enhanced ensemble GANs for anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing,29/08/2025,"Rajiv Kailasanathan, William R. Clements, Mohammad Reza Boskabadi, Shawn M. Gibford, Emmanouil Papadakis, Christopher J. Savoie, Seyed Soheil Mansouri","The development of continuous biomanufacturing processes requires robust and
early anomaly detection, since even minor deviations can compromise yield and
stability, leading to disruptions in scheduling, reduced weekly production, and
diminished economic performance. These processes are inherently complex and
exhibit non-linear dynamics with intricate relationships between process
variables, thus making advanced methods for anomaly detection essential for
efficient operation. In this work, we present a novel framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in continuous biomanufacturing based on an
ensemble of generative adversarial networks (GANs). We first establish a
benchmark dataset simulating both normal and anomalous operation regimes in a
continuous process for the production of a small molecule. We then demonstrate
the effectiveness of our GAN-based framework in detecting anomalies caused by
sudden feedstock variability. Finally, we evaluate the impact of using a hybrid
quantum/classical GAN approach with both a simulated quantum circuit and a real
photonic quantum processor on anomaly detection performance. We find that the
hybrid approach yields improved anomaly detection rates. Our work shows the
potential of hybrid quantum/classical approaches for solving real-world
problems in complex continuous biomanufacturing processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21438v1,,False
CARJAN: Agent-Based Generation and Simulation of Traffic Scenarios with AJAN,29/08/2025,"Leonard Frank Neis, Andre Antakli, Matthias Klusch","User-friendly modeling and virtual simulation of urban traffic scenarios with
different types of interacting agents such as pedestrians, cyclists and
autonomous vehicles remains a challenge. We present CARJAN, a novel tool for
semi-automated generation and simulation of such scenarios based on the
multi-agent engineering framework AJAN and the driving simulator CARLA. CARJAN
provides a visual user interface for the modeling, storage and maintenance of
traffic scenario layouts, and leverages SPARQL Behavior Tree-based
decision-making and interactions for agents in dynamic scenario simulations in

RoboInspector: Unveiling the Unreliability of Policy Code for LLM-enabled Robotic Manipulation,29/08/2025,"Chenduo Ying, Linkang Du, Peng Cheng, Yuanchao Shu","Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities in reasoning
and code generation, enabling robotic manipulation to be initiated with just a
single instruction. The LLM carries out various tasks by generating policy code
required to control the robot. Despite advances in LLMs, achieving reliable
policy code generation remains a significant challenge due to the diverse
requirements of real-world tasks and the inherent complexity of user
instructions. In practice, different users may provide distinct instructions to
drive the robot for the same task, which may cause the unreliability of policy
code generation. To bridge this gap, we design RoboInspector, a pipeline to
unveil and characterize the unreliability of the policy code for LLM-enabled
robotic manipulation from two perspectives: the complexity of the manipulation
task and the granularity of the instruction. We perform comprehensive
experiments with 168 distinct combinations of tasks, instructions, and LLMs in
two prominent frameworks. The RoboInspector identifies four main unreliable
behaviors that lead to manipulation failure. We provide a detailed
characterization of these behaviors and their underlying causes, giving insight
for practical development to reduce unreliability. Furthermore, we introduce a
refinement approach guided by failure policy code feedback that improves the
reliability of policy code generation by up to 35% in LLM-enabled robotic
manipulation, evaluated in both simulation and real-world environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21378v1,,False
EconAgentic in DePIN Markets: A Large Language Model Approach to the Sharing Economy of Decentralized Physical Infrastructure,29/08/2025,"Yulin Liu, Mocca Schweitzer","The Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) market is revolutionizing
the sharing economy through token-based economics and smart contracts that
govern decentralized operations. By 2024, DePIN projects have exceeded \$10
billion in market capitalization, underscoring their rapid growth. However, the
unregulated nature of these markets, coupled with the autonomous deployment of
AI agents in smart contracts, introduces risks such as inefficiencies and
potential misalignment with human values. To address these concerns, we
introduce EconAgentic, a Large Language Model (LLM)-powered framework designed
to mitigate these challenges. Our research focuses on three key areas: 1)
modeling the dynamic evolution of DePIN markets, 2) evaluating stakeholders'
actions and their economic impacts, and 3) analyzing macroeconomic indicators
to align market outcomes with societal goals. Through EconAgentic, we simulate
how AI agents respond to token incentives, invest in infrastructure, and adapt
to market conditions, comparing AI-driven decisions with human heuristic
benchmarks. Our results show that EconAgentic provides valuable insights into
the efficiency, inclusion, and stability of DePIN markets, contributing to both
academic understanding and practical improvements in the design and governance
of decentralized, tokenized economies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21368v1,,False
DLGAN : Time Series Synthesis Based on Dual-Layer Generative Adversarial Networks,29/08/2025,"Xuan Hou, Shuhan Liu, Zhaohui Peng, Yaohui Chu, Yue Zhang, Yining Wang","Time series synthesis is an effective approach to ensuring the secure
circulation of time series data. Existing time series synthesis methods
typically perform temporal modeling based on random sequences to generate
target sequences, which often struggle to ensure the temporal dependencies in
the generated time series. Additionally, directly modeling temporal features on
random sequences makes it challenging to accurately capture the feature
information of the original time series. To address the above issues, we
propose a simple but effective generative model \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{L}ayer
\textbf{G}enerative \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{N}etworks, named
\textbf{DLGAN}. The model decomposes the time series generation process into
two stages: sequence feature extraction and sequence reconstruction. First,
these two stages form a complete time series autoencoder, enabling supervised
learning on the original time series to ensure that the reconstruction process
can restore the temporal dependencies of the sequence. Second, a Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) is used to generate synthetic feature vectors that
align with the real-time sequence feature vectors, ensuring that the generator
can capture the temporal features from real time series. Extensive experiments
on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of this model across
various evaluation metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21340v1,,False
Quantum-Enhanced Natural Language Generation: A Multi-Model Framework with Hybrid Quantum-Classical Architectures,29/08/2025,"Chi-Sheng Chen, En-Jui Kuo","This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation of quantum text generation
models against traditional Transformer/MLP architectures, addressing the
growing interest in quantum computing applications for natural language
processing. We conduct systematic experiments comparing five distinct models:
Transformer (baseline), Quantum Kernel Self-Attention Network (QKSAN), Quantum
RWKV (QRWKV), and Quantum Attention Sequence Architecture (QASA) across five
diverse datasets including simple sentences, short stories, quantum phrases,
haiku poetry, and proverbs. Our evaluation employs multiple metrics including
perplexity, BLEU scores, vocabulary diversity, repetition rates, and fluency
measures to assess different aspects of text generation quality. The
experimental results reveal that while traditional Transformer models maintain
overall superiority with the lowest average perplexity (1.21) and highest
BLEU-1 score (0.2895), quantum-inspired models demonstrate competitive
performance in specific scenarios. Notably, QKSAN achieves a competitive BLEU-1
score of 0.2800 while maintaining zero repetition rates, and QRWKV demonstrates
perfect vocabulary diversity (Distinct-1 = 1.000) in certain tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21332v1,,False
Stage-Diff: Stage-wise Long-Term Time Series Generation Based on Diffusion Models,29/08/2025,"Xuan Hou, Shuhan Liu, Zhaohui Peng, Yaohui Chu, Yue Zhang, Yining Wang","Generative models have been successfully used in the field of time series
generation. However, when dealing with long-term time series, which span over
extended periods and exhibit more complex long-term temporal patterns, the task
of generation becomes significantly more challenging. Long-term time series
exhibit long-range temporal dependencies, but their data distribution also
undergoes gradual changes over time. Finding a balance between these long-term
dependencies and the drift in data distribution is a key challenge. On the
other hand, long-term time series contain more complex interrelationships
between different feature sequences, making the task of effectively capturing
both intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies another important
challenge. To address these issues, we propose Stage-Diff, a staged generative
model for long-term time series based on diffusion models. First, through
stage-wise sequence generation and inter-stage information transfer, the model
preserves long-term sequence dependencies while enabling the modeling of data
distribution shifts. Second, within each stage, progressive sequence
decomposition is applied to perform channel-independent modeling at different
time scales, while inter-stage information transfer utilizes multi-channel
fusion modeling. This approach combines the robustness of channel-independent
modeling with the information fusion advantages of multi-channel modeling,
effectively balancing the intra-sequence and inter-sequence dependencies of
long-term time series. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets
validate the effectiveness of Stage-Diff in long-term time series generation
tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21330v1,,False
MyGO: Memory Yielding Generative Offline-consolidation for Lifelong Learning Systems,29/08/2025,"Shihao Ji, Zihui Song","Continual or Lifelong Learning aims to develop models capable of acquiring
new knowledge from a sequence of tasks without catastrophically forgetting what
has been learned before. Existing approaches often rely on storing samples from
previous tasks (experience replay) or employing complex regularization terms to
protect learned weights. However, these methods face challenges related to data
privacy, storage limitations, and performance degradation when tasks are
dissimilar. To address these challenges, we introduce MyGO (Memory Yielding
Generative Offline-consolidation), a novel lifelong learning framework inspired
by the biological wake-sleep cycle. During the ""wake"" phase, the system rapidly
learns a new task and trains a compact generative model (Generative Memory,
G-mem) to capture its data distribution. During the ""sleep"" phase, the system
enters an offline state, using all learned G-mem models to generate pseudo-data
(""dreams"") and consolidate new and old knowledge into a core feature extractor
via knowledge distillation. This approach obviates the need to store any raw
data, retaining only compact generative models, which offers significant
advantages in privacy and storage efficiency. We evaluate MyGO on computer
vision (Split-MNIST) and natural language processing (Split-AG News)
benchmarks, comparing it against a sequential fine-tuning baseline. The results
demonstrate that MyGO significantly mitigates catastrophic forgetting and
maintains high average accuracy across tasks, proving the framework's
effectiveness and domain-generality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21296v1,,False
A Financial Brain Scan of the LLM,29/08/2025,"Hui Chen, Antoine Didisheim, Luciano Somoza, Hanqing Tian","Emerging techniques in computer science make it possible to ""brain scan""
large language models (LLMs), identify the plain-English concepts that guide
their reasoning, and steer them while holding other factors constant. We show
that this approach can map LLM-generated economic forecasts to concepts such as
sentiment, technical analysis, and timing, and compute their relative
importance without reducing performance. We also show that models can be
steered to be more or less risk-averse, optimistic, or pessimistic, which
allows researchers to correct or simulate biases. The method is transparent,
lightweight, and replicable for empirical research in the social sciences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.21285v1,,False
