VITA: Vision-to-Action Flow Matching Policy,17/07/2025,"Dechen Gao, Boqi Zhao, Andrew Lee, Ian Chuang, Hanchu Zhou, Hang Wang, Zhe Zhao, Junshan Zhang, Iman Soltani","We present VITA, a Vision-To-Action flow matching policy that evolves latent
visual representations into latent actions for visuomotor control. Traditional
flow matching and diffusion policies sample from standard source distributions
(e.g., Gaussian noise) and require additional conditioning mechanisms like
cross-attention to condition action generation on visual information, creating
time and space overheads. VITA proposes a novel paradigm that treats latent
images as the flow source, learning an inherent mapping from vision to action
while eliminating separate conditioning modules and preserving generative
modeling capabilities. Learning flows between fundamentally different
modalities like vision and action is challenging due to sparse action data
lacking semantic structures and dimensional mismatches between high-dimensional
visual representations and raw actions. We address this by creating a
structured action latent space via an autoencoder as the flow matching target,
up-sampling raw actions to match visual representation shapes. Crucially, we
supervise flow matching with both encoder targets and final action outputs
through flow latent decoding, which backpropagates action reconstruction loss
through sequential flow matching ODE solving steps for effective end-to-end
learning. Implemented as simple MLP layers, VITA is evaluated on challenging
bi-manual manipulation tasks on the ALOHA platform, including 5 simulation and
2 real-world tasks. Despite its simplicity, MLP-only VITA outperforms or
matches state-of-the-art generative policies while reducing inference latency
by 50-130% compared to conventional flow matching policies requiring different
conditioning mechanisms or complex architectures. To our knowledge, VITA is the
first MLP-only flow matching policy capable of solving complex bi-manual
manipulation tasks like those in ALOHA benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13231v1,,False
MoTM: Towards a Foundation Model for Time Series Imputation based on Continuous Modeling,17/07/2025,"Etienne Le Naour, Tahar Nabil, Ghislain Agoua","Recent years have witnessed a growing interest for time series foundation
models, with a strong emphasis on the forecasting task. Yet, the crucial task
of out-of-domain imputation of missing values remains largely underexplored. We
propose a first step to fill this gap by leveraging implicit neural
representations (INRs). INRs model time series as continuous functions and
naturally handle various missing data scenarios and sampling rates. While they
have shown strong performance within specific distributions, they struggle
under distribution shifts. To address this, we introduce MoTM (Mixture of
Timeflow Models), a step toward a foundation model for time series imputation.
Building on the idea that a new time series is a mixture of previously seen
patterns, MoTM combines a basis of INRs, each trained independently on a
distinct family of time series, with a ridge regressor that adapts to the
observed context at inference. We demonstrate robust in-domain and
out-of-domain generalization across diverse imputation scenarios (e.g., block
and pointwise missingness, variable sampling rates), paving the way for
adaptable foundation imputation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13207v1,,False
GraspGen: A Diffusion-based Framework for 6-DOF Grasping with On-Generator Training,17/07/2025,"Adithyavairavan Murali, Balakumar Sundaralingam, Yu-Wei Chao, Wentao Yuan, Jun Yamada, Mark Carlson, Fabio Ramos, Stan Birchfield, Dieter Fox, Clemens Eppner","Grasping is a fundamental robot skill, yet despite significant research
advancements, learning-based 6-DOF grasping approaches are still not turnkey
and struggle to generalize across different embodiments and in-the-wild
settings. We build upon the recent success on modeling the object-centric grasp
generation process as an iterative diffusion process. Our proposed framework,
GraspGen, consists of a DiffusionTransformer architecture that enhances grasp
generation, paired with an efficient discriminator to score and filter sampled
grasps. We introduce a novel and performant on-generator training recipe for
the discriminator. To scale GraspGen to both objects and grippers, we release a
new simulated dataset consisting of over 53 million grasps. We demonstrate that
GraspGen outperforms prior methods in simulations with singulated objects
across different grippers, achieves state-of-the-art performance on the
FetchBench grasping benchmark, and performs well on a real robot with noisy
visual observations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13097v1,,False
The Power of Architecture: Deep Dive into Transformer Architectures for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting,17/07/2025,"Lefei Shen, Mouxiang Chen, Han Fu, Xiaoxue Ren, Xiaoyun Joy Wang, Jianling Sun, Zhuo Li, Chenghao Liu","Transformer-based models have recently become dominant in Long-term Time
Series Forecasting (LTSF), yet the variations in their architecture, such as
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, and decoder-only designs, raise a crucial
question: What Transformer architecture works best for LTSF tasks? However,
existing models are often tightly coupled with various time-series-specific
designs, making it difficult to isolate the impact of the architecture itself.
To address this, we propose a novel taxonomy that disentangles these designs,
enabling clearer and more unified comparisons of Transformer architectures. Our
taxonomy considers key aspects such as attention mechanisms, forecasting
aggregations, forecasting paradigms, and normalization layers. Through
extensive experiments, we uncover several key insights: bi-directional
attention with joint-attention is most effective; more complete forecasting
aggregation improves performance; and the direct-mapping paradigm outperforms
autoregressive approaches. Furthermore, our combined model, utilizing optimal
architectural choices, consistently outperforms several existing models,
reinforcing the validity of our conclusions. We hope these findings offer
valuable guidance for future research on Transformer architectural designs in
LTSF. Our code is available at https://github.com/HALF111/TSF_architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13043v1,,False
Fault detection and diagnosis for the engine electrical system of a space launcher based on a temporal convolutional autoencoder and calibrated classifiers,17/07/2025,"Luis Basora, Louison Bocquet-Nouaille, Elinirina Robinson, Serge Le Gonidec","In the context of the health monitoring for the next generation of reusable
space launchers, we outline a first step toward developing an onboard fault
detection and diagnostic capability for the electrical system that controls the
engine valves. Unlike existing approaches in the literature, our solution is
designed to meet a broader range of key requirements. This includes estimating
confidence levels for predictions, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) cases,
and controlling false alarms. The proposed solution is based on a temporal
convolutional autoencoder to automatically extract low-dimensional features
from raw sensor data. Fault detection and diagnosis are respectively carried
out using a binary and a multiclass classifier trained on the autoencoder
latent and residual spaces. The classifiers are histogram-based gradient
boosting models calibrated to output probabilities that can be interpreted as
confidence levels. A relatively simple technique, based on inductive conformal
anomaly detection, is used to identify OOD data. We leverage other simple yet
effective techniques, such as cumulative sum control chart (CUSUM) to limit the
false alarms, and threshold moving to address class imbalance in fault
detection. The proposed framework is highly configurable and has been evaluated
on simulated data, covering both nominal and anomalous operational scenarios.
The results indicate that our solution is a promising first step, though
testing with real data will be necessary to ensure that it achieves the
required maturity level for operational use.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.13022v1,,False
Trace Reconstruction with Language Models,17/07/2025,"Franziska Weindel, Michael Girsch, Reinhard Heckel","The general trace reconstruction problem seeks to recover an original
sequence from its noisy copies independently corrupted by deletions,
insertions, and substitutions. This problem arises in applications such as DNA
data storage, a promising storage medium due to its high information density
and longevity. However, errors introduced during DNA synthesis, storage, and
sequencing require correction through algorithms and codes, with trace
reconstruction often used as part of the data retrieval process. In this work,
we propose TReconLM, which leverages language models trained on next-token
prediction for trace reconstruction. We pretrain language models on synthetic
data and fine-tune on real-world data to adapt to technology-specific error
patterns. TReconLM outperforms state-of-the-art trace reconstruction
algorithms, including prior deep learning approaches, recovering a
substantially higher fraction of sequences without error.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12927v1,,False
Bayesian Modeling and Estimation of Linear Time-Variant Systems using Neural Networks and Gaussian Processes,17/07/2025,Yaniv Shulman,"The identification of Linear Time-Variant (LTV) systems from input-output
data is a fundamental yet challenging ill-posed inverse problem. This work
introduces a unified Bayesian framework that models the system's impulse
response, $h(t, \tau)$, as a stochastic process. We decompose the response into
a posterior mean and a random fluctuation term, a formulation that provides a
principled approach for quantifying uncertainty and naturally defines a new,
useful system class we term Linear Time-Invariant in Expectation (LTIE). To
perform inference, we leverage modern machine learning techniques, including
Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian Processes, using scalable variational
inference. We demonstrate through a series of experiments that our framework
can robustly infer the properties of an LTI system from a single noisy
observation, show superior data efficiency compared to classical methods in a
simulated ambient noise tomography problem, and successfully track a
continuously varying LTV impulse response by using a structured Gaussian
Process prior. This work provides a flexible and robust methodology for
uncertainty-aware system identification in dynamic environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12878v1,,False
Generative Multi-Target Cross-Domain Recommendation,17/07/2025,"Jinqiu Jin, Yang Zhang, Junwei Pan, Fuli Feng, Hua Lu, Haijie Gu, Xiangnan He","Recently, there has been a surge of interest in Multi-Target Cross-Domain
Recommendation (MTCDR), which aims to enhance recommendation performance across
multiple domains simultaneously. Existing MTCDR methods primarily rely on
domain-shared entities (\eg users or items) to fuse and transfer cross-domain
knowledge, which may be unavailable in non-overlapped recommendation scenarios.
Some studies model user preferences and item features as domain-sharable
semantic representations, which can be utilized to tackle the MTCDR task.
Nevertheless, they often require extensive auxiliary data for pre-training.
Developing more effective solutions for MTCDR remains an important area for
further exploration.
  Inspired by recent advancements in generative recommendation, this paper
introduces GMC, a generative paradigm-based approach for multi-target
cross-domain recommendation. The core idea of GMC is to leverage semantically
quantized discrete item identifiers as a medium for integrating multi-domain
knowledge within a unified generative model. GMC first employs an item
tokenizer to generate domain-shared semantic identifiers for each item, and
then formulates item recommendation as a next-token generation task by training
a domain-unified sequence-to-sequence model. To further leverage the domain
information to enhance performance, we incorporate a domain-aware contrastive
loss into the semantic identifier learning, and perform domain-specific
fine-tuning on the unified recommender. Extensive experiments on five public
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of GMC compared to a range of baseline
methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12871v1,,False
Information-Theoretic Aggregation of Ethical Attributes in Simulated-Command,17/07/2025,"Hussein Abbass, Taylan Akay, Harrison Tolley","In the age of AI, human commanders need to use the computational powers
available in today's environment to simulate a very large number of scenarios.
Within each scenario, situations occur where different decision design options
could have ethical consequences. Making these decisions reliant on human
judgement is both counter-productive to the aim of exploring very large number
of scenarios in a timely manner and infeasible when considering the workload
needed to involve humans in each of these choices. In this paper, we move human
judgement outside the simulation decision cycle. Basically, the human will
design the ethical metric space, leaving it to the simulated environment to
explore the space. When the simulation completes its testing cycles, the
testing environment will come back to the human commander with a few options to
select from. The human commander will then exercise human-judgement to select
the most appropriate course of action, which will then get executed
accordingly. We assume that the problem of designing metrics that are
sufficiently granular to assess the ethical implications of decisions is
solved. Subsequently, the fundamental problem we look at in this paper is how
to weight ethical decisions during the running of these simulations; that is,
how to dynamically weight the ethical attributes when agents are faced with
decision options with ethical implications during generative simulations. The
multi-criteria decision making literature has started to look at nearby
problems, where the concept of entropy has been used to determine the weights
during aggregation. We draw from that literature different approaches to
automatically calculate the weights for ethical attributes during
simulation-based testing and evaluation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.12862v1,,False
