OmniX: From Unified Panoramic Generation and Perception to Graphics-Ready 3D Scenes,30/10/2025,"Yukun Huang, Jiwen Yu, Yanning Zhou, Jianan Wang, Xintao Wang, Pengfei Wan, Xihui Liu","There are two prevalent ways to constructing 3D scenes: procedural generation
and 2D lifting. Among them, panorama-based 2D lifting has emerged as a
promising technique, leveraging powerful 2D generative priors to produce
immersive, realistic, and diverse 3D environments. In this work, we advance
this technique to generate graphics-ready 3D scenes suitable for physically
based rendering (PBR), relighting, and simulation. Our key insight is to
repurpose 2D generative models for panoramic perception of geometry, textures,
and PBR materials. Unlike existing 2D lifting approaches that emphasize
appearance generation and ignore the perception of intrinsic properties, we
present OmniX, a versatile and unified framework. Based on a lightweight and
efficient cross-modal adapter structure, OmniX reuses 2D generative priors for
a broad range of panoramic vision tasks, including panoramic perception,
generation, and completion. Furthermore, we construct a large-scale synthetic
panorama dataset containing high-quality multimodal panoramas from diverse
indoor and outdoor scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our model in panoramic visual perception and graphics-ready 3D scene
generation, opening new possibilities for immersive and physically realistic
virtual world generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26800v1,,False
"Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability",30/10/2025,"Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli","We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by
Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random
number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty
over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise
shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that
Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on
unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published
classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up
to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens.
Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can
be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented
together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying
structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with
modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for
near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization
enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq
2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating
a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding
layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the model spontaneously
groups the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters,
revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26792v1,,False
Clone Deterministic 3D Worlds with Geometrically-Regularized World Models,30/10/2025,"Zaishuo Xia, Yukuan Lu, Xinyi Li, Yifan Xu, Yubei Chen","A world model is an internal model that simulates how the world evolves.
Given past observations and actions, it predicts the future of both the
embodied agent and its environment. Accurate world models are essential for
enabling agents to think, plan, and reason effectively in complex, dynamic
settings. Despite rapid progress, current world models remain brittle and
degrade over long horizons. We argue that a central cause is representation
quality: exteroceptive inputs (e.g., images) are high-dimensional, and lossy or
entangled latents make dynamics learning unnecessarily hard. We therefore ask
whether improving representation learning alone can substantially improve
world-model performance. In this work, we take a step toward building a truly
accurate world model by addressing a fundamental yet open problem: constructing
a model that can fully clone and overfit to a deterministic 3D world. We
propose Geometrically-Regularized World Models (GRWM), which enforces that
consecutive points along a natural sensory trajectory remain close in latent
representation space. This approach yields significantly improved latent
representations that align closely with the true topology of the environment.
GRWM is plug-and-play, requires only minimal architectural modification, scales
with trajectory length, and is compatible with diverse latent generative
backbones. Across deterministic 3D settings and long-horizon prediction tasks,
GRWM significantly increases rollout fidelity and stability. Analyses show that
its benefits stem from learning a latent manifold with superior geometric
structure. These findings support a clear takeaway: improving representation
learning is a direct and useful path to robust world models, delivering
reliable long-horizon predictions without enlarging the dynamics module.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26782v1,,False
Pre-trained Forecasting Models: Strong Zero-Shot Feature Extractors for Time Series Classification,30/10/2025,"Andreas Auer, Daniel Klotz, Sebastinan BÃ¶ck, Sepp Hochreiter","Recent research on time series foundation models has primarily focused on
forecasting, leaving it unclear how generalizable their learned representations
are. In this study, we examine whether frozen pre-trained forecasting models
can provide effective representations for classification. To this end, we
compare different representation extraction strategies and introduce two
model-agnostic embedding augmentations. Our experiments show that the best
forecasting models achieve classification accuracy that matches or even
surpasses that of state-of-the-art models pre-trained specifically for
classification. Moreover, we observe a positive correlation between forecasting
and classification performance. These findings challenge the assumption that
task-specific pre-training is necessary, and suggest that learning to forecast
may provide a powerful route toward constructing general-purpose time series
foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26777v1,,False
STaMP: Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision for Low-Precision Activation Quantization,30/10/2025,"Marco Federici, Riccardo Del Chiaro, Boris van Breugel, Paul Whatmough, Markus Nagel","Quantization is the key method for reducing inference latency, power and
memory footprint of generative AI models. However, accuracy often degrades
sharply when activations are quantized below eight bits. Recent work suggests
that invertible linear transformations (e.g. rotations) can aid quantization,
by reparameterizing feature channels and weights. In this paper, we propose
\textit{Sequence Transformation and Mixed Precision} (STaMP) quantization, a
novel strategy that applies linear transformations along the \textit{sequence}
dimension to exploit the strong local correlation in language and visual data.
By keeping a small number of tokens in each intermediate activation at higher
precision, we can maintain model accuracy at lower (average) activations
bit-widths. We evaluate STaMP on recent LVM and LLM architectures,
demonstrating that it significantly improves low bit width activation
quantization and complements established activation and weight quantization
methods including recent feature transformations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26771v1,,False
Deep sequence models tend to memorize geometrically; it is unclear why,30/10/2025,"Shahriar Noroozizadeh, Vaishnavh Nagarajan, Elan Rosenfeld, Sanjiv Kumar","In sequence modeling, the parametric memory of atomic facts has been
predominantly abstracted as a brute-force lookup of co-occurrences between
entities. We contrast this associative view against a geometric view of how
memory is stored. We begin by isolating a clean and analyzable instance of
Transformer reasoning that is incompatible with memory as strictly a storage of
the local co-occurrences specified during training. Instead, the model must
have somehow synthesized its own geometry of atomic facts, encoding global
relationships between all entities, including non-co-occurring ones. This in
turn has simplified a hard reasoning task involving an $\ell$-fold composition
into an easy-to-learn 1-step geometric task.
  From this phenomenon, we extract fundamental aspects of neural embedding
geometries that are hard to explain. We argue that the rise of such a geometry,
despite optimizing over mere local associations, cannot be straightforwardly
attributed to typical architectural or optimizational pressures.
Counterintuitively, an elegant geometry is learned even when it is not more
succinct than a brute-force lookup of associations.
  Then, by analyzing a connection to Node2Vec, we demonstrate how the geometry
stems from a spectral bias that -- in contrast to prevailing theories -- indeed
arises naturally despite the lack of various pressures. This analysis also
points to practitioners a visible headroom to make Transformer memory more
strongly geometric. We hope the geometric view of parametric memory encourages
revisiting the default intuitions that guide researchers in areas like
knowledge acquisition, capacity, discovery and unlearning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26745v1,,False
Assessment of the conditional exchangeability assumption in causal machine learning models: a simulation study,30/10/2025,"Gerard T. Portela, Jason B. Gibbons, Sebastian Schneeweiss, Rishi J. Desai","Observational studies developing causal machine learning (ML) models for the
prediction of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) seldom conduct empirical
evaluations to assess the conditional exchangeability assumption. We aimed to
evaluate the performance of these models under conditional exchangeability
violations and the utility of negative control outcomes (NCOs) as a diagnostic.
We conducted a simulation study to examine confounding bias in ITE estimates
generated by causal forest and X-learner models under varying conditions,
including the presence or absence of true heterogeneity. We simulated data to
reflect real-world scenarios with differing levels of confounding, sample size,
and NCO confounding structures. We then estimated and compared subgroup-level
treatment effects on the primary outcome and NCOs across settings with and
without unmeasured confounding. When conditional exchangeability was violated,
causal forest and X-learner models failed to recover true treatment effect
heterogeneity and, in some cases, falsely indicated heterogeneity when there
was none. NCOs successfully identified subgroups affected by unmeasured
confounding. Even when NCOs did not perfectly satisfy its ideal assumptions, it
remained informative, flagging potential bias in subgroup level estimates,
though not always pinpointing the subgroup with the largest confounding.
Violations of conditional exchangeability substantially limit the validity of
ITE estimates from causal ML models in routinely collected observational data.
NCOs serve a useful empirical diagnostic tool for detecting subgroup-specific
unmeasured confounding and should be incorporated into causal ML workflows to
support the credibility of individualized inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26700v1,,False

the first time, outperforms full attention under fair comparisons across
various scenarios -- including short-context, long-context, and reinforcement
learning (RL) scaling regimes. At its core lies Kimi Delta Attention (KDA), an
expressive linear attention module that extends Gated DeltaNet with a
finer-grained gating mechanism, enabling more effective use of limited
finite-state RNN memory. Our bespoke chunkwise algorithm achieves high hardware
efficiency through a specialized variant of the Diagonal-Plus-Low-Rank (DPLR)
transition matrices, which substantially reduces computation compared to the
general DPLR formulation while remaining more consistent with the classical
delta rule.
  We pretrain a Kimi Linear model with 3B activated parameters and 48B total
parameters, based on a layerwise hybrid of KDA and Multi-Head Latent Attention
(MLA). Our experiments show that with an identical training recipe, Kimi Linear
outperforms full MLA with a sizeable margin across all evaluated tasks, while
reducing KV cache usage by up to 75% and achieving up to 6 times decoding
throughput for a 1M context. These results demonstrate that Kimi Linear can be
a drop-in replacement for full attention architectures with superior
performance and efficiency, including tasks with longer input and output
lengths.
  To support further research, we open-source the KDA kernel and vLLM
implementations, and release the pre-trained and instruction-tuned model
checkpoints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26692v1,,False
FlowQ-Net: A Generative Framework for Automated Quantum Circuit Design,30/10/2025,"Jun Dai, Michael Rizvi-Martel, Guillaume Rabusseau","Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the
potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale
quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are
paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and
handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce
\textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework
for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks
(GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits
sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward
function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth,
and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse
ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization.
We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of
simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz
design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image
classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits
designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding
circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters,
gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without
compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles
from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of
generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum
circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum
algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26688v1,,False
MSAD: A Deep Dive into Model Selection for Time series Anomaly Detection,30/10/2025,"Emmanouil Sylligardos, John Paparrizos, Themis Palpanas, Pierre Senellart, Paul Boniol","Anomaly detection is a fundamental task for time series analytics with
important implications for the downstream performance of many applications.
Despite increasing academic interest and the large number of methods proposed
in the literature, recent benchmarks and evaluation studies demonstrated that
no overall best anomaly detection methods exist when applied to very
heterogeneous time series datasets. Therefore, the only scalable and viable
solution to solve anomaly detection over very different time series collected
from diverse domains is to propose a model selection method that will select,
based on time series characteristics, the best anomaly detection methods to
run. Existing AutoML solutions are, unfortunately, not directly applicable to
time series anomaly detection, and no evaluation of time series-based
approaches for model selection exists. Towards that direction, this paper
studies the performance of time series classification methods used as model
selection for anomaly detection. In total, we evaluate 234 model configurations
derived from 16 base classifiers across more than 1980 time series, and we
propose the first extensive experimental evaluation of time series
classification as model selection for anomaly detection. Our results
demonstrate that model selection methods outperform every single anomaly
detection method while being in the same order of magnitude regarding execution
time. This evaluation is the first step to demonstrate the accuracy and
efficiency of time series classification algorithms for anomaly detection, and
represents a strong baseline that can then be used to guide the model selection
step in general AutoML pipelines. Preprint version of an article accepted at

Quantum Gated Recurrent GAN with Gaussian Uncertainty for Network Anomaly Detection,30/10/2025,"Wajdi Hammami, Soumaya Cherkaoui, Jean-Frederic Laprade, Ola Ahmad, Shengrui Wang","Anomaly detection in time-series data is a critical challenge with
significant implications for network security. Recent quantum machine learning
approaches, such as quantum kernel methods and variational quantum circuits,
have shown promise in capturing complex data distributions for anomaly
detection but remain constrained by limited qubit counts. We introduce in this
work a novel Quantum Gated Recurrent Unit (QGRU)-based Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) employing Successive Data Injection (SuDaI) and a multi-metric
gating strategy for robust network anomaly detection. Our model uniquely
utilizes a quantum-enhanced generator that outputs parameters (mean and
log-variance) of a Gaussian distribution via reparameterization, combined with
a Wasserstein critic to stabilize adversarial training. Anomalies are
identified through a novel gating mechanism that initially flags potential
anomalies based on Gaussian uncertainty estimates and subsequently verifies
them using a composite of critic scores and reconstruction errors. Evaluated on
benchmark datasets, our method achieves a high time-series aware F1 score
(TaF1) of 89.43% demonstrating superior capability in detecting anomalies
accurately and promptly as compared to existing classical and quantum models.
Furthermore, the trained QGRU-WGAN was deployed on real IBM Quantum hardware,
where it retained high anomaly detection performance, confirming its robustness
and practical feasibility on current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)
devices.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26487v1,,False
An Impulse Control Approach to Market Making in a Hawkes LOB Market,30/10/2025,"Konark Jain, Nick Firoozye, Jonathan Kochems, Philip Treleaven","We study the optimal Market Making problem in a Limit Order Book (LOB) market
simulated using a high-fidelity, mutually exciting Hawkes process. Departing
from traditional Brownian-driven mid-price models, our setup captures key
microstructural properties such as queue dynamics, inter-arrival clustering,
and endogenous price impact. Recognizing the realistic constraint that market
makers cannot update strategies at every LOB event, we formulate the control
problem within an impulse control framework, where interventions occur
discretely via limit, cancel, or market orders. This leads to a
high-dimensional, non-local Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Quasi-Variational
Inequality (HJB-QVI), whose solution is analytically intractable and
computationally expensive due to the curse of dimensionality. To address this,
we propose a novel Reinforcement Learning (RL) approximation inspired by
auxiliary control formulations. Using a two-network PPO-based architecture with
self-imitation learning, we demonstrate strong empirical performance with
limited training, achieving Sharpe ratios above 30 in a realistic simulated
LOB. In addition to that, we solve the HJB-QVI using a deep learning method
inspired by Sirignano and Spiliopoulos 2018 and compare the performance with
the RL agent. Our findings highlight the promise of combining impulse control
theory with modern deep RL to tackle optimal execution problems in jump-driven
microstructural markets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26438v1,,False
Co-Evolving Latent Action World Models,30/10/2025,"Yucen Wang, Fengming Zhang, De-Chuan Zhan, Li Zhao, Kaixin Wang, Jiang Bian","Adapting pre-trained video generation models into controllable world models
via latent actions is a promising step towards creating generalist world
models. The dominant paradigm adopts a two-stage approach that trains latent
action model (LAM) and the world model separately, resulting in redundant
training and limiting their potential for co-adaptation. A conceptually simple
and appealing idea is to directly replace the forward dynamic model in LAM with
a powerful world model and training them jointly, but it is non-trivial and
prone to representational collapse. In this work, we propose CoLA-World, which
for the first time successfully realizes this synergistic paradigm, resolving
the core challenge in joint learning through a critical warm-up phase that
effectively aligns the representations of the from-scratch LAM with the
pre-trained world model. This unlocks a co-evolution cycle: the world model
acts as a knowledgeable tutor, providing gradients to shape a high-quality LAM,
while the LAM offers a more precise and adaptable control interface to the
world model. Empirically, CoLA-World matches or outperforms prior two-stage
methods in both video simulation quality and downstream visual planning,
establishing a robust and efficient new paradigm for the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26433v1,,False
Model Inversion with Layer-Specific Modeling and Alignment for Data-Free Continual Learning,30/10/2025,"Ruilin Tong, Haodong Lu, Yuhang Liu, Dong Gong","Continual learning (CL) aims to incrementally train a model on a sequence of
tasks while retaining performance on prior ones. However, storing and replaying
data is often infeasible due to privacy or security constraints and impractical
for arbitrary pre-trained models. Data-free CL seeks to update models without
access to previous data. Beyond regularization, we employ model inversion to
synthesize data from the trained model, enabling replay without storing
samples. Yet, model inversion in predictive models faces two challenges: (1)
generating inputs solely from compressed output labels causes drift between
synthetic and real data, and replaying such data can erode prior knowledge; (2)
inversion is computationally expensive since each step backpropagates through
the full model. These issues are amplified in large pre-trained models such as
CLIP. To improve efficiency, we propose Per-layer Model Inversion (PMI),
inspired by faster convergence in single-layer optimization. PMI provides
strong initialization for full-model inversion, substantially reducing
iterations. To mitigate feature shift, we model class-wise features via
Gaussian distributions and contrastive model, ensuring alignment between
synthetic and real features. Combining PMI and feature modeling, our approach
enables continual learning of new classes by generating pseudo-images from
semantic-aware projected features, achieving strong effectiveness and
compatibility across multiple CL settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26311v1,,False
Learning to Manage Investment Portfolios beyond Simple Utility Functions,30/10/2025,"Maarten P. Scholl, Mahmoud Mahfouz, Anisoara Calinescu, J. Doyne Farmer","While investment funds publicly disclose their objectives in broad terms,
their managers optimize for complex combinations of competing goals that go
beyond simple risk-return trade-offs. Traditional approaches attempt to model
this through multi-objective utility functions, but face fundamental challenges
in specification and parameterization. We propose a generative framework that
learns latent representations of fund manager strategies without requiring
explicit utility specification.
  Our approach directly models the conditional probability of a fund's
portfolio weights, given stock characteristics, historical returns, previous
weights, and a latent variable representing the fund's strategy. Unlike methods
based on reinforcement learning or imitation learning, which require specified
rewards or labeled expert objectives, our GAN-based architecture learns
directly from the joint distribution of observed holdings and market data.
  We validate our framework on a dataset of 1436 U.S. equity mutual funds. The
learned representations successfully capture known investment styles, such as
""growth"" and ""value,"" while also revealing implicit manager objectives. For
instance, we find that while many funds exhibit characteristics of
Markowitz-like optimization, they do so with heterogeneous realizations for
turnover, concentration, and latent factors.
  To analyze and interpret the end-to-end model, we develop a series of tests
that explain the model, and we show that the benchmark's expert labeling are
contained in our model's encoding in a linear interpretable way.
  Our framework provides a data-driven approach for characterizing investment
strategies for applications in market simulation, strategy attribution, and
regulatory oversight.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26165v1,10.1145/3768292.3770426,False
New Money: A Systematic Review of Synthetic Data Generation for Finance,30/10/2025,"James Meldrum, Basem Suleiman, Fethi Rabhi, Muhammad Johan Alibasa","Synthetic data generation has emerged as a promising approach to address the
challenges of using sensitive financial data in machine learning applications.
By leveraging generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), it is possible to create artificial
datasets that preserve the statistical properties of real financial records
while mitigating privacy risks and regulatory constraints. Despite the rapid
growth of this field, a comprehensive synthesis of the current research
landscape has been lacking. This systematic review consolidates and analyses 72
studies published since 2018 that focus on synthetic financial data generation.
We categorise the types of financial information synthesised, the generative
methods employed, and the evaluation strategies used to assess data utility and
privacy. The findings indicate that GAN-based approaches dominate the
literature, particularly for generating time-series market data and tabular
credit data. While several innovative techniques demonstrate potential for
improved realism and privacy preservation, there remains a notable lack of
rigorous evaluation of privacy safeguards across studies. By providing an
integrated overview of generative techniques, applications, and evaluation

Bias-Corrected Data Synthesis for Imbalanced Learning,30/10/2025,"Pengfei Lyu, Zhengchi Ma, Linjun Zhang, Anru R. Zhang","Imbalanced data, where the positive samples represent only a small proportion
compared to the negative samples, makes it challenging for classification
problems to balance the false positive and false negative rates. A common
approach to addressing the challenge involves generating synthetic data for the
minority group and then training classification models with both observed and
synthetic data. However, since the synthetic data depends on the observed data
and fails to replicate the original data distribution accurately, prediction
accuracy is reduced when the synthetic data is naively treated as the true
data. In this paper, we address the bias introduced by synthetic data and
provide consistent estimators for this bias by borrowing information from the
majority group. We propose a bias correction procedure to mitigate the adverse
effects of synthetic data, enhancing prediction accuracy while avoiding
overfitting. This procedure is extended to broader scenarios with imbalanced
data, such as imbalanced multi-task learning and causal inference. Theoretical
properties, including bounds on bias estimation errors and improvements in
prediction accuracy, are provided. Simulation results and data analysis on
handwritten digit datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26046v1,,False
