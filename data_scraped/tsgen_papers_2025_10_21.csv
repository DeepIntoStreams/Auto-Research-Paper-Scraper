Enterprise Deep Research: Steerable Multi-Agent Deep Research for Enterprise Analytics,20/10/2025,"Akshara Prabhakar, Roshan Ram, Zixiang Chen, Silvio Savarese, Frank Wang, Caiming Xiong, Huan Wang, Weiran Yao","As information grows exponentially, enterprises face increasing pressure to
transform unstructured data into coherent, actionable insights. While
autonomous agents show promise, they often struggle with domain-specific
nuances, intent alignment, and enterprise integration. We present Enterprise
Deep Research (EDR), a multi-agent system that integrates (1) a Master Planning
Agent for adaptive query decomposition, (2) four specialized search agents
(General, Academic, GitHub, LinkedIn), (3) an extensible MCP-based tool
ecosystem supporting NL2SQL, file analysis, and enterprise workflows, (4) a
Visualization Agent for data-driven insights, and (5) a reflection mechanism
that detects knowledge gaps and updates research direction with optional
human-in-the-loop steering guidance. These components enable automated report
generation, real-time streaming, and seamless enterprise deployment, as
validated on internal datasets. On open-ended benchmarks including DeepResearch
Bench and DeepConsult, EDR outperforms state-of-the-art agentic systems without
any human steering. We release the EDR framework and benchmark trajectories to
advance research on multi-agent reasoning applications.

SoftMimic: Learning Compliant Whole-body Control from Examples,20/10/2025,"Gabriel B. Margolis, Michelle Wang, Nolan Fey, Pulkit Agrawal","We introduce SoftMimic, a framework for learning compliant whole-body control
policies for humanoid robots from example motions. Imitating human motions with
reinforcement learning allows humanoids to quickly learn new skills, but
existing methods incentivize stiff control that aggressively corrects
deviations from a reference motion, leading to brittle and unsafe behavior when
the robot encounters unexpected contacts. In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots
to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and
posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an
augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a
reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant
responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns
to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion
clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments,
demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17792v1,,False
Efficient Tensor Completion Algorithms for Highly Oscillatory Operators,20/10/2025,"Navjot Singh, Edgar Solomonik, Xiaoye Sherry Li, Yang Liu","This paper presents low-complexity tensor completion algorithms and their
efficient implementation to reconstruct highly oscillatory operators
discretized as $n\times n$ matrices. The underlying tensor decomposition is
based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into
an order $\mathcal{O} (\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into
a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor
decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the
existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We
propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using
alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel
strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an
initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and
applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical
experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In
these experiments, we use $\mathcal {O} (n \log n)$ observed entries in the
input matrix and demonstrate an $\mathcal{O}(n\log^3 n)$ computational cost of
the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per
iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized
tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion
algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve
reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling
accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art
completion algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17734v1,,False
Quantum Synthetic Data Generation for Industrial Bioprocess Monitoring,20/10/2025,"Shawn M. Gibford, Mohammad Reza Boskabadi, Christopher J. Savoie, Seyed Soheil Mansouri","Data scarcity and sparsity in bio-manufacturing poses challenges for accurate
model
  development, process monitoring, and optimization. We aim to replicate and
capture
  the complex dynamics of industrial bioprocesses by proposing the use of a
Quantum
  Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (QWGAN-GP)

  generate synthetic time series data for industrially relevant processes. The
  generator within our GAN is comprised of a Parameterized Quantum Circuit

ZACH-ViT: A Zero-Token Vision Transformer with ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation for Robust Lung Ultrasound Classification,20/10/2025,"Athanasios Angelakis, Amne Mousa, Micah L. A. Heldeweg, Laurens A. Biesheuvel, Mark A. Haaksma, Jasper M. Smit, Pieter R. Tuinman, Paul W. G. Elbers","Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17650v1,,False
Intent-Driven LLM Ensemble Planning for Flexible Multi-Robot Disassembly: Demonstration on EV Batteries,20/10/2025,"Cansu Erdogan, Cesar Alan Contreras, Alireza Rastegarpanah, Manolis Chiou, Rustam Stolkin","This paper addresses the problem of planning complex manipulation tasks, in
which multiple robots with different end-effectors and capabilities, informed
by computer vision, must plan and execute concatenated sequences of actions on
a variety of objects that can appear in arbitrary positions and configurations
in unstructured scenes. We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can
robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory
input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates:
(i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language
models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's
intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence
constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects
hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two
robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for
recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in
specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order
feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with
600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of
full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare
five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components).
We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution
and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our
ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe,
executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17576v1,,False
Semi-supervised Latent Bayesian Optimization for Designing Antimicrobial Peptides,20/10/2025,"Jyler Menard, R. A. Mansbach","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17569v1,,False
Plasma Shape Control via Zero-shot Generative Reinforcement Learning,20/10/2025,"Niannian Wu, Rongpeng Li, Zongyu Yang, Yong Xiao, Ning Wei, Yihang Chen, Bo Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Wulyu Zhong","Traditional PID controllers have limited adaptability for plasma shape
control, and task-specific reinforcement learning (RL) methods suffer from
limited generalization and the need for repetitive retraining. To overcome
these challenges, this paper proposes a novel framework for developing a
versatile, zero-shot control policy from a large-scale offline dataset of
historical PID-controlled discharges. Our approach synergistically combines
Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning (GAIL) with Hilbert space
representation learning to achieve dual objectives: mimicking the stable
operational style of the PID data and constructing a geometrically structured
latent space for efficient, goal-directed control. The resulting foundation
policy can be deployed for diverse trajectory tracking tasks in a zero-shot
manner without any task-specific fine-tuning. Evaluations on the HL-3 tokamak
simulator demonstrate that the policy excels at precisely and stably tracking
reference trajectories for key shape parameters across a range of plasma
scenarios. This work presents a viable pathway toward developing highly

MUG-V 10B: High-efficiency Training Pipeline for Large Video Generation Models,20/10/2025,"Yongshun Zhang, Zhongyi Fan, Yonghang Zhang, Zhangzikang Li, Weifeng Chen, Zhongwei Feng, Chaoyue Wang, Peng Hou, Anxiang Zeng","In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public

SAFE-D: A Spatiotemporal Detection Framework for Abnormal Driving Among Parkinson's Disease-like Drivers,20/10/2025,"Hangcheng Cao, Baixiang Huang, Longzhi Yuan, Haonan An, Zihan Fang, Xianhao Chen, Yuguang Fang","A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17517v1,,False
Layer Specialization Underlying Compositional Reasoning in Transformers,20/10/2025,Jing Liu,"Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17469v1,,False
Active Inference for an Intelligent Agent in Autonomous Reconnaissance Missions,20/10/2025,"Johan Schubert, Farzad Kamrani, Tove Gustavi","We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and ""negative"" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17450v1,,False
From Spatial to Actions: Grounding Vision-Language-Action Model in Spatial Foundation Priors,20/10/2025,"Zhengshen Zhang, Hao Li, Yalun Dai, Zhengbang Zhu, Lei Zhou, Chenchen Liu, Dong Wang, Francis E. H. Tay, Sijin Chen, Ziwei Liu, Yuxiao Liu, Xinghang Li, Pan Zhou","Existing vision-language-action (VLA) models act in 3D real-world but are
typically built on 2D encoders, leaving a spatial reasoning gap that limits
generalization and adaptability. Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs
either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or
inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In
this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that
injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial
foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and
includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for
higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To
preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced
Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone.
These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation,
modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across
three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON

Diverse Planning with Simulators via Linear Temporal Logic,20/10/2025,"Mustafa F. Abdelwahed, Alice Toniolo, Joan Espasa, Ian P. Gent","Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17418v1,,False
BenCao: An Instruction-Tuned Large Language Model for Traditional Chinese Medicine,20/10/2025,"Jiacheng Xie, Yang Yu, Yibo Chen, Hanyao Zhang, Lening Zhao, Jiaxuan He, Lei Jiang, Xiaoting Tang, Guanghui An, Dong Xu","Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two
millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language
models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic
reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain
LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal
integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these
limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM,
integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback
refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning
rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and
ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive
knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based
instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation
mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process
involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for
tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic
access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question
benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior
accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics,
herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an
interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000
users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of
developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning

real-world deployment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17415v1,,False
A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Prediction of Battery Capacity Degradation,20/10/2025,"Hequn Li, Zhongwei Deng, Chunlin Jiang, Yvxin He andZhansheng Ning","Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results

RINS-T: Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems,20/10/2025,"Keivan Faghih Niresi, Zepeng Zhang, Olga Fink","Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent

Fair and Interpretable Deepfake Detection in Videos,20/10/2025,"Akihito Yoshii, Ryosuke Sonoda, Ramya Srinivasan","Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal

and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on

deviations from intended mission semantics. To tackle this, we introduce a
structured data generation framework based on the Nets-within-Nets (NWN)

identifying execution inefficiencies, and demonstrates robust detection
capabilities for core mission violations (88.3%) and constraint-based adaptive

Understanding and Improving Length Generalization in Hierarchical Sparse Attention Models,20/10/2025,"Jiaqi Leng, Xiang Hu, Junxiong Wang, Jianguo Li, Wei Wu, Yucheng Lu","Effectively processing long contexts is a critical challenge for language
models. While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and
poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window
attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize
the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention
has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the
key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully
understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to
identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified
framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination
of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk
Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval;
(2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information
without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced
selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution
gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing
and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new
state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully
generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and

Offline Policy Evaluation of Multi-Turn LLM Health Coaching with Real Users,20/10/2025,"Melik Ozolcer, Sang Won Bae","We study a web-deployed, tool-augmented LLM health coach with real users. In

Discovering Causal Relationships using Proxy Variables under Unmeasured Confounding,20/10/2025,"Yong Wu, Yanwei Fu, Shouyan Wang, Yizhou Wang, Xinwei Sun","Inferring causal relationships between variable pairs in the observational
study is crucial but challenging, due to the presence of unmeasured
confounding. While previous methods employed the negative controls to adjust
for the confounding bias, they were either restricted to the discrete setting
(i.e., all variables are discrete) or relied on strong assumptions for
identification. To address these problems, we develop a general nonparametric
approach that accommodates both discrete and continuous settings for testing
causal hypothesis under unmeasured confounders. By using only a single negative
control outcome (NCO), we establish a new identification result based on a
newly proposed integral equation that links the outcome and NCO, requiring only
the completeness and mild regularity conditions. We then propose a kernel-based
testing procedure that is more efficient than existing moment-restriction
methods. We derive the asymptotic level and power properties for our tests.
Furthermore, we examine cases where our procedure using only NCO fails to
achieve identification, and introduce a new procedure that incorporates a
negative control exposure (NCE) to restore identifiability. We demonstrate the

ALPINE: A Lightweight and Adaptive Privacy-Decision Agent Framework for Dynamic Edge Crowdsensing,20/10/2025,"Guanjie Cheng, Siyang Liu, Junqin Huang, Xinkui Zhao, Yin Wang, Mengying Zhu, Linghe Kong, Shuiguang Deng","Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17162v1,,False
GACO-CAD: Geometry-Augmented and Conciseness-Optimized CAD Model Generation from Single Image,20/10/2025,"Yinghui Wang, Xinyu Zhang, Peng Du","Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17157v1,,False
Matricial Free Energy as a Gaussianizing Regularizer: Enhancing Autoencoders for Gaussian Code Generation,20/10/2025,"Rishi Sonthalia, Raj Rao Nadakuditi","We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17120v1,,False
A Brain Cell Type Resource Created by Large Language Models and a Multi-Agent AI System for Collaborative Community Annotation,20/10/2025,"Rongbin Li, Wenbo Chen, Zhao Li, Rodrigo Munoz-Castaneda, Jinbo Li, Neha S. Maurya, Arnav Solanki, Huan He, Hanwen Xing, Meaghan Ramlakhan, Zachary Wise, Zhuhao Wu, Hua Xu, Michael Hawrylycz, W. Jim Zheng","Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.17064v1,,False
