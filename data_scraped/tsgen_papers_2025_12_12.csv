Stronger Normalization-Free Transformers,11/12/2025,"Mingzhi Chen, Taiming Lu, Jiachen Zhu, Mingjie Sun, Zhuang Liu","Although normalization layers have long been viewed as indispensable components of deep learning architectures, the recent introduction of Dynamic Tanh (DyT) has demonstrated that alternatives are possible. The point-wise function DyT constrains extreme values for stable convergence and reaches normalization-level performance; this work seeks further for function designs that can surpass it. We first study how the intrinsic properties of point-wise functions influence training and performance. Building on these findings, we conduct a large-scale search for a more effective function design. Through this exploration, we introduce $\mathrm{Derf}(x) = \mathrm{erf}(αx + s)$, where $\mathrm{erf}(x)$ is the rescaled Gaussian cumulative distribution function, and identify it as the most performant design. Derf outperforms LayerNorm, RMSNorm, and DyT across a wide range of domains, including vision (image recognition and generation), speech representation, and DNA sequence modeling. Our findings suggest that the performance gains of Derf largely stem from its improved generalization rather than stronger fitting capacity. Its simplicity and stronger performance make Derf a practical choice for normalization-free Transformer architectures.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10938v1,,False
A Differentiable Digital Twin of Distributed Link Scheduling for Contention-Aware Networking,11/12/2025,"Zhongyuan Zhao, Yujun Ming, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra","Many routing and flow optimization problems in wired networks can be solved efficiently using minimum cost flow formulations. However, this approach does not extend to wireless multi-hop networks, where the assumptions of fixed link capacity and linear cost structure collapse due to contention for shared spectrum resources. The key challenge is that the long-term capacity of a wireless link becomes a non-linear function of its network context, including network topology, link quality, and the traffic assigned to neighboring links. In this work, we pursue a new direction of modeling wireless network under randomized medium access control by developing an analytical network digital twin (NDT) that predicts link duty cycles from network context. We generalize randomized contention as finding a Maximal Independent Set (MIS) on the conflict graph using weighted Luby's algorithm, derive an analytical model of link duty cycles, and introduce an iterative procedure that resolves the circular dependency among duty cycle, link capacity, and contention probability. Our numerical experiments show that the proposed NDT accurately predicts link duty cycles and congestion patterns with up to a 5000x speedup over packet-level simulation, and enables us to optimize link scheduling using gradient descent for reduced congestion and radio footprint.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10874v1,,False
HAROOD: A Benchmark for Out-of-distribution Generalization in Sensor-based Human Activity Recognition,11/12/2025,"Wang Lu, Yao Zhu, Jindong Wang","Sensor-based human activity recognition (HAR) mines activity patterns from the time-series sensory data. In realistic scenarios, variations across individuals, devices, environments, and time introduce significant distributional shifts for the same activities. Recent efforts attempt to solve this challenge by applying or adapting existing out-of-distribution (OOD) algorithms, but only in certain distribution shift scenarios (e.g., cross-device or cross-position), lacking comprehensive insights on the effectiveness of these algorithms. For instance, is OOD necessary to HAR? Which OOD algorithm performs the best? In this paper, we fill this gap by proposing HAROOD, a comprehensive benchmark for HAR in OOD settings. We define 4 OOD scenarios: cross-person, cross-position, cross-dataset, and cross-time, and build a testbed covering 6 datasets, 16 comparative methods (implemented with CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures), and two model selection protocols. Then, we conduct extensive experiments and present several findings for future research, e.g., no single method consistently outperforms others, highlighting substantial opportunity for advancement. Our codebase is highly modular and easy to extend for new datasets, algorithms, comparisons, and analysis, with the hope to facilitate the research in OOD-based HAR. Our implementation is released and can be found at https://github.com/AIFrontierLab/HAROOD.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10807v1,,False
Natural Language Interface for Firewall Configuration,11/12/2025,"F. Taghiyev, A. Aslanbayli","This paper presents the design and prototype implementation of a natural language interface for configuring enterprise firewalls. The framework allows administrators to express access control policies in plain language, which are then translated into vendor specific configurations. A compact schema bound intermediate representation separates human intent from device syntax and in the current prototype compiles to Palo Alto PAN OS command line configuration while remaining extensible to other platforms. Large language models are used only as assistive parsers that generate typed intermediate representation objects, while compilation and enforcement remain deterministic. The prototype integrates three validation layers, namely a static linter that checks structural and vendor specific constraints, a safety gate that blocks overly permissive rules such as any to any allows, and a Batfish based simulator that validates configuration syntax and referential integrity against a synthetic device model. The paper describes the architecture, implementation, and test methodology on synthetic network context datasets and discusses how this approach can evolve into a scalable auditable and human centered workflow for firewall policy management.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10789v1,,False
Evaluating Gemini Robotics Policies in a Veo World Simulator,11/12/2025,"Gemini Robotics Team, Coline Devin, Yilun Du, Debidatta Dwibedi, Ruiqi Gao, Abhishek Jindal, Thomas Kipf, Sean Kirmani, Fangchen Liu, Anirudha Majumdar, Andrew Marmon, Carolina Parada, Yulia Rubanova, Dhruv Shah, Vikas Sindhwani, Jie Tan, Fei Xia, Ted Xiao, Sherry Yang, Wenhao Yu, Allan Zhou","Generative world models hold significant potential for simulating interactions with visuomotor policies in varied environments. Frontier video models can enable generation of realistic observations and environment interactions in a scalable and general manner. However, the use of video models in robotics has been limited primarily to in-distribution evaluations, i.e., scenarios that are similar to ones used to train the policy or fine-tune the base video model. In this report, we demonstrate that video models can be used for the entire spectrum of policy evaluation use cases in robotics: from assessing nominal performance to out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, and probing physical and semantic safety. We introduce a generative evaluation system built upon a frontier video foundation model (Veo). The system is optimized to support robot action conditioning and multi-view consistency, while integrating generative image-editing and multi-view completion to synthesize realistic variations of real-world scenes along multiple axes of generalization. We demonstrate that the system preserves the base capabilities of the video model to enable accurate simulation of scenes that have been edited to include novel interaction objects, novel visual backgrounds, and novel distractor objects. This fidelity enables accurately predicting the relative performance of different policies in both nominal and OOD conditions, determining the relative impact of different axes of generalization on policy performance, and performing red teaming of policies to expose behaviors that violate physical or semantic safety constraints. We validate these capabilities through 1600+ real-world evaluations of eight Gemini Robotics policy checkpoints and five tasks for a bimanual manipulator.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10675v1,,False
Token Sample Complexity of Attention,11/12/2025,"Léa Bohbot, Cyril Letrouit, Gabriel Peyré, François-Xavier Vialard","As context windows in large language models continue to expand, it is essential to characterize how attention behaves at extreme sequence lengths. We introduce token-sample complexity: the rate at which attention computed on $n$ tokens converges to its infinite-token limit. We estimate finite-$n$ convergence bounds at two levels: pointwise uniform convergence of the attention map, and convergence of moments for the transformed token distribution. For compactly supported (and more generally sub-Gaussian) distributions, our first result shows that the attention map converges uniformly on a ball of radius $R$ at rate $C(R)/\sqrt{n}$, where $C(R)$ grows exponentially with $R$. For large $R$, this estimate loses practical value, and our second result addresses this issue by establishing convergence rates for the moments of the transformed distribution (the token output of the attention layer). In this case, the rate is $C'(R)/n^β$ with $β<\tfrac{1}{2}$, and $C'(R)$ depends polynomially on the size of the support of the distribution. The exponent $β$ depends on the attention geometry and the spectral properties of the tokens distribution. We also examine the regime in which the attention parameter tends to infinity and the softmax approaches a hardmax, and in this setting, we establish a logarithmic rate of convergence. Experiments on synthetic Gaussian data and real BERT models on Wikipedia text confirm our predictions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10656v1,,False
Phythesis: Physics-Guided Evolutionary Scene Synthesis for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design via LLMs,11/12/2025,"Minghao LI, Ruihang Wang, Rui Tan, Yonggang Wen","Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10611v1,,False
Volatility time series modeling by single-qubit quantum circuit learning,11/12/2025,Tetsuya Takaishi,"We employ single-qubit quantum circuit learning (QCL) to model the dynamics of volatility time series. To assess its effectiveness, we generate synthetic data using the Rational GARCH model, which is specifically designed to capture volatility asymmetry. Our results show that QCL-based volatility predictions preserve the negative return-volatility correlation, a hallmark of asymmetric volatility dynamics. Moreover, analysis of the Hurst exponent and multifractal characteristics indicates that the predicted series, like the original synthetic data, exhibits anti-persistent behavior and retains its multifractal structure.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10584v1,,False
LLM-Auction: Generative Auction towards LLM-Native Advertising,11/12/2025,"Chujie Zhao, Qun Hu, Shiping Song, Dagui Chen, Han Zhu, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng","The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) necessitates novel monetization strategies, among which LLM-native advertising has emerged as a promising paradigm by naturally integrating advertisement within LLM-generated responses. However, this paradigm fundamentally shifts the auction object from discrete ad slots to the distribution over LLM outputs, posing new challenges for designing auction mechanisms. Existing mechanisms for LLM-native advertising adopt frameworks that decouple auction and generation, which either ignore externalities or require multiple LLM inferences for ad allocation, rendering them impractical for industrial scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose LLM-Auction, which to the best of our knowledge is the first learning-based generative auction mechanism that integrates auction and LLM generation for LLM-native advertising. By formulating the allocation optimization as a preference alignment problem between LLM outputs and the mechanism's objective which reflects both advertisers' expected value and user experience, we introduce Iterative Reward-Preference Optimization (IRPO) algorithm that alternately optimizes the reward model and the LLM. This approach enables the LLM to inherently model allocation externalities without any extra inference cost. We further identify the allocation monotonicity and continuity of LLM-Auction, which allows us to prove that a simple first-price payment rule exhibits favorable incentive properties. Additionally, we design an LLM-as-a-judge simulation environment to facilitate large-scale data construction and enable comprehensive quantitative evaluation of the mechanism's performance. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that LLM-Auction significantly outperforms existing baselines in allocation efficiency, while achieving the desired mechanism properties.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10551v1,,False
Maximum Risk Minimization with Random Forests,11/12/2025,"Francesco Freni, Anya Fries, Linus Kühne, Markus Reichstein, Jonas Peters","We consider a regression setting where observations are collected in different environments modeled by different data distributions. The field of out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization aims to design methods that generalize better to test environments whose distributions differ from those observed during training. One line of such works has proposed to minimize the maximum risk across environments, a principle that we refer to as MaxRM (Maximum Risk Minimization). In this work, we introduce variants of random forests based on the principle of MaxRM. We provide computationally efficient algorithms and prove statistical consistency for our primary method. Our proposed method can be used with each of the following three risks: the mean squared error, the negative reward (which relates to the explained variance), and the regret (which quantifies the excess risk relative to the best predictor). For MaxRM with regret as the risk, we prove a novel out-of-sample guarantee over unseen test distributions. Finally, we evaluate the proposed methods on both simulated and real-world data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10445v1,,False
An M-Health Algorithmic Approach to Identify and Assess Physiotherapy Exercises in Real Time,11/12/2025,"Stylianos Kandylakis, Christos Orfanopoulos, Georgios Siolas, Panayiotis Tsanakas","This work presents an efficient algorithmic framework for real-time identification, classification, and evaluation of human physiotherapy exercises using mobile devices. The proposed method interprets a kinetic movement as a sequence of static poses, which are estimated from camera input using a pose-estimation neural network. Extracted body keypoints are transformed into trigonometric angle-based features and classified with lightweight supervised models to generate frame-level pose predictions and accuracy scores. To recognize full exercise movements and detect deviations from prescribed patterns, we employ a dynamic-programming scheme based on a modified Levenshtein distance algorithm, enabling robust sequence matching and localization of inaccuracies. The system operates entirely on the client side, ensuring scalability and real-time performance. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the methodology and highlights its applicability to remote physiotherapy supervision and m-health applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10437v1,,False
Translating Informal Proofs into Formal Proofs Using a Chain of States,11/12/2025,"Ziyu Wang, Bowen Yang, Shihao Zhou, Chenyi Li, Yuan Zhang, Bin Dong, Zaiwen Wen","We address the problem of translating informal mathematical proofs expressed in natural language into formal proofs in Lean4 under a constrained computational budget. Our approach is grounded in two key insights. First, informal proofs tend to proceed via a sequence of logical transitions - often implications or equivalences - without explicitly specifying intermediate results or auxiliary lemmas. In contrast, formal systems like Lean require an explicit representation of each proof state and the tactics that connect them. Second, each informal reasoning step can be viewed as an abstract transformation between proof states, but identifying the corresponding formal tactics often requires nontrivial domain knowledge and precise control over proof context. To bridge this gap, we propose a two stage framework. Rather than generating formal tactics directly, we first extract a Chain of States (CoS), a sequence of intermediate formal proof states aligned with the logical structure of the informal argument. We then generate tactics to transition between adjacent states in the CoS, thereby constructing the full formal proof. This intermediate representation significantly reduces the complexity of tactic generation and improves alignment with informal reasoning patterns. We build dedicated datasets and benchmarks for training and evaluation, and introduce an interactive framework to support tactic generation from formal states. Empirical results show that our method substantially outperforms existing baselines, achieving higher proof success rates.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10317v1,,False
EpiPlanAgent: Agentic Automated Epidemic Response Planning,11/12/2025,"Kangkun Mao, Fang Xu, Jinru Ding, Yidong Jiang, Yujun Yao, Yirong Chen, Junming Liu, Xiaoqin Wu, Qian Wu, Xiaoyan Huang, Jie Xu","Epidemic response planning is essential yet traditionally reliant on labor-intensive manual methods. This study aimed to design and evaluate EpiPlanAgent, an agent-based system using large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation and validation of digital emergency response plans.

A Kernel-based Resource-efficient Neural Surrogate for Multi-fidelity Prediction of Aerodynamic Field,11/12/2025,"Apurba Sarker, Reza T. Batley, Darshan Sarojini, Sourav Saha","Surrogate models provide fast alternatives to costly aerodynamic simulations and are extremely useful in design and optimization applications. This study proposes the use of a recent kernel-based neural surrogate, KHRONOS. In this work, we blend sparse high-fidelity (HF) data with low-fidelity (LF) information to predict aerodynamic fields under varying constraints in computational resources. Unlike traditional approaches, KHRONOS is built upon variational principles, interpolation theory, and tensor decomposition. These elements provide a mathematical basis for heavy pruning compared to dense neural networks. Using the AirfRANS dataset as a high-fidelity benchmark and NeuralFoil to generate low-fidelity counterparts, this work compares the performance of KHRONOS with three contemporary model architectures: a multilayer perceptron (MLP), a graph neural network (GNN), and a physics-informed neural network (PINN). We consider varying levels of high-fidelity data availability (0%, 10%, and 30%) and increasingly complex geometry parameterizations. These are used to predict the surface pressure coefficient distribution over the airfoil. Results indicate that, whilst all models eventually achieve comparable predictive accuracy, KHRONOS excels in resource-constrained conditions. In this domain, KHRONOS consistently requires orders of magnitude fewer trainable parameters and delivers much faster training and inference than contemporary dense neural networks at comparable accuracy. These findings highlight the potential of KHRONOS and similar architectures to balance accuracy and efficiency in multi-fidelity aerodynamic field prediction.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10287v1,,False
R^2-HGP: A Double-Regularized Gaussian Process for Heterogeneous Transfer Learning,11/12/2025,"Duo Wang, Xinming Wang, Chao Wang, Xiaowei Yue, Jianguo Wu","Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) models have attracted significant attention for their flexibility and uncertainty-quantification capabilities, and have been widely adopted in multi-source transfer learning scenarios due to their ability to capture inter-task correlations. However, they still face several challenges in transfer learning. First, the input spaces of the source and target domains are often heterogeneous, which makes direct knowledge transfer difficult. Second, potential prior knowledge and physical information are typically ignored during heterogeneous transfer, hampering the utilization of domain-specific insights and leading to unstable mappings. Third, inappropriate information sharing among target and sources can easily lead to negative transfer. Traditional models fail to address these issues in a unified way. To overcome these limitations, this paper proposes a Double-Regularized Heterogeneous Gaussian Process framework (R^2-HGP). Specifically, a trainable prior probability mapping model is first proposed to align the heterogeneous input domains. The resulting aligned inputs are treated as latent variables, upon which a multi-source transfer GP model is constructed and the entire structure is integrated into a novel conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) based framework. Physical insights is further incorporated as a regularization term to ensure that the alignment results adhere to known physical knowledge. Next, within the multi-source transfer GP model, a sparsity penalty is imposed on the transfer coefficients, enabling the model to adaptively select the most informative source outputs and suppress negative transfer. Extensive simulations and real-world engineering case studies validate the effectiveness of our R^2-HGP, demonstrating consistent superiority over state-of-the-art benchmarks across diverse evaluation metrics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10258v1,,False
Galaxy Phase-Space and Field-Level Cosmology: The Strength of Semi-Analytic Models,11/12/2025,"Natalí S. M. de Santi, Francisco Villaescusa-Navarro, Pablo Araya-Araya, Gabriella De Lucia, Fabio Fontanot, Lucia A. Perez, Manuel Arnés-Curto, Violeta Gonzalez-Perez, Ángel Chandro-Gómez, Rachel S. Somerville, Tiago Castro","Semi-analytic models are a widely used approach to simulate galaxy properties within a cosmological framework, relying on simplified yet physically motivated prescriptions. They have also proven to be an efficient alternative for generating accurate galaxy catalogs, offering a faster and less computationally expensive option compared to full hydrodynamical simulations. In this paper, we demonstrate that using only galaxy $3$D positions and radial velocities, we can train a graph neural network coupled to a moment neural network to obtain a robust machine learning based model capable of estimating the matter density parameters, $Ω_{\rm m}$, with a precision of approximately 10%. The network is trained on ($25 h^{-1}$Mpc)$^3$ volumes of galaxy catalogs from L-Galaxies and can successfully extrapolate its predictions to other semi-analytic models (GAEA, SC-SAM, and Shark) and, more remarkably, to hydrodynamical simulations (Astrid, SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and SWIFT-EAGLE). Our results show that the network is robust to variations in astrophysical and subgrid physics, cosmological and astrophysical parameters, and the different halo-profile treatments used across simulations. This suggests that the physical relationships encoded in the phase-space of semi-analytic models are largely independent of their specific physical prescriptions, reinforcing their potential as tools for the generation of realistic mock catalogs for cosmological parameter inference.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10222v1,,False
AutoMedic: An Automated Evaluation Framework for Clinical Conversational Agents with Medical Dataset Grounding,11/12/2025,"Gyutaek Oh, Sangjoon Park, Byung-Hoon Kim","Evaluating large language models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a critical issue for safe and trustworthy application of LLMs in the medical domain. Although a variety of static medical question-answering (QA) benchmarks have been proposed, many aspects remain underexplored, such as the effectiveness of LLMs in generating responses in dynamic, interactive clinical multi-turn conversation situations and the identification of multi-faceted evaluation strategies beyond simple accuracy. However, formally evaluating a dynamic, interactive clinical situation is hindered by its vast combinatorial space of possible patient states and interaction trajectories, making it difficult to standardize and quantitatively measure such scenarios. Here, we introduce AutoMedic, a multi-agent simulation framework that enables automated evaluation of LLMs as clinical conversational agents. AutoMedic transforms off-the-shelf static QA datasets into virtual patient profiles, enabling realistic and clinically grounded multi-turn clinical dialogues between LLM agents. The performance of various clinical conversational agents is then assessed based on our CARE metric, which provides a multi-faceted evaluation standard of clinical conversational accuracy, efficiency/strategy, empathy, and robustness. Our findings, validated by human experts, demonstrate the validity of AutoMedic as an automated evaluation framework for clinical conversational agents, offering practical guidelines for the effective development of LLMs in conversational medical applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.10195v1,,False
