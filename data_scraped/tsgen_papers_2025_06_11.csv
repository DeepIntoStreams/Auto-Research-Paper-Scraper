Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction Helps VLMs Understand Better,10/06/2025,"Dianyi Wang, Wei Song, Yikun Wang, Siyuan Wang, Kaicheng Yu, Zhongyu Wei, Jiaqi Wang","Typical large vision-language models (LVLMs) apply autoregressive supervision
solely to textual sequences, without fully incorporating the visual modality
into the learning process. This results in three key limitations: (1) an
inability to utilize images without accompanying captions, (2) the risk that
captions omit critical visual details, and (3) the challenge that certain
vision-centric content cannot be adequately conveyed through text. As a result,
current LVLMs often prioritize vision-to-language alignment while potentially
overlooking fine-grained visual information. While some prior works have
explored autoregressive image generation, effectively leveraging autoregressive
visual supervision to enhance image understanding remains an open challenge. In
this paper, we introduce Autoregressive Semantic Visual Reconstruction (ASVR),
which enables joint learning of visual and textual modalities within a unified
autoregressive framework. We show that autoregressively reconstructing the raw
visual appearance of images does not enhance and may even impair multimodal
understanding. In contrast, autoregressively reconstructing the semantic
representation of images consistently improves comprehension. Notably, we find
that even when models are given continuous image features as input, they can
effectively reconstruct discrete semantic tokens, resulting in stable and
consistent improvements across a wide range of multimodal understanding
benchmarks. Our approach delivers significant performance gains across varying
data scales (556k-2M) and types of LLM bacbones. Specifically, ASVR improves
LLaVA-1.5 by 5% in average scores across 14 multimodal benchmarks. The code is

Edit Flows: Flow Matching with Edit Operations,10/06/2025,"Marton Havasi, Brian Karrer, Itai Gat, Ricky T. Q. Chen","Autoregressive generative models naturally generate variable-length
sequences, while non-autoregressive models struggle, often imposing rigid,
token-wise structures. We propose Edit Flows, a non-autoregressive model that
overcomes these limitations by defining a discrete flow over sequences through
edit operations-insertions, deletions, and substitutions. By modeling these
operations within a Continuous-time Markov Chain over the sequence space, Edit
Flows enable flexible, position-relative generation that aligns more closely
with the structure of sequence data. Our training method leverages an expanded
state space with auxiliary variables, making the learning process efficient and
tractable. Empirical results show that Edit Flows outperforms both
autoregressive and mask models on image captioning and significantly
outperforms the mask construction in text and code generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09018v1,,False
Branched Schr√∂dinger Bridge Matching,10/06/2025,"Sophia Tang, Yinuo Zhang, Alexander Tong, Pranam Chatterjee","Predicting the intermediate trajectories between an initial and target
distribution is a central problem in generative modeling. Existing approaches,
such as flow matching and Schr\""odinger Bridge Matching, effectively learn
mappings between two distributions by modeling a single stochastic path.
However, these methods are inherently limited to unimodal transitions and
cannot capture branched or divergent evolution from a common origin to multiple
distinct outcomes. To address this, we introduce Branched Schr\""odinger Bridge
Matching (BranchSBM), a novel framework that learns branched Schr\""odinger
bridges. BranchSBM parameterizes multiple time-dependent velocity fields and
growth processes, enabling the representation of population-level divergence
into multiple terminal distributions. We show that BranchSBM is not only more
expressive but also essential for tasks involving multi-path surface
navigation, modeling cell fate bifurcations from homogeneous progenitor states,
and simulating diverging cellular responses to perturbations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.09007v1,,False
Propositional Logic for Probing Generalization in Neural Networks,10/06/2025,"Anna Langedijk, Jaap Jumelet, Willem Zuidema","The extent to which neural networks are able to acquire and represent
symbolic rules remains a key topic of research and debate. Much current work
focuses on the impressive capabilities of large language models, as well as
their often ill-understood failures on a wide range of reasoning tasks. In this
paper, in contrast, we investigate the generalization behavior of three key
neural architectures (Transformers, Graph Convolution Networks and LSTMs) in a
controlled task rooted in propositional logic. The task requires models to
generate satisfying assignments for logical formulas, making it a structured
and interpretable setting for studying compositionality. We introduce a
balanced extension of an existing dataset to eliminate superficial patterns and
enable testing on unseen operator combinations. Using this dataset, we evaluate
the ability of the three architectures to generalize beyond the training
distribution. While all models perform well in-distribution, we find that
generalization to unseen patterns, particularly those involving negation,
remains a significant challenge. Transformers fail to apply negation
compositionally, unless structural biases are introduced. Our findings
highlight persistent limitations in the ability of standard architectures to
learn systematic representations of logical operators, suggesting the need for
stronger inductive biases to support robust rule-based reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08978v1,,False
Tailored Architectures for Time Series Forecasting: Evaluating Deep Learning Models on Gaussian Process-Generated Data,10/06/2025,"Victoria Hankemeier, Malte Schilling","Developments in Deep Learning have significantly improved time series
forecasting by enabling more accurate modeling of complex temporal dependencies
inherent in sequential data. The effectiveness of such models is often
demonstrated on limited sets of specific real-world data. Although this allows
for comparative analysis, it still does not demonstrate how specific data
characteristics align with the architectural strengths of individual models.
Our research aims at uncovering clear connections between time series
characteristics and particular models. We introduce a novel dataset generated
using Gaussian Processes, specifically designed to display distinct, known
characteristics for targeted evaluations of model adaptability to them.
Furthermore, we present TimeFlex, a new model that incorporates a modular
architecture tailored to handle diverse temporal dynamics, including trends and
periodic patterns. This model is compared to current state-of-the-art models,
offering a deeper understanding of how models perform under varied time series
conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08977v1,,False
IntTrajSim: Trajectory Prediction for Simulating Multi-Vehicle driving at Signalized Intersections,10/06/2025,"Yash Ranjan, Rahul Sengupta, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka","Traffic simulators are widely used to study the operational efficiency of
road infrastructure, but their rule-based approach limits their ability to
mimic real-world driving behavior. Traffic intersections are critical
components of the road infrastructure, both in terms of safety risk (nearly 28%
of fatal crashes and 58% of nonfatal crashes happen at intersections) as well
as the operational efficiency of a road corridor. This raises an important
question: can we create a data-driven simulator that can mimic the macro- and
micro-statistics of the driving behavior at a traffic intersection? Deep
Generative Modeling-based trajectory prediction models provide a good starting
point to model the complex dynamics of vehicles at an intersection. But they
are not tested in a ""live"" micro-simulation scenario and are not evaluated on
traffic engineering-related metrics. In this study, we propose traffic
engineering-related metrics to evaluate generative trajectory prediction models
and provide a simulation-in-the-loop pipeline to do so. We also provide a
multi-headed self-attention-based trajectory prediction model that incorporates
the signal information, which outperforms our previous models on the evaluation
metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08957v1,,False
Product of Experts for Visual Generation,10/06/2025,"Yunzhi Zhang, Carson Murtuza-Lanier, Zizhang Li, Yilun Du, Jiajun Wu","Modern neural models capture rich priors and have complementary knowledge
over shared data domains, e.g., images and videos. Integrating diverse
knowledge from multiple sources -- including visual generative models, visual
language models, and sources with human-crafted knowledge such as graphics
engines and physics simulators -- remains under-explored. We propose a Product
of Experts (PoE) framework that performs inference-time knowledge composition
from heterogeneous models. This training-free approach samples from the product
distribution across experts via Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS). Our
framework shows practical benefits in image and video synthesis tasks, yielding
better controllability than monolithic methods and additionally providing
flexible user interfaces for specifying visual generation goals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08894v1,,False
InfoDPCCA: Information-Theoretic Dynamic Probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis,10/06/2025,"Shiqin Tang, Shujian Yu","Extracting meaningful latent representations from high-dimensional sequential
data is a crucial challenge in machine learning, with applications spanning
natural science and engineering. We introduce InfoDPCCA, a dynamic
probabilistic Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA) framework designed to model
two interdependent sequences of observations. InfoDPCCA leverages a novel
information-theoretic objective to extract a shared latent representation that
captures the mutual structure between the data streams and balances
representation compression and predictive sufficiency while also learning
separate latent components that encode information specific to each sequence.
Unlike prior dynamic CCA models, such as DPCCA, our approach explicitly
enforces the shared latent space to encode only the mutual information between
the sequences, improving interpretability and robustness. We further introduce
a two-step training scheme to bridge the gap between information-theoretic
representation learning and generative modeling, along with a residual
connection mechanism to enhance training stability. Through experiments on
synthetic and medical fMRI data, we demonstrate that InfoDPCCA excels as a tool
for representation learning. Code of InfoDPCCA is available at

FreqPolicy: Efficient Flow-based Visuomotor Policy via Frequency Consistency,10/06/2025,"Yifei Su, Ning Liu, Dong Chen, Zhen Zhao, Kun Wu, Meng Li, Zhiyuan Xu, Zhengping Che, Jian Tang","Generative modeling-based visuomotor policies have been widely adopted in
robotic manipulation attributed to their ability to model multimodal action
distributions. However, the high inference cost of multi-step sampling limits
their applicability in real-time robotic systems. To address this issue,
existing approaches accelerate the sampling process in generative
modeling-based visuomotor policies by adapting acceleration techniques
originally developed for image generation. Despite this progress, a major
distinction remains: image generation typically involves producing independent
samples without temporal dependencies, whereas robotic manipulation involves
generating time-series action trajectories that require continuity and temporal
coherence. To effectively exploit temporal information in robotic manipulation,
we propose FreqPolicy, a novel approach that first imposes frequency
consistency constraints on flow-based visuomotor policies. Our work enables the
action model to capture temporal structure effectively while supporting
efficient, high-quality one-step action generation. We introduce a frequency
consistency constraint that enforces alignment of frequency-domain action
features across different timesteps along the flow, thereby promoting
convergence of one-step action generation toward the target distribution. In
addition, we design an adaptive consistency loss to capture structural temporal
variations inherent in robotic manipulation tasks. We assess FreqPolicy on 53
tasks across 3 simulation benchmarks, proving its superiority over existing
one-step action generators. We further integrate FreqPolicy into the
vision-language-action (VLA) model and achieve acceleration without performance
degradation on the 40 tasks of Libero. Besides, we show efficiency and
effectiveness in real-world robotic scenarios with an inference frequency
93.5Hz. The code will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08822v1,,False
JoFormer (Journey-based Transformer): Theory and Empirical Analysis on the Tiny Shakespeare Dataset,10/06/2025,Mahesh Godavarti,"Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in sequence modeling, yet
effectively incorporating positional information remains a challenging and
active area of research. In this paper, we introduce JoFormer, a journey-based
Transformer architecture grounded in a recently proposed non-commutative
algebra for composing transformations across positions. JoFormer represents
relative positions through learnable directional transforms that are
sequentially composed along the input, thereby extending and generalizing
existing approaches based on relative position representations. We derive the
JoFormer attention mechanism from first principles and show that it subsumes
standard methods such as rotary transformations as special cases. To evaluate
its effectiveness, we compare JoFormer to the RoFormer baseline on the Tiny
Shakespeare character-level language modeling task. Our results demonstrate
that
  JoFormer consistently achieves lower perplexity and faster convergence,
highlighting the advantages of its more expressive, journey-based treatment of
position. Notably, the per-token JoFormer is still a primitive, conceptual
variant with layer-independent angles, yet it already demonstrates strong
performance-underscoring its promise as a proof of concept for more expressive
architectures. We conclude by discussing how JoFormer offers a principled
approach to integrating positional structure into Transformer architectures.

Flow Matching Meets PDEs: A Unified Framework for Physics-Constrained Generation,10/06/2025,"Giacomo Baldan, Qiang Liu, Alberto Guardone, Nils Thuerey","Generative machine learning methods, such as diffusion models and flow
matching, have shown great potential in modeling complex system behaviors and
building efficient surrogate models. However, these methods typically learn the
underlying physics implicitly from data. We propose Physics-Based Flow Matching
(PBFM), a novel generative framework that explicitly embeds physical
constraints, both PDE residuals and algebraic relations, into the flow matching
objective. We also introduce temporal unrolling at training time that improves
the accuracy of the final, noise-free sample prediction. Our method jointly
minimizes the flow matching loss and the physics-based residual loss without
requiring hyperparameter tuning of their relative weights. Additionally, we
analyze the role of the minimum noise level, $\sigma_{\min}$, in the context of
physical constraints and evaluate a stochastic sampling strategy that helps to
reduce physical residuals. Through extensive benchmarks on three representative
PDE problems, we show that our approach yields up to an $8\times$ more accurate
physical residuals compared to FM, while clearly outperforming existing
algorithms in terms of distributional accuracy. PBFM thus provides a principled
and efficient framework for surrogate modeling, uncertainty quantification, and
accelerated simulation in physics and engineering applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08604v1,,False
Diffusion-based Time Series Forecasting for Sewerage Systems,10/06/2025,"Nicholas A. Pearson, Francesca Cairoli, Luca Bortolussi, Davide Russo, Francesca Zanello","We introduce a novel deep learning approach that harnesses the power of
generative artificial intelligence to enhance the accuracy of contextual
forecasting in sewerage systems. By developing a diffusion-based model that
processes multivariate time series data, our system excels at capturing complex
correlations across diverse environmental signals, enabling robust predictions
even during extreme weather events. To strengthen the model's reliability, we
further calibrate its predictions with a conformal inference technique,
tailored for probabilistic time series data, ensuring that the resulting
prediction intervals are statistically reliable and cover the true target
values with a desired confidence level. Our empirical tests on real sewerage
system data confirm the model's exceptional capability to deliver reliable
contextual predictions, maintaining accuracy even under severe weather
conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08577v1,,False
Flow-Lenia: Emergent evolutionary dynamics in mass conservative continuous cellular automata,10/06/2025,"Erwan Plantec, Gautier Hamon, Mayalen Etcheverry, Bert Wang-Chak Chan, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer, Cl√©ment Moulin-Frier","Central to the artificial life endeavour is the creation of artificial
systems spontaneously generating properties found in the living world such as
autopoiesis, self-replication, evolution and open-endedness. While numerous
models and paradigms have been proposed, cellular automata (CA) have taken a
very important place in the field notably as they enable the study of
phenomenons like self-reproduction and autopoiesis. Continuous CA like Lenia
have been showed to produce life-like patterns reminiscent, on an aesthetic and
ontological point of view, of biological organisms we call creatures. We
propose in this paper Flow-Lenia, a mass conservative extension of Lenia. We
present experiments demonstrating its effectiveness in generating
spatially-localized patters (SLPs) with complex behaviors and show that the
update rule parameters can be optimized to generate complex creatures showing
behaviors of interest. Furthermore, we show that Flow-Lenia allows us to embed
the parameters of the model, defining the properties of the emerging patterns,
within its own dynamics thus allowing for multispecies simulations. By using
the evolutionary activity framework as well as other metrics, we shed light on
the emergent evolutionary dynamics taking place in this system.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.08569v1,10.1162/artl_a_00471,False
Teaching Physical Awareness to LLMs through Sounds,10/06/2025,"Weiguo Wang, Andy Nie, Wenrui Zhou, Yi Kai, Chengchen Hu","Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in text and
multimodal processing, yet they fundamentally lack physical
awareness--understanding of real-world physical phenomena. In this work, we
present ACORN, a framework that teaches LLMs physical awareness through sound,
focusing on fundamental physical phenomena like the Doppler effect, multipath
effect, and spatial relationships. To overcome data scarcity, ACORN introduce a
physics-based simulator combining real-world sound sources with controlled
physical channels to generate diverse training data. Using this simulator, we
build AQA-PHY, a comprehensive Audio Question-Answer dataset, and propose an
audio encoder that processes both magnitude and phase information. By
connecting our audio encoder to state-of-the-art LLMs, we demonstrate
reasonable results in both simulated and real-world tasks, such as

The interplay of robustness and generalization in quantum machine learning,10/06/2025,"Julian Berberich, Tobias Fellner, Christian Holm","While adversarial robustness and generalization have individually received
substantial attention in the recent literature on quantum machine learning,
their interplay is much less explored. In this chapter, we address this
interplay for variational quantum models, which were recently proposed as
function approximators in supervised learning. We discuss recent results
quantifying both robustness and generalization via Lipschitz bounds, which

Learning to Hear Broken Motors: Signature-Guided Data Augmentation for Induction-Motor Diagnostics,10/06/2025,"Saraa Ali, Aleksandr Khizhik, Stepan Svirin, Artem Ryzhikov, Denis Derkach","The application of machine learning (ML) algorithms in the intelligent

Signature-Guided Data Augmentation (SGDA), an unsupervised framework that
synthesizes physically plausible faults directly in the frequency domain of
healthy current signals. Guided by Motor Current Signature Analysis, SGDA
creates diverse and realistic anomalies without resorting to computationally
intensive simulations. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both

Re4MPC: Reactive Nonlinear MPC for Multi-model Motion Planning via Deep Reinforcement Learning,10/06/2025,"Ne≈üet √únver Akmandor, Sarvesh Prajapati, Mark Zolotas, Ta≈ükƒ±n Padƒ±r","Traditional motion planning methods for robots with many degrees-of-freedom,

computationally efficient manner by reactively selecting the model, cost, and

robot state. The policy for this reactive decision-making is learned via a Deep
Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework. We introduce a mathematical formulation
to integrate NMPC into this DRL framework. To validate our methodology and
design choices, we evaluate DRL training and test outcomes in a physics-based

Private Evolution Converges,10/06/2025,"Tom√°s Gonz√°lez, Giulia Fanti, Aaditya Ramdas","Private Evolution (PE) is a promising training-free method for differentially
private (DP) synthetic data generation. While it achieves strong performance in
some domains (e.g., images and text), its behavior in others (e.g., tabular
data) is less consistent. To date, the only theoretical analysis of the
convergence of PE depends on unrealistic assumptions about both the algorithm's
behavior and the structure of the sensitive dataset. In this work, we develop a
new theoretical framework to explain PE's practical behavior and identify
sufficient conditions for its convergence. For $d$-dimensional sensitive
datasets with $n$ data points from a bounded domain, we prove that PE produces
an $(\epsilon, \delta)$-DP synthetic dataset with expected 1-Wasserstein
distance of order $\tilde{O}(d(n\epsilon)^{-1/d})$ from the original,
establishing worst-case convergence of the algorithm as $n \to \infty$. Our
analysis extends to general Banach spaces as well. We also connect PE to the
