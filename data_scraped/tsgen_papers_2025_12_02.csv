RoaD: Rollouts as Demonstrations for Closed-Loop Supervised Fine-Tuning of Autonomous Driving Policies,01/12/2025,"Guillermo Garcia-Cobo, Maximilian Igl, Peter Karkus, Zhejun Zhang, Michael Watson, Yuxiao Chen, Boris Ivanovic, Marco Pavone","Autonomous driving policies are typically trained via open-loop behavior cloning of human demonstrations. However, such policies suffer from covariate shift when deployed in closed loop, leading to compounding errors. We introduce Rollouts as Demonstrations (RoaD), a simple and efficient method to mitigate covariate shift by leveraging the policy's own closed-loop rollouts as additional training data. During rollout generation, RoaD incorporates expert guidance to bias trajectories toward high-quality behavior, producing informative yet realistic demonstrations for fine-tuning. This approach enables robust closed-loop adaptation with orders of magnitude less data than reinforcement learning, and avoids restrictive assumptions of prior closed-loop supervised fine-tuning (CL-SFT) methods, allowing broader applications domains including end-to-end driving. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RoaD on WOSAC, a large-scale traffic simulation benchmark, where it performs similar or better than the prior CL-SFT method; and in AlpaSim, a high-fidelity neural reconstruction-based simulator for end-to-end driving, where it improves driving score by 41\% and reduces collisions by 54\%.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01993v1,,False
Forecasting in Offline Reinforcement Learning for Non-stationary Environments,01/12/2025,"Suzan Ece Ada, Georg Martius, Emre Ugur, Erhan Oztop","Offline Reinforcement Learning (RL) provides a promising avenue for training policies from pre-collected datasets when gathering additional interaction data is infeasible. However, existing offline RL methods often assume stationarity or only consider synthetic perturbations at test time, assumptions that often fail in real-world scenarios characterized by abrupt, time-varying offsets. These offsets can lead to partial observability, causing agents to misperceive their true state and degrade performance. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Forecasting in Non-stationary Offline RL (FORL), a framework that unifies (i) conditional diffusion-based candidate state generation, trained without presupposing any specific pattern of future non-stationarity, and (ii) zero-shot time-series foundation models. FORL targets environments prone to unexpected, potentially non-Markovian offsets, requiring robust agent performance from the onset of each episode. Empirical evaluations on offline RL benchmarks, augmented with real-world time-series data to simulate realistic non-stationarity, demonstrate that FORL consistently improves performance compared to competitive baselines. By integrating zero-shot forecasting with the agent's experience, we aim to bridge the gap between offline RL and the complexities of real-world, non-stationary environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01987v1,,False
KV Pareto: Systems-Level Optimization of KV Cache and Model Compression for Long Context Inference,01/12/2025,"Sai Gokhale, Devleena Das, Rajeev Patwari, Ashish Sirasao, Elliott Delaye","Long-context Large Language Models (LLMs) face significant memory bottlenecks during inference due to the linear growth of key-value (KV) cache with sequence length. While individual optimization techniques like KV cache quantization, chunked prefill, and model weight quantization have shown promise, their joint effects and optimal configurations for edge deployment remain underexplored. We introduce KV Pareto, a systems-level framework that systematically maps the trade-off frontier between total memory consumption and task accuracy across these three complementary optimization techniques. Our framework evaluates multiple LLM architectures (Qwen, Llama, Mistral) with varying KV quantization schemes (int2/4/8, mixed-precision), granularities (per-token, per-tensor, per-block), and 4-bit weight quantization via AWQ. Our framework identifies model-specific Pareto-optimal configurations that achieve 68-78% total memory reduction with minimal (1-3%) accuracy degradation on long-context tasks. We additionally verify the selected frontiers on additional benchmarks of Needle-in-a-Haystack, GSM8k and MMLU as well as extended context lengths of up to 128k to demonstrate the practical need of joint optimization for efficient LLM inference.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01953v1,,False
GrndCtrl: Grounding World Models via Self-Supervised Reward Alignment,01/12/2025,"Haoyang He, Jay Patrikar, Dong-Ki Kim, Max Smith, Daniel McGann, Ali-akbar Agha-mohammadi, Shayegan Omidshafiei, Sebastian Scherer","Recent advances in video world modeling have enabled large-scale generative models to simulate embodied environments with high visual fidelity, providing strong priors for prediction, planning, and control. Yet, despite their realism, these models often lack geometric grounding, limiting their use in navigation tasks that require spatial coherence and long-horizon stability. We introduce Reinforcement Learning with World Grounding (RLWG), a self-supervised post-training framework that aligns pretrained world models with a physically verifiable structure through geometric and perceptual rewards. Analogous to reinforcement learning from verifiable feedback (RLVR) in language models, RLWG can use multiple rewards that measure pose cycle-consistency, depth reprojection, and temporal coherence. We instantiate this framework with GrndCtrl, a reward-aligned adaptation method based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), yielding world models that maintain stable trajectories, consistent geometry, and reliable rollouts for embodied navigation. Like post-training alignment in large language models, GrndCtrl leverages verifiable rewards to bridge generative pretraining and grounded behavior, achieving superior spatial coherence and navigation stability over supervised fine-tuning in outdoor environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01952v1,,False
Real-World Robot Control by Deep Active Inference With a Temporally Hierarchical World Model,01/12/2025,"Kentaro Fujii, Shingo Murata","Robots in uncertain real-world environments must perform both goal-directed and exploratory actions. However, most deep learning-based control methods neglect exploration and struggle under uncertainty. To address this, we adopt deep active inference, a framework that accounts for human goal-directed and exploratory actions. Yet, conventional deep active inference approaches face challenges due to limited environmental representation capacity and high computational cost in action selection. We propose a novel deep active inference framework that consists of a world model, an action model, and an abstract world model. The world model encodes environmental dynamics into hidden state representations at slow and fast timescales. The action model compresses action sequences into abstract actions using vector quantization, and the abstract world model predicts future slow states conditioned on the abstract action, enabling low-cost action selection. We evaluate the framework on object-manipulation tasks with a real-world robot. Results show that it achieves high success rates across diverse manipulation tasks and switches between goal-directed and exploratory actions in uncertain settings, while making action selection computationally tractable. These findings highlight the importance of modeling multiple timescale dynamics and abstracting actions and state transitions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01924v1,10.1109/LRA.2025.3636032,False
Domain-Decomposed Graph Neural Network Surrogate Modeling for Ice Sheets,01/12/2025,"Adrienne M. Propp, Mauro Perego, Eric C. Cyr, Anthony Gruber, Amanda A. Howard, Alexander Heinlein, Panos Stinis, Daniel M. Tartakovsky","Accurate yet efficient surrogate models are essential for large-scale simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly for uncertainty quantification (UQ) tasks that demand hundreds or thousands of evaluations. We develop a physics-inspired graph neural network (GNN) surrogate that operates directly on unstructured meshes and leverages the flexibility of graph attention. To improve both training efficiency and generalization properties of the model, we introduce a domain decomposition (DD) strategy that partitions the mesh into subdomains, trains local GNN surrogates in parallel, and aggregates their predictions. We then employ transfer learning to fine-tune models across subdomains, accelerating training and improving accuracy in data-limited settings. Applied to ice sheet simulations, our approach accurately predicts full-field velocities on high-resolution meshes, substantially reduces training time relative to training a single global surrogate model, and provides a ripe foundation for UQ objectives. Our results demonstrate that graph-based DD, combined with transfer learning, provides a scalable and reliable pathway for training GNN surrogates on massive PDE-governed systems, with broad potential for application beyond ice sheet dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01888v1,,False
Predicting Human Chess Moves: An AI Assisted Analysis of Chess Games Using Skill-group Specific n-gram Language Models,01/12/2025,"Daren Zhong, Dingcheng Huang, Clayton Greenberg","Chess, a deterministic game with perfect information, has long served as a benchmark for studying strategic decision-making and artificial intelligence. Traditional chess engines or tools for analysis primarily focus on calculating optimal moves, often neglecting the variability inherent in human chess playing, particularly across different skill levels.
  To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel and computationally efficient move prediction framework that approaches chess move prediction as a behavioral analysis task. The framework employs n-gram language models to capture move patterns characteristic of specific player skill levels. By dividing players into seven distinct skill groups, from novice to expert, we trained separate models using data from the open-source chess platform Lichess. The framework dynamically selects the most suitable model for prediction tasks and generates player moves based on preceding sequences.
  Evaluation on real-world game data demonstrates that the model selector module within the framework can classify skill levels with an accuracy of up to 31.7\% when utilizing early game information (16 half-moves). The move prediction framework also shows substantial accuracy improvements, with our Selector Assisted Accuracy being up to 39.1\% more accurate than our benchmark accuracy. The computational efficiency of the framework further enhances its suitability for real-time chess analysis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01880v1,,False
Testing Transformer Learnability on the Arithmetic Sequence of Rooted Trees,01/12/2025,"Alessandro Breccia, Federica Gerace, Marco Lippi, Gabriele Sicuro, Pierluigi Contucci","We study whether a Large Language Model can learn the deterministic sequence of trees generated by the iterated prime factorization of the natural numbers. Each integer is mapped into a rooted planar tree and the resulting sequence $ \mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$ defines an arithmetic text with measurable statistical structure. A transformer network (the GPT-2 architecture) is trained from scratch on the first $10^{11}$ elements to subsequently test its predictive ability under next-word and masked-word prediction tasks. Our results show that the model partially learns the internal grammar of $\mathbb{N}\mathcal{T}$, capturing non-trivial regularities and correlations. This suggests that learnability may extend beyond empirical data to the very structure of arithmetic.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01870v1,,False
Dimension-free error estimate for diffusion model and optimal scheduling,01/12/2025,"Valentin de Bortoli, Romuald Elie, Anna Kazeykina, Zhenjie Ren, Jiacheng Zhang","Diffusion generative models have emerged as powerful tools for producing synthetic data from an empirically observed distribution. A common approach involves simulating the time-reversal of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process initialized at the true data distribution. Since the score function associated with the OU process is typically unknown, it is approximated using a trained neural network. This approximation, along with finite time simulation, time discretization and statistical approximation, introduce several sources of error whose impact on the generated samples must be carefully understood. Previous analyses have quantified the error between the generated and the true data distributions in terms of Wasserstein distance or Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. However, both metrics present limitations: KL divergence requires absolute continuity between distributions, while Wasserstein distance, though more general, leads to error bounds that scale poorly with dimension, rendering them impractical in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we derive an explicit, dimension-free bound on the discrepancy between the generated and the true data distributions. The bound is expressed in terms of a smooth test functional with bounded first and second derivatives. The key novelty lies in the use of this weaker, functional metric to obtain dimension-independent guarantees, at the cost of higher regularity on the test functions. As an application, we formulate and solve a variational problem to minimize the time-discretization error, leading to the derivation of an optimal time-scheduling strategy for the reverse-time diffusion. Interestingly, this scheduler has appeared previously in the literature in a different context; our analysis provides a new justification for its optimality, now grounded in minimizing the discretization bias in generative sampling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01820v1,,False
Common Structure Discovery in Collections of Bipartite Networks: Application to Pollination Systems,01/12/2025,"Louis Lacoste, Pierre Barbillon, Sophie Donnet","Bipartite networks are widely used to encode the ecological interactions. Being able to compare the organization of bipartite networks is a first step toward a better understanding of how environmental factors shape community structure and resilience. Yet current methods for structure detection in bipartite networks overlook shared patterns across collections of networks. We introduce the \emph{colBiSBM}, a family of probabilistic models for collections of bipartite networks that extends the classical Latent Block Model (LBM). The proposed framework assumes that networks are independent realizations of a shared mesoscale structure, encoded through common inter-block connectivity parameters. We establish identifiability conditions for the different variants of \emph{colBiSBM} and develop a variational EM algorithm for parameter estimation, coupled with an adaptation of the Integrated Classification Likelihood (ICL) criterion for model selection. We demonstrate how our approach can be used to classify networks based on their topology or organization. Simulation studies highlight the ability of \emph{colBiSBM} to recover common structures, improve clustering performance, and enhance link prediction by borrowing strength across networks. An application to plant--pollinator networks highlights how the method uncovers shared ecological roles and partitions networks into sub-collections with similar connectivity patterns. These results illustrate the methodological and practical advantages of joint modeling over separate network analyses in the study of bipartite systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01716v1,,False
StreamGaze: Gaze-Guided Temporal Reasoning and Proactive Understanding in Streaming Videos,01/12/2025,"Daeun Lee, Subhojyoti Mukherjee, Branislav Kveton, Ryan A. Rossi, Viet Dac Lai, Seunghyun Yoon, Trung Bui, Franck Dernoncourt, Mohit Bansal","Streaming video understanding requires models not only to process temporally incoming frames, but also to anticipate user intention for realistic applications like AR glasses. While prior streaming benchmarks evaluate temporal reasoning, none measure whether MLLMs can interpret or leverage human gaze signals within a streaming setting. To fill this gap, we introduce StreamGaze, the first benchmark designed to evaluate how effectively MLLMs use gaze for temporal and proactive reasoning in streaming videos. StreamGaze introduces gaze-guided past, present, and proactive tasks that comprehensively evaluate streaming video understanding. These tasks assess whether models can use real-time gaze to follow shifting attention and infer user intentions from only past and currently observed frames. To build StreamGaze, we develop a gaze-video QA generation pipeline that aligns egocentric videos with raw gaze trajectories via fixation extraction, region-specific visual prompting, and scanpath construction. This pipeline produces spatio-temporally grounded QA pairs that closely reflect human perceptual dynamics. Across all StreamGaze tasks, we observe substantial performance gaps between state-of-the-art MLLMs and human performance, revealing fundamental limitations in gaze-based temporal reasoning, intention modeling, and proactive prediction. We further provide detailed analyses of gaze-prompting strategies, reasoning behaviors, and task-specific failure modes, offering deeper insight into why current MLLMs struggle and what capabilities future models must develop. All data and code will be publicly released to support continued research in gaze-guided streaming video understanding.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01707v1,,False
A unified framework for geometry-independent operator learning in cardiac electrophysiology simulations,01/12/2025,"Bei Zhou, Cesare Corrado, Shuang Qian, Maximilian Balmus, Angela W. C. Lee, Cristobal Rodero, Marco J. W. Gotte, Luuk H. G. A. Hopman, Mengyun Qiao, Steven Niederer","Accurate maps of atrial electrical activation are essential for personalised treatment of arrhythmias, yet biophysically detailed simulations remain computationally intensive for real-time clinical use or population-scale analyses. Here we introduce a geometry-independent operator-learning framework that predicts local activation time (LAT) fields across diverse left atrial anatomies with near-instantaneous inference. We generated a dataset of 308,700 simulations using a GPU-accelerated electrophysiology solver, systematically varying multiple pacing sites and physiologically varied conduction properties across 147 patient-specific geometries derived from two independent clinical cohorts. All anatomical and functional data are expressed in a Universal Atrium Coordinate system, providing a consistent representation that decouples electrophysiological patterns from mesh topology. Within this coordinate space, we designed a neural operator with a vision-transformer backbone to learn the mapping from structural and electrophysiological inputs to LAT fields. With a mean prediction error of 5.1 ms over a 455 ms maximum simulation time, the model outperforms established operator-learning approaches and performs inference in 0.12 ms per sample. Our framework establishes a general strategy for learning domain-invariant biophysical mappings across variable anatomical domains and enables integration of computational electrophysiology into real-time and large-scale clinical workflows.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01702v1,,False
ICAD-LLM: One-for-All Anomaly Detection via In-Context Learning with Large Language Models,01/12/2025,"Zhongyuan Wu, Jingyuan Wang, Zexuan Cheng, Yilong Zhou, Weizhi Wang, Juhua Pu, Chao Li, Changqing Ma","Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task of critical importance across numerous domains. Current systems increasingly operate in rapidly evolving environments that generate diverse yet interconnected data modalities -- such as time series, system logs, and tabular records -- as exemplified by modern IT systems. Effective AD methods in such environments must therefore possess two critical capabilities: (1) the ability to handle heterogeneous data formats within a unified framework, allowing the model to process and detect multiple modalities in a consistent manner during anomalous events; (2) a strong generalization ability to quickly adapt to new scenarios without extensive retraining. However, most existing methods fall short of these requirements, as they typically focus on single modalities and lack the flexibility to generalize across domains. To address this gap, we introduce a novel paradigm: In-Context Anomaly Detection (ICAD), where anomalies are defined by their dissimilarity to a relevant reference set of normal samples. Under this paradigm, we propose ICAD-LLM, a unified AD framework leveraging Large Language Models' in-context learning abilities to process heterogeneous data within a single model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ICAD-LLM achieves competitive performance with task-specific AD methods and exhibits strong generalization to previously unseen tasks, which substantially reduces deployment costs and enables rapid adaptation to new environments. To the best of our knowledge, ICAD-LLM is the first model capable of handling anomaly detection tasks across diverse domains and modalities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01672v1,,False
Scaling and context steer LLMs along the same computational path as the human brain,01/12/2025,"Joséphine Raugel, Stéphane d'Ascoli, Jérémy Rapin, Valentin Wyart, Jean-Rémi King","Recent studies suggest that the representations learned by large language models (LLMs) are partially aligned to those of the human brain. However, whether and why this alignment score arises from a similar sequence of computations remains elusive. In this study, we explore this question by examining temporally-resolved brain signals of participants listening to 10 hours of an audiobook. We study these neural dynamics jointly with a benchmark encompassing 22 LLMs varying in size and architecture type. Our analyses confirm that LLMs and the brain generate representations in a similar order: specifically, activations in the initial layers of LLMs tend to best align with early brain responses, while the deeper layers of LLMs tend to best align with later brain responses. This brain-LLM alignment is consistent across transformers and recurrent architectures. However, its emergence depends on both model size and context length. Overall, this study sheds light on the sequential nature of computations and the factors underlying the partial convergence between biological and artificial neural networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01591v1,,False
RoleMotion: A Large-Scale Dataset towards Robust Scene-Specific Role-Playing Motion Synthesis with Fine-grained Descriptions,01/12/2025,"Junran Peng, Yiheng Huang, Silei Shen, Zeji Wei, Jingwei Yang, Baojie Wang, Yonghao He, Chuanchen Luo, Man Zhang, Xucheng Yin, Wei Sui","In this paper, we introduce RoleMotion, a large-scale human motion dataset that encompasses a wealth of role-playing and functional motion data tailored to fit various specific scenes. Existing text datasets are mainly constructed decentrally as amalgamation of assorted subsets that their data are nonfunctional and isolated to work together to cover social activities in various scenes. Also, the quality of motion data is inconsistent, and textual annotation lacks fine-grained details in these datasets. In contrast, RoleMotion is meticulously designed and collected with a particular focus on scenes and roles. The dataset features 25 classic scenes, 110 functional roles, over 500 behaviors, and 10296 high-quality human motion sequences of body and hands, annotated with 27831 fine-grained text descriptions. We build an evaluator stronger than existing counterparts, prove its reliability, and evaluate various text-to-motion methods on our dataset. Finally, we explore the interplay of motion generation of body and hands. Experimental results demonstrate the high-quality and functionality of our dataset on text-driven whole-body generation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01582v1,,False
From Black Hole to Galaxy: Neural Operator: Framework for Accretion and Feedback Dynamics,01/12/2025,"Nihaal Bhojwani, Chuwei Wang, Hai-Yang Wang, Chang Sun, Elias R. Most, Anima Anandkumar","Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01576v1,,False
Reconstructing Multi-Scale Physical Fields from Extremely Sparse Measurements with an Autoencoder-Diffusion Cascade,01/12/2025,"Letian Yi, Tingpeng Zhang, Mingyuan Zhou, Guannan Wang, Quanke Su, Zhilu Lai","Reconstructing full fields from extremely sparse and random measurements is a longstanding ill-posed inverse problem. A powerful framework for addressing such challenges is hierarchical probabilistic modeling, where uncertainty is represented by intermediate variables and resolved through marginalization during inference. Inspired by this principle, we propose Cascaded Sensing (Cas-Sensing), a hierarchical reconstruction framework that integrates an autoencoder-diffusion cascade. First, a neural operator-based functional autoencoder reconstructs the dominant structures of the original field - including large-scale components and geometric boundaries - from arbitrary sparse inputs, serving as an intermediate variable. Then, a conditional diffusion model, trained with a mask-cascade strategy, generates fine-scale details conditioned on these large-scale structures. To further enhance fidelity, measurement consistency is enforced via the manifold constrained gradient based on Bayesian posterior sampling during the generation process. This cascaded pipeline substantially alleviates ill-posedness, delivering accurate and robust reconstructions. Experiments on both simulation and real-world datasets demonstrate that Cas-Sensing generalizes well across varying sensor configurations and geometric boundaries, making it a promising tool for practical deployment in scientific and engineering applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01572v1,,False
Deep FlexQP: Accelerated Nonlinear Programming via Deep Unfolding,01/12/2025,"Alex Oshin, Rahul Vodeb Ghosh, Augustinos D. Saravanos, Evangelos A. Theodorou","We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01565v1,,False
Neural Networks for Predicting Permeability Tensors of 2D Porous Media: Comparison of Convolution- and Transformer-based Architectures,01/12/2025,"Sigurd Vargdal, Paula Reis, Henrik Andersen Sveinsson, Gaute Linga","Permeability is a central concept in the macroscopic description of flow through porous media, with applications spanning from oil recovery to hydrology. Traditional methods for determining the permeability tensor involving flow simulations or experiments can be time consuming and resource-intensive, while analytical methods, e.g., based on the Kozeny-Carman equation, may be too simplistic for accurate prediction based on pore-scale features. In this work, we explore deep learning as a more efficient alternative for predicting the permeability tensor based on two-dimensional binary images of porous media, segmented into solid ($1$) and void ($0$) regions. We generate a dataset of 24,000 synthetic random periodic porous media samples with specified porosity and characteristic length scale. Using Lattice-Boltzmann simulations, we compute the permeability tensor for flow through these samples with values spanning three orders of magnitude. We evaluate three families of image-based deep learning models: ResNet (ResNet-$50$ and ResNet-$101$), Vision Transformers (ViT-T$16$ and ViT-S$16$) and ConvNeXt (Tiny and Small). To improve model generalisation, we employ techniques such as weight decay, learning rate scheduling, and data augmentation. The effect of data augmentation and dataset size on model performance is studied, and we find that they generally increase the accuracy of permeability predictions. We also show that ConvNeXt and ResNet converge faster than ViT and degrade in performance if trained for too long. ConvNeXt-Small achieved the highest $R^2$ score of $0.99460$ on $4,000$ unseen test samples. These findings underscore the potential to use image-based neural networks to predict permeability tensors accurately.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01517v1,,False
SynthStrategy: Extracting and Formalizing Latent Strategic Insights from LLMs in Organic Chemistry,01/12/2025,"Daniel Armstrong, Zlatko Jončev, Andres M Bran, Philippe Schwaller","Modern computer-assisted synthesis planning (CASP) systems show promises at generating chemically valid reaction steps but struggle to incorporate strategic considerations such as convergent assembly, protecting group minimization, and optimal ring-forming sequences. We introduce a methodology that leverages Large Language Models to distill synthetic knowledge into code. Our system analyzes synthesis routes and translates strategic principles into Python functions representing diverse strategic and tactical rules, such as strategic functional group interconversions and ring construction strategies. By formalizing this knowledge as verifiable code rather than simple heuristics, we create testable, interpretable representations of synthetic strategy. We release the complete codebase and the USPTO-ST dataset -- synthesis routes annotated with strategic tags. This framework unlocks a novel capability for CASP: natural language-based route retrieval, achieving 75\% Top-3 accuracy on our benchmark. We further validate our library through temporal analysis of historical trends and chemically intuitive route clustering that offers more granular partitioning than common previous methods. This work bridges the tactical-strategic divide in CASP, enabling specification, search, and evaluation of routes by strategic criteria rather than structure alone.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01507v1,,False
Does Flatness imply Generalization for Logistic Loss in Univariate Two-Layer ReLU Network?,01/12/2025,"Dan Qiao, Yu-Xiang Wang","We consider the problem of generalization of arbitrarily overparameterized two-layer ReLU Neural Networks with univariate input. Recent work showed that under square loss, flat solutions (motivated by flat / stable minima and Edge of Stability phenomenon) provably cannot overfit, but it remains unclear whether the same phenomenon holds for logistic loss. This is a puzzling open problem because existing work on logistic loss shows that gradient descent with increasing step size converges to interpolating solutions (at infinity, for the margin-separable cases). In this paper, we prove that the \emph{flatness implied generalization} is more delicate under logistic loss. On the positive side, we show that flat solutions enjoy near-optimal generalization bounds within a region between the left-most and right-most \emph{uncertain} sets determined by each candidate solution. On the negative side, we show that there exist arbitrarily flat yet overfitting solutions at infinity that are (falsely) certain everywhere, thus certifying that flatness alone is insufficient for generalization in general. We demonstrate the effects predicted by our theory in a well-controlled simulation study.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01473v1,,False
Automated Risk-of-Bias Assessment of Randomized Controlled Trials: A First Look at a GEPA-trained Programmatic Prompting Framework,01/12/2025,"Lingbo Li, Anuradha Mathrani, Teo Susnjak","Assessing risk of bias (RoB) in randomized controlled trials is essential for trustworthy evidence synthesis, but the process is resource-intensive and prone to variability across reviewers. Large language models (LLMs) offer a route to automation, but existing methods rely on manually engineered prompts that are difficult to reproduce, generalize, or evaluate. This study introduces a programmable RoB assessment pipeline that replaces ad-hoc prompt design with structured, code-based optimization using DSPy and its GEPA module. GEPA refines LLM reasoning through Pareto-guided search and produces inspectable execution traces, enabling transparent replication of every step in the optimization process. We evaluated the method on 100 RCTs from published meta-analyses across seven RoB domains. GEPA-generated prompts were applied to both open-weight models (Mistral Small 3.1 with GPT-oss-20b) and commercial models (GPT-5 Nano and GPT-5 Mini). In domains with clearer methodological reporting, such as Random Sequence Generation, GEPA-generated prompts performed best, with similar results for Allocation Concealment and Blinding of Participants, while the commercial model performed slightly better overall. We also compared GEPA with three manually designed prompts using Claude 3.5 Sonnet. GEPA achieved the highest overall accuracy and improved performance by 30%-40% in Random Sequence Generation and Selective Reporting, and showed generally comparable, competitively aligned performance in the other domains relative to manual prompts. These findings suggest that GEPA can produce consistent and reproducible prompts for RoB assessment, supporting the structured and principled use of LLMs in evidence synthesis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01452v1,,False
"A Selective Temporal Hamming distance to find patterns in state transition event timeseries, at scale",01/12/2025,"Sylvain Marié, Pablo Knecht","Discrete event systems are present both in observations of nature, socio economical sciences, and industrial systems. Standard analysis approaches do not usually exploit their dual event / state nature: signals are either modeled as transition event sequences, emphasizing event order alignment, or as categorical or ordinal state timeseries, usually resampled a distorting and costly operation as the observation period and number of events grow. In this work we define state transition event timeseries (STE-ts) and propose a new Selective Temporal Hamming distance (STH) leveraging both transition time and duration-in-state, avoiding costly and distorting resampling on large databases. STH generalizes both resampled Hamming and Jaccard metrics with better precision and computation time, and an ability to focus on multiple states of interest. We validate these benefits on simulated and real-world datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01440v1,,False
A Self-explainable Model of Long Time Series by Extracting Informative Structured Causal Patterns,01/12/2025,"Ziqian Wang, Yuxiao Cheng, Jinli Suo","Explainability is essential for neural networks that model long time series, yet most existing explainable AI methods only produce point-wise importance scores and fail to capture temporal structures such as trends, cycles, and regime changes. This limitation weakens human interpretability and trust in long-horizon models. To address these issues, we identify four key requirements for interpretable time-series modeling: temporal continuity, pattern-centric explanation, causal disentanglement, and faithfulness to the model's inference process. We propose EXCAP, a unified framework that satisfies all four requirements. EXCAP combines an attention-based segmenter that extracts coherent temporal patterns, a causally structured decoder guided by a pre-trained causal graph, and a latent aggregation mechanism that enforces representation stability. Our theoretical analysis shows that EXCAP provides smooth and stable explanations over time and is robust to perturbations in causal masks. Extensive experiments on classification and forecasting benchmarks demonstrate that EXCAP achieves strong predictive accuracy while generating coherent and causally grounded explanations.

RE-LLM: Integrating Large Language Models into Renewable Energy Systems,01/12/2025,"Ali Forootani, Mohammad Sadr, Danial Esmaeili Aliabadi, Daniela Thraen","Energy system models are increasingly employed to guide long-term planning in multi-sectoral environments where decisions span electricity, heat, transport, land use, and industry. While these models provide rigorous quantitative insights, their outputs are often highly technical, making them difficult to interpret for non-expert stakeholders such as policymakers, planners, and the public. This communication gap limits the accessibility and practical impact of scenario-based modeling, particularly as energy transitions grow more complex with rising shares of renewables, sectoral integration, and deep uncertainties. To address this challenge, we propose the Renewable Energy Large Language Model (RE-LLM), a hybrid framework that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) directly into the energy system modeling workflow. RE-LLM combines three core elements: (i) optimization-based scenario exploration, (ii) machine learning surrogates that accelerate computationally intensive simulations, and (iii) LLM-powered natural language generation that translates complex results into clear, stakeholder-oriented explanations. This integrated design not only reduces computational burden but also enhances inter-pretability, enabling real-time reasoning about trade-offs, sensitivities, and policy implications. The framework is adaptable across different optimization platforms and energy system models, ensuring broad applicability beyond the case study presented. By merging speed, rigor, and interpretability, RE-LLM advances a new paradigm of human-centric energy modeling. It enables interactive, multilingual, and accessible engagement with future energy pathways, ultimately bridging the final gap between data-driven analysis and actionable decision-making for sustainable transitions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01392v1,,False
Stabilizing Reinforcement Learning with LLMs: Formulation and Practices,01/12/2025,"Chujie Zheng, Kai Dang, Bowen Yu, Mingze Li, Huiqiang Jiang, Junrong Lin, Yuqiong Liu, An Yang, Jingren Zhou, Junyang Lin","This paper proposes a novel formulation for reinforcement learning (RL) with large language models, explaining why and under what conditions the true sequence-level reward can be optimized via a surrogate token-level objective in policy gradient methods such as REINFORCE. Specifically, through a first-order approximation, we show that this surrogate becomes increasingly valid only when both the training-inference discrepancy and policy staleness are minimized. This insight provides a principled explanation for the crucial role of several widely adopted techniques in stabilizing RL training, including importance sampling correction, clipping, and particularly Routing Replay for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. Through extensive experiments with a 30B MoE model totaling hundreds of thousands of GPU hours, we show that for on-policy training, the basic policy gradient algorithm with importance sampling correction achieves the highest training stability. When off-policy updates are introduced to accelerate convergence, combining clipping and Routing Replay becomes essential to mitigate the instability caused by policy staleness. Notably, once training is stabilized, prolonged optimization consistently yields comparable final performance regardless of cold-start initialization. We hope that the shared insights and the developed recipes for stable RL training will facilitate future research.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01374v1,,False
SocialDriveGen: Generating Diverse Traffic Scenarios with Controllable Social Interactions,01/12/2025,"Jiaguo Tian, Zhengbang Zhu, Shenyu Zhang, Li Xu, Bo Zheng, Xu Liu, Weiji Peng, Shizeng Yao, Weinan Zhang","The generation of realistic and diverse traffic scenarios in simulation is essential for developing and evaluating autonomous driving systems. However, most simulation frameworks rely on rule-based or simplified models for scene generation, which lack the fidelity and diversity needed to represent real-world driving. While recent advances in generative modeling produce more realistic and context-aware traffic interactions, they often overlook how social preferences influence driving behavior. SocialDriveGen addresses this gap through a hierarchical framework that integrates semantic reasoning and social preference modeling with generative trajectory synthesis. By modeling egoism and altruism as complementary social dimensions, our framework enables controllable diversity in driver personalities and interaction styles. Experiments on the Argoverse 2 dataset show that SocialDriveGen generates diverse, high-fidelity traffic scenarios spanning cooperative to adversarial behaviors, significantly enhancing policy robustness and generalization to rare or high-risk situations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01363v1,,False
The Necessity of Imperfection:Reversing Model Collapse via Simulating Cognitive Boundedness,01/12/2025,Zhongjie Jiang,"Although synthetic data is widely promoted as a remedy, its prevailing production paradigm -- one optimizing for statistical smoothness -- systematically removes the long-tail, cognitively grounded irregularities that characterize human text. Prolonged training on such statistically optimal but cognitively impoverished data accelerates model collapse.
  This paper proposes a paradigm shift: instead of imitating the surface properties of data, we simulate the cognitive processes that generate human text. We introduce the Prompt-driven Cognitive Computing Framework (PMCSF), whose core consists of a Cognitive State Decoder (CSD) that reverse-engineers unstructured text into structured cognitive vectors, and a Cognitive Text Encoder (CTE) that re-materializes these states into text enriched with human-typical imperfections via mathematically defined Cognitive Perturbation Operators.
  The framework is validated through a two-stage objective evaluation pipeline. First, in cognitive codec verification, CTE text yields a Jensen-Shannon divergence of 0.0614 from human text (vs. 0.4431 for standard LLM output), passes double-blind professional media review, and achieves an intraclass correlation coefficient ICC > 0.9 for cognitive profile alignment across heterogeneous models. Second, in functional gain evaluation, isomorphic stress tests in the A-share market show that strategies incorporating CTE-generated data reduce maximum drawdown by 47.4% during the 2015 crash and deliver 8.6% Defensive Alpha, exceeding transaction costs by a factor of 33.
  Our findings demonstrate that modelling human cognitive limitations -- not copying surface data -- enables synthetic data with genuine functional gain, offering a viable technical pathway toward resolving the AI data-collapse crisis.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01354v1,,False
FOD-S2R: A FOD Dataset for Sim2Real Transfer Learning based Object Detection,01/12/2025,"Ashish Vashist, Qiranul Saadiyean, Suresh Sundaram, Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula","Foreign Object Debris (FOD) within aircraft fuel tanks presents critical safety hazards including fuel contamination, system malfunctions, and increased maintenance costs. Despite the severity of these risks, there is a notable lack of dedicated datasets for the complex, enclosed environments found inside fuel tanks. To bridge this gap, we present a novel dataset, FOD-S2R, composed of real and synthetic images of the FOD within a simulated aircraft fuel tank. Unlike existing datasets that focus on external or open-air environments, our dataset is the first to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the real-world FOD detection performance in confined, closed structures. The real-world subset consists of 3,114 high-resolution HD images captured in a controlled fuel tank replica, while the synthetic subset includes 3,137 images generated using Unreal Engine. The dataset is composed of various Field of views (FOV), object distances, lighting conditions, color, and object size. Prior research has demonstrated that synthetic data can reduce reliance on extensive real-world annotations and improve the generalizability of vision models. Thus, we benchmark several state-of-the-art object detection models and demonstrate that introducing synthetic data improves the detection accuracy and generalization to real-world conditions. These experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic data in enhancing the model performance and narrowing the Sim2Real gap, providing a valuable foundation for developing automated FOD detection systems for aviation maintenance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01315v1,,False
RoboDriveVLM: A Novel Benchmark and Baseline towards Robust Vision-Language Models for Autonomous Driving,01/12/2025,"Dacheng Liao, Mengshi Qi, Peng Shu, Zhining Zhang, Yuxin Lin, Liang Liu, Huadong Ma","Current Vision-Language Model (VLM)-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems often leverage large language models to generate driving decisions directly based on their understanding of the current scene. However, such systems introduce multiple risks in real-world driving scenarios. To evaluate whether VLMs are truly viable for autonomous driving, we introduce RoboDriveBench, the first robustness benchmark focused on end-to-end trajectory prediction tasks. This benchmark systematically evaluates two critical categories of real-world challenges for VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems through 11 simulated scenarios encompassing various corruption types, including 6 scenarios of sensor corruption caused by environmental variations, along with 5 cases of prompt corruption resulting from human intervention and data transmission failures. Each corruption type includes 250 unique driving scenarios and 5,689 frames, resulting in 64,559 total trajectory prediction cases per evaluation. To overcome these real-world challenges, we propose a novel VLM-based autonomous driving framework called RoboDriveVLM, which enhances robustness by mapping more multimodal data-e.g., lidar and radar-into a unified latent space. Furthermore, we introduce a new Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) method based on cross-modal knowledge distillation to improve the robustness of VLM-based autonomous driving systems. Through extensive experiments, our work highlights the limitations of current VLM-based end-to-end autonomous driving systems and provides a more reliable solution for real-world deployment.

S$^2$-MLLM: Boosting Spatial Reasoning Capability of MLLMs for 3D Visual Grounding with Structural Guidance,01/12/2025,"Beining Xu, Siting Zhu, Zhao Jin, Junxian Li, Hesheng Wang","3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) focuses on locating objects in 3D scenes based on natural language descriptions, serving as a fundamental task for embodied AI and robotics. Recent advances in Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have motivated research into extending them to 3DVG. However, MLLMs primarily process 2D visual inputs and struggle with understanding 3D spatial structure of scenes solely from these limited perspectives. Existing methods mainly utilize viewpoint-dependent rendering of reconstructed point clouds to provide explicit structural guidance for MLLMs in 3DVG tasks, leading to inefficiency and limited spatial reasoning. To address this issue, we propose S$^2$-MLLM, an efficient framework that enhances spatial reasoning in MLLMs through implicit spatial reasoning. We introduce a spatial guidance strategy that leverages the structure awareness of feed-forward 3D reconstruction. By acquiring 3D structural understanding during training, our model can implicitly reason about 3D scenes without relying on inefficient point cloud reconstruction. Moreover, we propose a structure-enhanced module (SE), which first employs intra-view and inter-view attention mechanisms to capture dependencies within views and correspondences across views. The module further integrates multi-level position encoding to associate visual representations with spatial positions and viewpoint information, enabling more accurate structural understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that S$^2$-MLLM unifies superior performance, generalization, and efficiency, achieving significant performance over existing methods across the ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D datasets. Code will be available upon acceptance.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01223v1,,False
Neural Network Optimal Power Flow via Energy Gradient Flow and Unified Dynamics,01/12/2025,Xuezhi Liu,"Optimal Power Flow (OPF) is a core optimization problem in power system operation and planning, aiming to minimize generation costs while satisfying physical constraints such as power flow equations, generator limits, and voltage limits. Traditional OPF solving methods typically employ iterative optimization algorithms (such as interior point methods, sequential quadratic programming, etc.), with limitations including low computational efficiency, initial value sensitivity, and low batch computation efficiency. Most existing deep learning-based OPF methods rely on supervised learning, requiring pre-solving large numbers of cases, and have difficulty guaranteeing physical consistency. This paper proposes an Optimal Power Flow solving method based on neural network dynamics and energy gradient flow, transforming OPF problems into energy minimization problems. By constructing an energy function to measure the degree of deviation from the constraint manifold, and guiding networks to learn optimal solutions that simultaneously satisfy power flow constraints and minimize costs through gradient flow. Neural networks are trained unsupervised by directly minimizing physical residuals, requiring no labeled data, achieving true ""end-to-end"" physics-constrained learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01219v1,,False
A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Algorithms for Electricity Price Forecasting with LIME-Based Interpretability,01/12/2025,"Xuanyi Zhao, Jiawen Ding, Xueting Huang, Yibo Zhang","With the rapid development of electricity markets, price volatility has significantly increased, making accurate forecasting crucial for power system operations and market decisions. Traditional linear models cannot capture the complex nonlinear characteristics of electricity pricing, necessitating advanced machine learning approaches. This study compares eight machine learning models using Spanish electricity market data, integrating consumption, generation, and meteorological variables. The models evaluated include linear regression, ridge regression, decision tree, KNN, random forest, gradient boosting, SVR, and XGBoost. Results show that KNN achieves the best performance with R^2 of 0.865, MAE of 3.556, and RMSE of 5.240.

Learning to Reconstruct Temperature Field from Sparse Observations with Implicit Physics Priors,01/12/2025,"Shihang Li, Zhiqiang Gong, Weien Zhou, Yue Gao, Wen Yao","Accurate reconstruction of temperature field of heat-source systems (TFR-HSS) is crucial for thermal monitoring and reliability assessment in engineering applications such as electronic devices and aerospace structures. However, the high cost of measurement acquisition and the substantial distributional shifts in temperature field across varying conditions present significant challenges for developing reconstruction models with robust generalization capabilities. Existing DNNs-based methods typically formulate TFR-HSS as a one-to-one regression problem based solely on target sparse measurements, without effectively leveraging reference simulation data that implicitly encode thermal knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose IPTR, an implicit physics-guided temperature field reconstruction framework that introduces sparse monitoring-temperature field pair from reference simulations as priors to enrich physical understanding. To integrate both reference and target information, we design a dual physics embedding module consisting of two complementary branches: an implicit physics-guided branch employing cross-attention to distill latent physics from the reference data, and an auxiliary encoding branch based on Fourier layers to capture the spatial characteristics of the target observation. The fused representation is then decoded to reconstruct the full temperature field. Extensive experiments under single-condition, multi-condition, and few-shot settings demonstrate that IPTR consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy and strong generalization capability.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01196v1,,False
TempPerturb-Eval: On the Joint Effects of Internal Temperature and External Perturbations in RAG Robustness,01/12/2025,"Yongxin Zhou, Philippe Mulhem, Didier Schwab","The evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically examines retrieval quality and generation parameters like temperature in isolation, overlooking their interaction. This work presents a systematic investigation of how text perturbations (simulating noisy retrieval) interact with temperature settings across multiple LLM runs. We propose a comprehensive RAG Perturbation-Temperature Analysis Framework that subjects retrieved documents to three distinct perturbation types across varying temperature settings. Through extensive experiments on HotpotQA with both open-source and proprietary LLMs, we demonstrate that performance degradation follows distinct patterns: high-temperature settings consistently amplify vulnerability to perturbations, while certain perturbation types exhibit non-linear sensitivity across the temperature range. Our work yields three key contributions: (1) a diagnostic benchmark for assessing RAG robustness, (2) an analytical framework for quantifying perturbation-temperature interactions, and (3) practical guidelines for model selection and parameter tuning under noisy retrieval conditions.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01183v1,,False
High-dimensional Mean-Field Games by Particle-based Flow Matching,01/12/2025,"Jiajia Yu, Junghwan Lee, Yao Xie, Xiuyuan Cheng","Mean-field games (MFGs) study the Nash equilibrium of systems with a continuum of interacting agents, which can be formulated as the fixed-point of optimal control problems. They provide a unified framework for a variety of applications, including optimal transport (OT) and generative models. Despite their broad applicability, solving high-dimensional MFGs remains a significant challenge due to fundamental computational and analytical obstacles. In this work, we propose a particle-based deep Flow Matching (FM) method to tackle high-dimensional MFG computation. In each iteration of our proximal fixed-point scheme, particles are updated using first-order information, and a flow neural network is trained to match the velocity of the sample trajectories in a simulation-free manner. Theoretically, in the optimal control setting, we prove that our scheme converges to a stationary point sublinearly, and upgrade to linear (exponential) convergence under additional convexity assumptions. Our proof uses FM to induce an Eulerian coordinate (density-based) from a Lagrangian one (particle-based), and this also leads to certain equivalence results between the two formulations for MFGs when the Eulerian solution is sufficiently regular. Our method demonstrates promising performance on non-potential MFGs and high-dimensional OT problems cast as MFGs through a relaxed terminal-cost formulation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01172v1,,False
2D-ThermAl: Physics-Informed Framework for Thermal Analysis of Circuits using Generative AI,01/12/2025,"Soumyadeep Chandra, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Kaushik Roy","Thermal analysis is increasingly critical in modern integrated circuits, where non-uniform power dissipation and high transistor densities can cause rapid temperature spikes and reliability concerns. Traditional methods, such as FEM-based simulations offer high accuracy but computationally prohibitive for early-stage design, often requiring multiple iterative redesign cycles to resolve late-stage thermal failures. To address these challenges, we propose 'ThermAl', a physics-informed generative AI framework which effectively identifies heat sources and estimates full-chip transient and steady-state thermal distributions directly from input activity profiles. ThermAl employs a hybrid U-Net architecture enhanced with positional encoding and a Boltzmann regularizer to maintain physical fidelity. Our model is trained on an extensive dataset of heat dissipation maps, ranging from simple logic gates (e.g., inverters, NAND, XOR) to complex designs, generated via COMSOL. Experimental results demonstrate that ThermAl delivers precise temperature mappings for large circuits, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of only 0.71°C, and outperforms conventional FEM tools by running up to ~200 times faster. We analyze performance across diverse layouts and workloads, and discuss its applicability to large-scale EDA workflows. While thermal reliability assessments often extend beyond 85°C for post-layout signoff, our focus here is on early-stage hotspot detection and thermal pattern learning. To ensure generalization beyond the nominal operating range 25-55°C, we additionally performed cross-validation on an extended dataset spanning 25-95°C maintaining a high accuracy (<2.2% full-scale RMSE) even under elevated temperature conditions representative of peak power and stress scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.01163v1,,False
