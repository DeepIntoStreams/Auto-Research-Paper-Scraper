Parameter-free representations outperform single-cell foundation models on downstream benchmarks,18/02/2026,"Huan Souza, Pankaj Mehta","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data exhibit strong and reproducible statistical structure. This has motivated the development of large-scale foundation models, such as TranscriptFormer, that use transformer-based architectures to learn a generative model for gene expression by embedding genes into a latent vector space. These embeddings have been used to obtain state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on downstream tasks such as cell-type classification, disease-state prediction, and cross-species learning. Here, we ask whether similar performance can be achieved without utilizing computationally intensive deep learning-based representations. Using simple, interpretable pipelines that rely on careful normalization and linear methods, we obtain SOTA or near SOTA performance across multiple benchmarks commonly used to evaluate single-cell foundation models, including outperforming foundation models on out-of-distribution tasks involving novel cell types and organisms absent from the training data. Our findings highlight the need for rigorous benchmarking and suggest that the biology of cell identity can be captured by simple linear representations of single cell gene expression data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16696v1,,False
Synthetic-Powered Multiple Testing with FDR Control,18/02/2026,"Yonghoon Lee, Meshi Bashari, Edgar Dobriban, Yaniv Romano","Multiple hypothesis testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control is a fundamental problem in statistical inference, with broad applications in genomics, drug screening, and outlier detection. In many such settings, researchers may have access not only to real experimental observations but also to auxiliary or synthetic data -- from past, related experiments or generated by generative models -- that can provide additional evidence about the hypotheses of interest. We introduce SynthBH, a synthetic-powered multiple testing procedure that safely leverages such synthetic data. We prove that SynthBH guarantees finite-sample, distribution-free FDR control under a mild PRDS-type positive dependence condition, without requiring the pooled-data p-values to be valid under the null. The proposed method adapts to the (unknown) quality of the synthetic data: it enhances the sample efficiency and may boost the power when synthetic data are of high quality, while controlling the FDR at a user-specified level regardless of their quality. We demonstrate the empirical performance of SynthBH on tabular outlier detection benchmarks and on genomic analyses of drug-cancer sensitivity associations, and further study its properties through controlled experiments on simulated data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16690v1,,False
Enhanced Diffusion Sampling: Efficient Rare Event Sampling and Free Energy Calculation with Diffusion Models,18/02/2026,"Yu Xie, Ludwig Winkler, Lixin Sun, Sarah Lewis, Adam E. Foster, José Jiménez Luna, Tim Hempel, Michael Gastegger, Yaoyi Chen, Iryna Zaporozhets, Cecilia Clementi, Christopher M. Bishop, Frank Noé","The rare-event sampling problem has long been the central limiting factor in molecular dynamics (MD), especially in biomolecular simulation. Recently, diffusion models such as BioEmu have emerged as powerful equilibrium samplers that generate independent samples from complex molecular distributions, eliminating the cost of sampling rare transition events. However, a sampling problem remains when computing observables that rely on states which are rare in equilibrium, for example folding free energies. Here, we introduce enhanced diffusion sampling, enabling efficient exploration of rare-event regions while preserving unbiased thermodynamic estimators. The key idea is to perform quantitatively accurate steering protocols to generate biased ensembles and subsequently recover equilibrium statistics via exact reweighting. We instantiate our framework in three algorithms: UmbrellaDiff (umbrella sampling with diffusion models), $Δ$G-Diff (free-energy differences via tilted ensembles), and MetaDiff (a batchwise analogue for metadynamics). Across toy systems, protein folding landscapes and folding free energies, our methods achieve fast, accurate, and scalable estimation of equilibrium properties within GPU-minutes to hours per system -- closing the rare-event sampling gap that remained after the advent of diffusion-model equilibrium samplers.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16634v1,,False
A Systematic Evaluation of Sample-Level Tokenization Strategies for MEG Foundation Models,18/02/2026,"SungJun Cho, Chetan Gohil, Rukuang Huang, Oiwi Parker Jones, Mark W. Woolrich","Recent success in natural language processing has motivated growing interest in large-scale foundation models for neuroimaging data. Such models often require discretization of continuous neural time series data, a process referred to as 'tokenization'. However, the impact of different tokenization strategies for neural data is currently poorly understood. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of sample-level tokenization strategies for transformer-based large neuroimaging models (LNMs) applied to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data. We compare learnable and non-learnable tokenizers by examining their signal reconstruction fidelity and their impact on subsequent foundation modeling performance (token prediction, biological plausibility of generated data, preservation of subject-specific information, and performance on downstream tasks). For the learnable tokenizer, we introduce a novel approach based on an autoencoder. Experiments were conducted on three publicly available MEG datasets spanning different acquisition sites, scanners, and experimental paradigms. Our results show that both learnable and non-learnable discretization schemes achieve high reconstruction accuracy and broadly comparable performance across most evaluation criteria, suggesting that simple fixed sample-level tokenization strategies can be used in the development of neural foundation models. The code is available at https://github.com/OHBA-analysis/Cho2026_Tokenizer.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16626v1,,False
RIDER: 3D RNA Inverse Design with Reinforcement Learning-Guided Diffusion,18/02/2026,"Tianmeng Hu, Yongzheng Cui, Biao Luo, Ke Li","The inverse design of RNA three-dimensional (3D) structures is crucial for engineering functional RNAs in synthetic biology and therapeutics. While recent deep learning approaches have advanced this field, they are typically optimized and evaluated using native sequence recovery, which is a limited surrogate for structural fidelity, since different sequences can fold into similar 3D structures and high recovery does not necessarily indicate correct folding. To address this limitation, we propose RIDER, an RNA Inverse DEsign framework with Reinforcement learning that directly optimizes for 3D structural similarity. First, we develop and pre-train a GNN-based generative diffusion model conditioned on the target 3D structure, achieving a 9% improvement in native sequence recovery over state-of-the-art methods. Then, we fine-tune the model with an improved policy gradient algorithm using four task-specific reward functions based on 3D self-consistency metrics. Experimental results show that RIDER improves structural similarity by over 100% across all metrics and discovers designs that are distinct from native sequences.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16548v1,,False
Optimal training-conditional regret for online conformal prediction,18/02/2026,"Jiadong Liang, Zhimei Ren, Yuxin Chen","We study online conformal prediction for non-stationary data streams subject to unknown distribution drift. While most prior work studied this problem under adversarial settings and/or assessed performance in terms of gaps of time-averaged marginal coverage, we instead evaluate performance through training-conditional cumulative regret. We specifically focus on independently generated data with two types of distribution shift: abrupt change points and smooth drift.
  When non-conformity score functions are pretrained on an independent dataset, we propose a split-conformal style algorithm that leverages drift detection to adaptively update calibration sets, which provably achieves minimax-optimal regret. When non-conformity scores are instead trained online, we develop a full-conformal style algorithm that again incorporates drift detection to handle non-stationarity; this approach relies on stability - rather than permutation symmetry - of the model-fitting algorithm, which is often better suited to online learning under evolving environments. We establish non-asymptotic regret guarantees for our online full conformal algorithm, which match the minimax lower bound under appropriate restrictions on the prediction sets. Numerical experiments corroborate our theoretical findings.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16537v1,,False
HPMixer: Hierarchical Patching for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,18/02/2026,"Jung Min Choi, Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi, Lars Schmidt-Thieme","In long-term multivariate time series forecasting, effectively capturing both periodic patterns and residual dynamics is essential. To address this within standard deep learning benchmark settings, we propose the Hierarchical Patching Mixer (HPMixer), which models periodicity and residuals in a decoupled yet complementary manner. The periodic component utilizes a learnable cycle module [7] enhanced with a nonlinear channel-wise MLP for greater expressiveness. The residual component is processed through a Learnable Stationary Wavelet Transform (LSWT) to extract stable, shift-invariant frequency-domain representations. Subsequently, a channel-mixing encoder models explicit inter-channel dependencies, while a two-level non-overlapping hierarchical patching mechanism captures coarse- and fine-scale residual variations. By integrating decoupled periodicity modeling with structured, multi-scale residual learning, HPMixer provides an effective framework. Extensive experiments on standard multivariate benchmarks demonstrate that HPMixer achieves competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to recent baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16468v1,,False
Hardware-accelerated graph neural networks: an alternative approach for neuromorphic event-based audio classification and keyword spotting on SoC FPGA,18/02/2026,"Kamil Jeziorek, Piotr Wzorek, Krzysztof Blachut, Hiroshi Nakano, Manon Dampfhoffer, Thomas Mesquida, Hiroaki Nishi, Thomas Dalgaty, Tomasz Kryjak","As the volume of data recorded by embedded edge sensors increases, particularly from neuromorphic devices producing discrete event streams, there is a growing need for hardware-aware neural architectures that enable efficient, low-latency, and energy-conscious local processing. We present an FPGA implementation of event-graph neural networks for audio processing. We utilise an artificial cochlea that converts time-series signals into sparse event data, reducing memory and computation costs. Our architecture was implemented on a SoC FPGA and evaluated on two open-source datasets. For classification task, our baseline floating-point model achieves 92.7% accuracy on SHD dataset - only 2.4% below the state of the art - while requiring over 10x and 67x fewer parameters. On SSC, our models achieve 66.9-71.0% accuracy. Compared to FPGA-based spiking neural networks, our quantised model reaches 92.3% accuracy, outperforming them by up to 19.3% while reducing resource usage and latency. For SSC, we report the first hardware-accelerated evaluation. We further demonstrate the first end-to-end FPGA implementation of event-audio keyword spotting, combining graph convolutional layers with recurrent sequence modelling. The system achieves up to 95% word-end detection accuracy, with only 10.53 microsecond latency and 1.18 W power consumption, establishing a strong benchmark for energy-efficient event-driven KWS.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16442v1,,False
Variable-Length Semantic IDs for Recommender Systems,18/02/2026,Kirill Khrylchenko,"Generative models are increasingly used in recommender systems, both for modeling user behavior as event sequences and for integrating large language models into recommendation pipelines. A key challenge in this setting is the extremely large cardinality of item spaces, which makes training generative models difficult and introduces a vocabulary gap between natural language and item identifiers. Semantic identifiers (semantic IDs), which represent items as sequences of low-cardinality tokens, have recently emerged as an effective solution to this problem.
  However, existing approaches generate semantic identifiers of fixed length, assigning the same description length to all items. This is inefficient, misaligned with natural language, and ignores the highly skewed frequency structure of real-world catalogs, where popular items and rare long-tail items exhibit fundamentally different information requirements. In parallel, the emergent communication literature studies how agents develop discrete communication protocols, often producing variable-length messages in which frequent concepts receive shorter descriptions. Despite the conceptual similarity, these ideas have not been systematically adopted in recommender systems.
  In this work, we bridge recommender systems and emergent communication by introducing variable-length semantic identifiers for recommendation. We propose a discrete variational autoencoder with Gumbel-Softmax reparameterization that learns item representations of adaptive length under a principled probabilistic framework, avoiding the instability of REINFORCE-based training and the fixed-length constraints of prior semantic ID methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16375v1,,False
Multi-agent cooperation through in-context co-player inference,18/02/2026,"Marissa A. Weis, Maciej Wołczyk, Rajai Nasser, Rif A. Saurous, Blaise Agüera y Arcas, João Sacramento, Alexander Meulemans","Achieving cooperation among self-interested agents remains a fundamental challenge in multi-agent reinforcement learning. Recent work showed that mutual cooperation can be induced between ""learning-aware"" agents that account for and shape the learning dynamics of their co-players. However, existing approaches typically rely on hardcoded, often inconsistent, assumptions about co-player learning rules or enforce a strict separation between ""naive learners"" updating on fast timescales and ""meta-learners"" observing these updates. Here, we demonstrate that the in-context learning capabilities of sequence models allow for co-player learning awareness without requiring hardcoded assumptions or explicit timescale separation. We show that training sequence model agents against a diverse distribution of co-players naturally induces in-context best-response strategies, effectively functioning as learning algorithms on the fast intra-episode timescale. We find that the cooperative mechanism identified in prior work-where vulnerability to extortion drives mutual shaping-emerges naturally in this setting: in-context adaptation renders agents vulnerable to extortion, and the resulting mutual pressure to shape the opponent's in-context learning dynamics resolves into the learning of cooperative behavior. Our results suggest that standard decentralized reinforcement learning on sequence models combined with co-player diversity provides a scalable path to learning cooperative behaviors.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16301v1,,False
Factored Latent Action World Models,18/02/2026,"Zizhao Wang, Chang Shi, Jiaheng Hu, Kevin Rohling, Roberto Martín-Martín, Amy Zhang, Peter Stone","Learning latent actions from action-free video has emerged as a powerful paradigm for scaling up controllable world model learning. Latent actions provide a natural interface for users to iteratively generate and manipulate videos. However, most existing approaches rely on monolithic inverse and forward dynamics models that learn a single latent action to control the entire scene, and therefore struggle in complex environments where multiple entities act simultaneously. This paper introduces Factored Latent Action Model (FLAM), a factored dynamics framework that decomposes the scene into independent factors, each inferring its own latent action and predicting its own next-step factor value. This factorized structure enables more accurate modeling of complex multi-entity dynamics and improves video generation quality in action-free video settings compared to monolithic models. Based on experiments on both simulation and real-world multi-entity datasets, we find that FLAM outperforms prior work in prediction accuracy and representation quality, and facilitates downstream policy learning, demonstrating the benefits of factorized latent action models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16229v1,,False
Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework for Time Series Forecasting and Classification,18/02/2026,"Xu Zhang, Peng Wang, Yichen Li, Wei Wang","Time series data are prone to noise in various domains, and training samples may contain low-predictability patterns that deviate from the normal data distribution, leading to training instability or convergence to poor local minima. Therefore, mitigating the adverse effects of low-predictability samples is crucial for time series analysis tasks such as time series forecasting (TSF) and time series classification (TSC). While many deep learning models have achieved promising performance, few consider how to identify and penalize low-predictability samples to improve model performance from the training perspective. To fill this gap, we propose a general Amortized Predictability-aware Training Framework (APTF) for both TSF and TSC. APTF introduces two key designs that enable the model to focus on high-predictability samples while still learning appropriately from low-predictability ones: (i) a Hierarchical Predictability-aware Loss (HPL) that dynamically identifies low-predictability samples and progressively expands their loss penalty as training evolves, and (ii) an amortization model that mitigates predictability estimation errors caused by model bias, further enhancing HPL's effectiveness. The code is available at https://github.com/Meteor-Stars/APTF.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16224v1,,False
Training-Free Adaptation of Diffusion Models via Doob's $h$-Transform,18/02/2026,"Qijie Zhu, Zeqi Ye, Han Liu, Zhaoran Wang, Minshuo Chen","Adaptation methods have been a workhorse for unlocking the transformative power of pre-trained diffusion models in diverse applications. Existing approaches often abstract adaptation objectives as a reward function and steer diffusion models to generate high-reward samples. However, these approaches can incur high computational overhead due to additional training, or rely on stringent assumptions on the reward such as differentiability. Moreover, despite their empirical success, theoretical justification and guarantees are seldom established. In this paper, we propose DOIT (Doob-Oriented Inference-time Transformation), a training-free and computationally efficient adaptation method that applies to generic, non-differentiable rewards. The key framework underlying our method is a measure transport formulation that seeks to transport the pre-trained generative distribution to a high-reward target distribution. We leverage Doob's $h$-transform to realize this transport, which induces a dynamic correction to the diffusion sampling process and enables efficient simulation-based computation without modifying the pre-trained model. Theoretically, we establish a high probability convergence guarantee to the target high-reward distribution via characterizing the approximation error in the dynamic Doob's correction. Empirically, on D4RL offline RL benchmarks, our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines while preserving sampling efficiency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16198v1,,False
EnterpriseGym Corecraft: Training Generalizable Agents on High-Fidelity RL Environments,18/02/2026,"Sushant Mehta, Logan Ritchie, Suhaas Garre, Nick Heiner, Edwin Chen","We show that training AI agents on high-fidelity reinforcement learning environments produces capabilities that generalize beyond the training distribution. We introduce \corecraft{}, the first environment in \textsc{EnterpriseGym}, Surge AI's suite of agentic RL environments. \corecraft{} is a fully operational enterprise simulation of a customer support organization, comprising over 2,500 entities across 14 entity types with 23 unique tools, designed to measure whether AI agents can perform the multi-step, domain-specific work that real jobs demand. Frontier models such as GPT-5.2 and Claude Opus 4.6 solve fewer than 30\% of tasks when all expert-authored rubric criteria must be satisfied. Using this environment, we train GLM~4.6 with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and adaptive clipping. After a single epoch of training, the model improves from 25.37\% to 36.76\% task pass rate on held-out evaluation tasks. More importantly, these gains transfer to out-of-distribution benchmarks: +4.5\% on BFCL Parallel, +7.4\% on $τ^2$-Bench Retail, and +6.8\% on Toolathlon (Pass@1). We believe three environment properties are consistent with the observed transfer: task-centric world building that optimizes for diverse, challenging tasks; expert-authored rubrics enabling reliable reward computation; and enterprise workflows that reflect realistic professional patterns. Our results suggest that environment quality, diversity, and realism are key factors enabling generalizable agent capabilities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16179v1,,False
HiPER: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Credit Assignment for Large Language Model Agents,18/02/2026,"Jiangweizhi Peng, Yuanxin Liu, Ruida Zhou, Charles Fleming, Zhaoran Wang, Alfredo Garcia, Mingyi Hong","Training LLMs as interactive agents for multi-turn decision-making remains challenging, particularly in long-horizon tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, where agents must execute extended sequences of actions before receiving meaningful feedback. Most existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches model LLM agents as flat policies operating at a single time scale, selecting one action at each turn. In sparse-reward settings, such flat policies must propagate credit across the entire trajectory without explicit temporal abstraction, which often leads to unstable optimization and inefficient credit assignment.
  We propose HiPER, a novel Hierarchical Plan-Execute RL framework that explicitly separates high-level planning from low-level execution. HiPER factorizes the policy into a high-level planner that proposes subgoals and a low-level executor that carries them out over multiple action steps. To align optimization with this structure, we introduce a key technique called hierarchical advantage estimation (HAE), which carefully assigns credit at both the planning and execution levels. By aggregating returns over the execution of each subgoal and coordinating updates across the two levels, HAE provides an unbiased gradient estimator and provably reduces variance compared to flat generalized advantage estimation.
  Empirically, HiPER achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging interactive benchmarks, reaching 97.4\% success on ALFWorld and 83.3\% on WebShop with Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct (+6.6\% and +8.3\% over the best prior method), with especially large gains on long-horizon tasks requiring multiple dependent subtasks. These results highlight the importance of explicit hierarchical decomposition for scalable RL training of multi-turn LLM agents.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16165v1,,False
ASPEN: Spectral-Temporal Fusion for Cross-Subject Brain Decoding,18/02/2026,"Megan Lee, Seung Ha Hwang, Inhyeok Choi, Shreyas Darade, Mengchun Zhang, Kateryna Shapovalenko","Cross-subject generalization in EEG-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) remains challenging due to individual variability in neural signals. We investigate whether spectral representations offer more stable features for cross-subject transfer than temporal waveforms. Through correlation analyses across three EEG paradigms (SSVEP, P300, and Motor Imagery), we find that spectral features exhibit consistently higher cross-subject similarity than temporal signals. Motivated by this observation, we introduce ASPEN, a hybrid architecture that combines spectral and temporal feature streams via multiplicative fusion, requiring cross-modal agreement for features to propagate. Experiments across six benchmark datasets reveal that ASPEN is able to dynamically achieve the optimal spectral-temporal balance depending on the paradigm. ASPEN achieves the best unseen-subject accuracy on three of six datasets and competitive performance on others, demonstrating that multiplicative multimodal fusion enables effective cross-subject generalization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16147v1,,False
Axle Sensor Fusion for Online Continual Wheel Fault Detection in Wayside Railway Monitoring,18/02/2026,"Afonso Lourenço, Francisca Osório, Diogo Risca, Goreti Marreiros","Reliable and cost-effective maintenance is essential for railway safety, particularly at the wheel-rail interface, which is prone to wear and failure. Predictive maintenance frameworks increasingly leverage sensor-generated time-series data, yet traditional methods require manual feature engineering, and deep learning models often degrade in online settings with evolving operational patterns. This work presents a semantic-aware, label-efficient continual learning framework for railway fault diagnostics. Accelerometer signals are encoded via a Variational AutoEncoder into latent representations capturing the normal operational structure in a fully unsupervised manner. Importantly, semantic metadata, including axle counts, wheel indexes, and strain-based deformations, is extracted via AI-driven peak detection on fiber Bragg grating sensors (resistant to electromagnetic interference) and fused with the VAE embeddings, enhancing anomaly detection under unknown operational conditions. A lightweight gradient boosting supervised classifier stabilizes anomaly scoring with minimal labels, while a replay-based continual learning strategy enables adaptation to evolving domains without catastrophic forgetting. Experiments show the model detects minor imperfections due to flats and polygonization, while adapting to evolving operational conditions, such as changes in train type, speed, load, and track profiles, captured using a single accelerometer and strain gauge in wayside monitoring.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2602.16101v1,,False
