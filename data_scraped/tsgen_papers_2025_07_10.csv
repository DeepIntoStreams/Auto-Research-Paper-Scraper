How to Bridge the Sim-to-Real Gap in Digital Twin-Aided Telecommunication Networks,09/07/2025,"Clement Ruah, Houssem Sifaou, Osvaldo Simeone, Bashir M. Al-Hashimi","Training effective artificial intelligence models for telecommunications is
challenging due to the scarcity of deployment-specific data. Real data
collection is expensive, and available datasets often fail to capture the
unique operational conditions and contextual variability of the network
environment. Digital twinning provides a potential solution to this problem, as
simulators tailored to the current network deployment can generate
site-specific data to augment the available training datasets. However, there
is a need to develop solutions to bridge the inherent simulation-to-reality
(sim-to-real) gap between synthetic and real-world data. This paper reviews
recent advances on two complementary strategies: 1) the calibration of digital
twins (DTs) through real-world measurements, and 2) the use of sim-to-real
gap-aware training strategies to robustly handle residual discrepancies between
digital twin-generated and real data. For the latter, we evaluate two
conceptually distinct methods that model the sim-to-real gap either at the
level of the environment via Bayesian learning or at the level of the training
loss via prediction-powered inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07067v1,,False
Surrogate Model for Heat Transfer Prediction in Impinging Jet Arrays using Dynamic Inlet/Outlet and Flow Rate Control,09/07/2025,"Mikael Vaillant, Victor Oliveira Ferreira, Wiebke Mainville, Jean-Michel Lamarre, Vincent Raymond, Moncef Chioua, Bruno Blais","This study presents a surrogate model designed to predict the Nusselt number
distribution in an enclosed impinging jet arrays, where each jet function
independently and where jets can be transformed from inlets to outlets, leading
to a vast number of possible flow arrangements. While computational fluid
dynamics (CFD) simulations can model heat transfer with high fidelity, their
cost prohibits real-time application such as model-based temperature control.
To address this, we generate a CNN-based surrogate model that can predict the
Nusselt distribution in real time. We train it with data from implicit large
eddy computational fluid dynamics simulations (Re < 2,000). We train two
distinct models, one for a five by one array of jets (83 simulations) and one
for a three by three array of jets (100 simulations). We introduce a method to
extrapolate predictions to higher Reynolds numbers (Re < 10,000) using a
correlation-based scaling. The surrogate models achieve high accuracy, with a
normalized mean average error below 2% on validation data for the five by one
surrogate model and 0.6% for the three by three surrogate model. Experimental
validation confirms the model's predictive capabilities. This work provides a
foundation for model-based control strategies in advanced thermal management
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07034v1,,False
Generating Multi-Table Time Series EHR from Latent Space with Minimal Preprocessing,09/07/2025,"Eunbyeol Cho, Jiyoun Kim, Minjae Lee, Sungjin Park, Edward Choi","Electronic Health Records (EHR) are time-series relational databases that
record patient interactions and medical events over time, serving as a critical
resource for healthcare research and applications. However, privacy concerns
and regulatory restrictions limit the sharing and utilization of such sensitive
data, necessitating the generation of synthetic EHR datasets. Unlike previous
EHR synthesis methods, which typically generate medical records consisting of
expert-chosen features (e.g. a few vital signs or structured codes only), we
introduce RawMed, the first framework to synthesize multi-table, time-series
EHR data that closely resembles raw EHRs. Using text-based representation and
compression techniques, RawMed captures complex structures and temporal
dynamics with minimal preprocessing. We also propose a new evaluation framework
for multi-table time-series synthetic EHRs, assessing distributional
similarity, inter-table relationships, temporal dynamics, and privacy.
Validated on two open-source EHR datasets, RawMed outperforms baseline models
in fidelity and utility. The code is available at
https://github.com/eunbyeol-cho/RawMed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06996v1,,False
What Has a Foundation Model Found? Using Inductive Bias to Probe for World Models,09/07/2025,"Keyon Vafa, Peter G. Chang, Ashesh Rambachan, Sendhil Mullainathan","Foundation models are premised on the idea that sequence prediction can
uncover deeper domain understanding, much like how Kepler's predictions of
planetary motion later led to the discovery of Newtonian mechanics. However,
evaluating whether these models truly capture deeper structure remains a
challenge. We develop a technique for evaluating foundation models that
examines how they adapt to synthetic datasets generated from some postulated
world model. Our technique measures whether the foundation model's inductive
bias aligns with the world model, and so we refer to it as an inductive bias
probe. Across multiple domains, we find that foundation models can excel at
their training tasks yet fail to develop inductive biases towards the
underlying world model when adapted to new tasks. We particularly find that
foundation models trained on orbital trajectories consistently fail to apply
Newtonian mechanics when adapted to new physics tasks. Further analysis reveals
that these models behave as if they develop task-specific heuristics that fail
to generalize.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06952v1,,False
Distribution-free inference for LightGBM and GLM with Tweedie loss,09/07/2025,"Alokesh Manna, Aditya Vikram Sett, Dipak K. Dey, Yuwen Gu, Elizabeth D. Schifano, Jichao He","Prediction uncertainty quantification is a key research topic in recent years
scientific and business problems. In insurance industries
(\cite{parodi2023pricing}), assessing the range of possible claim costs for
individual drivers improves premium pricing accuracy. It also enables insurers
to manage risk more effectively by accounting for uncertainty in accident
likelihood and severity. In the presence of covariates, a variety of
regression-type models are often used for modeling insurance claims, ranging
from relatively simple generalized linear models (GLMs) to regularized GLMs to
gradient boosting models (GBMs). Conformal predictive inference has arisen as a
popular distribution-free approach for quantifying predictive uncertainty under
relatively weak assumptions of exchangeability, and has been well studied under
the classic linear regression setting. In this work, we propose new
non-conformity measures for GLMs and GBMs with GLM-type loss. Using regularized
Tweedie GLM regression and LightGBM with Tweedie loss, we demonstrate conformal
prediction performance with these non-conformity measures in insurance claims
data. Our simulation results favor the use of locally weighted Pearson
residuals for LightGBM over other methods considered, as the resulting
intervals maintained the nominal coverage with the smallest average width.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06921v1,,False
Speckle2Self: Self-Supervised Ultrasound Speckle Reduction Without Clean Data,09/07/2025,"Xuesong Li, Nassir Navab, Zhongliang Jiang","Image denoising is a fundamental task in computer vision, particularly in
medical ultrasound (US) imaging, where speckle noise significantly degrades
image quality. Although recent advancements in deep neural networks have led to
substantial improvements in denoising for natural images, these methods cannot
be directly applied to US speckle noise, as it is not purely random. Instead,
US speckle arises from complex wave interference within the body
microstructure, making it tissue-dependent. This dependency means that
obtaining two independent noisy observations of the same scene, as required by
pioneering Noise2Noise, is not feasible. Additionally, blind-spot networks also
cannot handle US speckle noise due to its high spatial dependency. To address
this challenge, we introduce Speckle2Self, a novel self-supervised algorithm
for speckle reduction using only single noisy observations. The key insight is
that applying a multi-scale perturbation (MSP) operation introduces
tissue-dependent variations in the speckle pattern across different scales,
while preserving the shared anatomical structure. This enables effective
speckle suppression by modeling the clean image as a low-rank signal and
isolating the sparse noise component. To demonstrate its effectiveness,
Speckle2Self is comprehensively compared with conventional filter-based
denoising algorithms and SOTA learning-based methods, using both realistic
simulated US images and human carotid US images. Additionally, data from
multiple US machines are employed to evaluate model generalization and
adaptability to images from unseen domains. \textit{Code and datasets will be
released upon acceptance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06828v1,,False
Designing Robust Software Sensors for Nonlinear Systems via Neural Networks and Adaptive Sliding Mode Control,09/07/2025,"Ayoub Farkane, Mohamed Boutayeb, Mustapha Oudani, Mounir Ghogho","Accurate knowledge of the state variables in a dynamical system is critical
for effective control, diagnosis, and supervision, especially when direct
measurements of all states are infeasible. This paper presents a novel approach
to designing software sensors for nonlinear dynamical systems expressed in
their most general form. Unlike traditional model-based observers that rely on
explicit transformations or linearization, the proposed framework integrates
neural networks with adaptive Sliding Mode Control (SMC) to design a robust
state observer under a less restrictive set of conditions. The learning process
is driven by available sensor measurements, which are used to correct the
observer's state estimate. The training methodology leverages the system's
governing equations as a physics-based constraint, enabling observer synthesis
without access to ground-truth state trajectories. By employing a time-varying
gain matrix dynamically adjusted by the neural network, the observer adapts in
real-time to system changes, ensuring robustness against noise, external
disturbances, and variations in system dynamics. Furthermore, we provide
sufficient conditions to guarantee estimation error convergence, establishing a
theoretical foundation for the observer's reliability. The methodology's
effectiveness is validated through simulations on challenging examples,
including systems with non-differentiable dynamics and varying observability
conditions. These examples, which are often problematic for conventional
techniques, serve to demonstrate the robustness and broad applicability of our
approach. The results show rapid convergence and high accuracy, underscoring
the method's potential for addressing complex state estimation challenges in
real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06817v1,,False
Mathematical artificial data for operator learning,09/07/2025,"Heng Wu, Benzhuo Lu","Machine learning has emerged as a transformative tool for solving
differential equations (DEs), yet prevailing methodologies remain constrained
by dual limitations: data-driven methods demand costly labeled datasets while
model-driven techniques face efficiency-accuracy trade-offs. We present the
Mathematical Artificial Data (MAD) framework, a new paradigm that integrates
physical laws with data-driven learning to facilitate large-scale operator
discovery. By exploiting DEs' intrinsic mathematical structure to generate
physics-embedded analytical solutions and associated synthetic data, MAD
fundamentally eliminates dependence on experimental or simulated training data.
This enables computationally efficient operator learning across multi-parameter
systems while maintaining mathematical rigor. Through numerical demonstrations
spanning 2D parametric problems where both the boundary values and source term
are functions, we showcase MAD's generalizability and superior
efficiency/accuracy across various DE scenarios. This
physics-embedded-data-driven framework and its capacity to handle complex
parameter spaces gives it the potential to become a universal paradigm for
physics-informed machine intelligence in scientific computing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06752v1,,False
Exploring State-Space-Model based Language Model in Music Generation,09/07/2025,"Wei-Jaw Lee, Fang-Chih Hsieh, Xuanjun Chen, Fang-Duo Tsai, Yi-Hsuan Yang","The recent surge in State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the emergence of
Mamba, has established them as strong alternatives or complementary modules to
Transformers across diverse domains. In this work, we aim to explore the
potential of Mamba-based architectures for text-to-music generation. We adopt
discrete tokens of Residual Vector Quantization (RVQ) as the modeling
representation and empirically find that a single-layer codebook can capture
semantic information in music. Motivated by this observation, we focus on
modeling a single-codebook representation and adapt SiMBA, originally designed
as a Mamba-based encoder, to function as a decoder for sequence modeling. We
compare its performance against a standard Transformer-based decoder. Our
results suggest that, under limited-resource settings, SiMBA achieves much
faster convergence and generates outputs closer to the ground truth. This
demonstrates the promise of SSMs for efficient and expressive text-to-music
generation. We put audio examples on Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06674v1,,False
Q-STAC: Q-Guided Stein Variational Model Predictive Actor-Critic,09/07/2025,"Shizhe Cai, Jayadeep Jacob, Zeya Yin, Fabio Ramos","Deep reinforcement learning has shown remarkable success in continuous
control tasks, yet often requires extensive training data, struggles with
complex, long-horizon planning, and fails to maintain safety constraints during
operation. Meanwhile, Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers explainability and
constraint satisfaction, but typically yields only locally optimal solutions
and demands careful cost function design. This paper introduces the Q-guided
STein variational model predictive Actor-Critic (Q-STAC), a novel framework
that bridges these approaches by integrating Bayesian MPC with actor-critic
reinforcement learning through constrained Stein Variational Gradient Descent
(SVGD). Our method optimizes control sequences directly using learned Q-values
as objectives, eliminating the need for explicit cost function design while
leveraging known system dynamics to enhance sample efficiency and ensure
control signals remain within safe boundaries. Extensive experiments on 2D
navigation and robotic manipulation tasks demonstrate that Q-STAC achieves
superior sample efficiency, robustness, and optimality compared to
state-of-the-art algorithms, while maintaining the high expressiveness of
policy distributions. Experiment videos are available on our website:

Decoder-Hybrid-Decoder Architecture for Efficient Reasoning with Long Generation,09/07/2025,"Liliang Ren, Congcong Chen, Haoran Xu, Young Jin Kim, Adam Atkinson, Zheng Zhan, Jiankai Sun, Baolin Peng, Liyuan Liu, Shuohang Wang, Hao Cheng, Jianfeng Gao, Weizhu Chen, Yelong Shen","Recent advances in language modeling have demonstrated the effectiveness of
State Space Models (SSMs) for efficient sequence modeling. While hybrid
architectures such as Samba and the decoder-decoder architecture, YOCO, have
shown promising performance gains over Transformers, prior works have not
investigated the efficiency potential of representation sharing between SSM
layers. In this paper, we introduce the Gated Memory Unit (GMU), a simple yet
effective mechanism for efficient memory sharing across layers. We apply it to
create SambaY, a decoder-hybrid-decoder architecture that incorporates GMUs in
the cross-decoder to share memory readout states from a Samba-based
self-decoder. SambaY significantly enhances decoding efficiency, preserves
linear pre-filling time complexity, and boosts long-context performance, all
while eliminating the need for explicit positional encoding. Through extensive
scaling experiments, we demonstrate that our model exhibits a significantly
lower irreducible loss compared to a strong YOCO baseline, indicating superior
performance scalability under large-scale compute regimes. Our largest model
enhanced with Differential Attention, Phi4-mini-Flash-Reasoning, achieves
significantly better performance than Phi4-mini-Reasoning on reasoning tasks
such as Math500, AIME24/25, and GPQA Diamond without any reinforcement
learning, while delivering up to 10x higher decoding throughput on 2K-length
prompts with 32K generation length under the vLLM inference framework. We

SlimCaching: Edge Caching of Mixture-of-Experts for Distributed Inference,09/07/2025,"Qian Chen, Xianhao Chen, Kaibin Huang","Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models improve the scalability of large language
models (LLMs) by activating only a small subset of relevant experts per input.
However, the sheer number of expert networks in an MoE model introduces a
significant storage burden for an edge device. To address this challenge, we
consider a scenario where experts are dispersed within an edge network for
distributed inference. Based on the popular Top-$K$ expert selection strategy,
we formulate a latency minimization problem by optimizing expert caching on
edge servers under storage constraints. When $K=1$, the problem reduces to a
monotone submodular maximization problem with knapsack constraints, for which
we design a greedy-based algorithm with a $(1 - 1/e)$-approximation guarantee.
For the general case where $K\geq1$, expert co-activation within the same MoE
layer introduces non-submodularity, causing greedy methods to be ineffective.
To tackle this issue, we propose a successive greedy decomposition method to
decompose the original problem into a series of subproblems, with each being
solved by a dynamic programming approach. Furthermore, we design an accelerated
algorithm based on the max-convolution technique to obtain the approximate
solution with a provable guarantee in polynomial time. Simulation results on
various MoE models demonstrate that our method significantly reduces inference
latency compared to existing baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06567v1,,False
Direct Regret Optimization in Bayesian Optimization,09/07/2025,"Fengxue Zhang, Yuxin Chen","Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful paradigm for optimizing expensive
black-box functions. Traditional BO methods typically rely on separate
hand-crafted acquisition functions and surrogate models for the underlying
function, and often operate in a myopic manner. In this paper, we propose a
novel direct regret optimization approach that jointly learns the optimal model
and non-myopic acquisition by distilling from a set of candidate models and
acquisitions, and explicitly targets minimizing the multi-step regret. Our
framework leverages an ensemble of Gaussian Processes (GPs) with varying
hyperparameters to generate simulated BO trajectories, each guided by an
acquisition function chosen from a pool of conventional choices, until a
Bayesian early stop criterion is met. These simulated trajectories, capturing
multi-step exploration strategies, are used to train an end-to-end decision
transformer that directly learns to select next query points aimed at improving
the ultimate objective. We further adopt a dense training--sparse learning
paradigm: The decision transformer is trained offline with abundant simulated
data sampled from ensemble GPs and acquisitions, while a limited number of real
evaluations refine the GPs online. Experimental results on synthetic and
real-world benchmarks suggest that our method consistently outperforms BO
baselines, achieving lower simple regret and demonstrating more robust
exploration in high-dimensional or noisy settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06529v1,,False
Gradientsys: A Multi-Agent LLM Scheduler with ReAct Orchestration,09/07/2025,"Xinyuan Song, Zeyu Wang, Siyi Wu, Tianyu Shi, Lynn Ai","We present Gradientsys, a next-generation multi-agent scheduling framework
that coordinates diverse specialized AI agents using a typed Model-Context
Protocol (MCP) and a ReAct-based dynamic planning loop. At its core,
Gradientsys employs an LLM-powered scheduler for intelligent one-to-many task
dispatch, enabling parallel execution of heterogeneous agents such as PDF
parsers, web search modules, GUI controllers, and web builders. The framework
supports hybrid synchronous/asynchronous execution, respects agent capacity
constraints, and incorporates a robust retry-and-replan mechanism to handle
failures gracefully. To promote transparency and trust, Gradientsys includes an
observability layer streaming real-time agent activity and intermediate
reasoning via Server-Sent Events (SSE). We offer an architectural overview and
evaluate Gradientsys against existing frameworks in terms of extensibility,
scheduling topology, tool reusability, parallelism, and observability.
Experiments on the GAIA general-assistant benchmark show that Gradientsys
achieves higher task success rates with reduced latency and lower API costs
compared to a MinionS-style baseline, demonstrating the strength of its
LLM-driven multi-agent orchestration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06520v1,,False
Towards LLM-based Root Cause Analysis of Hardware Design Failures,09/07/2025,"Siyu Qiu, Muzhi Wang, Raheel Afsharmazayejani, Mohammad Moradi Shahmiri, Benjamin Tan, Hammond Pearce","With advances in large language models (LLMs), new opportunities have emerged
to develop tools that support the digital hardware design process. In this
work, we explore how LLMs can assist with explaining the root cause of design
issues and bugs that are revealed during synthesis and simulation, a necessary
milestone on the pathway towards widespread use of LLMs in the hardware design
process and for hardware security analysis. We find promising results: for our
corpus of 34 different buggy scenarios, OpenAI's o3-mini reasoning model
reached a correct determination 100% of the time under pass@5 scoring, with
other state of the art models and configurations usually achieving more than
80% performance and more than 90% when assisted with retrieval-augmented

GR-LLMs: Recent Advances in Generative Recommendation Based on Large Language Models,09/07/2025,"Zhen Yang, Haitao Lin, Jiawei xue, Ziji Zhang","In the past year, Generative Recommendations (GRs) have undergone substantial
advancements, especially in leveraging the powerful sequence modeling and
reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance overall
recommendation performance. LLM-based GRs are forming a new paradigm that is
distinctly different from discriminative recommendations, showing strong
potential to replace traditional recommendation systems heavily dependent on
complex hand-crafted features. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey
aimed at facilitating further research of LLM-based GRs. Initially, we outline
the general preliminaries and application cases of LLM-based GRs. Subsequently,
we introduce the main considerations when LLM-based GRs are applied in real
industrial scenarios. Finally, we explore promising directions for LLM-based
GRs. We hope that this survey contributes to the ongoing advancement of the GR

Foundation Model Self-Play: Open-Ended Strategy Innovation via Foundation Models,09/07/2025,"Aaron Dharna, Cong Lu, Jeff Clune","Multi-agent interactions have long fueled innovation, from natural
predator-prey dynamics to the space race. Self-play (SP) algorithms try to
harness these dynamics by pitting agents against ever-improving opponents,
thereby creating an implicit curriculum toward learning high-quality solutions.
However, SP often fails to produce diverse solutions and can get stuck in
locally optimal behaviors. We introduce Foundation-Model Self-Play (FMSP), a
new direction that leverages the code-generation capabilities and vast
knowledge of foundation models (FMs) to overcome these challenges by leaping
across local optima in policy space. We propose a family of approaches: (1)
\textbf{Vanilla Foundation-Model Self-Play (vFMSP)} continually refines agent
policies via competitive self-play; (2) \textbf{Novelty-Search Self-Play
(NSSP)} builds a diverse population of strategies, ignoring performance; and
(3) the most promising variant, \textbf{Quality-Diveristy Self-Play (QDSP)},
creates a diverse set of high-quality policies by combining the diversity of
NSSP and refinement of vFMSP. We evaluate FMSPs in Car Tag, a
continuous-control pursuer-evader setting, and in Gandalf, a simple AI safety
simulation in which an attacker tries to jailbreak an LLM's defenses. In Car
Tag, FMSPs explore a wide variety of reinforcement learning, tree search, and
heuristic-based methods, to name just a few. In terms of discovered policy
quality, \ouralgo and vFMSP surpass strong human-designed strategies. In
Gandalf, FMSPs can successfully automatically red-team an LLM, breaking through
and jailbreaking six different, progressively stronger levels of defense.
Furthermore, FMSPs can automatically proceed to patch the discovered
vulnerabilities. Overall, FMSPs represent a promising new research frontier of
improving self-play with foundation models, opening fresh paths toward more
creative and open-ended strategy discovery",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06466v1,,False
