Designing Cyclic Peptides via Harmonic SDE with Atom-Bond Modeling,27/05/2025,"Xiangxin Zhou, Mingyu Li, Yi Xiao, Jiahan Li, Dongyu Xue, Zaixiang Zheng, Jianzhu Ma, Quanquan Gu","Cyclic peptides offer inherent advantages in pharmaceuticals. For example,
cyclic peptides are more resistant to enzymatic hydrolysis compared to linear
peptides and usually exhibit excellent stability and affinity. Although deep
generative models have achieved great success in linear peptide design, several
challenges prevent the development of computational methods for designing
diverse types of cyclic peptides. These challenges include the scarcity of 3D
structural data on target proteins and associated cyclic peptide ligands, the
geometric constraints that cyclization imposes, and the involvement of
non-canonical amino acids in cyclization. To address the above challenges, we
introduce CpSDE, which consists of two key components: AtomSDE, a generative
structure prediction model based on harmonic SDE, and ResRouter, a residue type
predictor. Utilizing a routed sampling algorithm that alternates between these
two models to iteratively update sequences and structures, CpSDE facilitates
the generation of cyclic peptides. By employing explicit all-atom and bond
modeling, CpSDE overcomes existing data limitations and is proficient in
designing a wide variety of cyclic peptides. Our experimental results
demonstrate that the cyclic peptides designed by our method exhibit reliable
stability and affinity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21452v1,,False
Learning Individual Behavior in Agent-Based Models with Graph Diffusion Networks,27/05/2025,"Francesco Cozzi, Marco Pangallo, Alan Perotti, André Panisson, Corrado Monti","Agent-Based Models (ABMs) are powerful tools for studying emergent properties
in complex systems. In ABMs, agent behaviors are governed by local interactions
and stochastic rules. However, these rules are, in general, non-differentiable,
limiting the use of gradient-based methods for optimization, and thus
integration with real-world data. We propose a novel framework to learn a
differentiable surrogate of any ABM by observing its generated data. Our method
combines diffusion models to capture behavioral stochasticity and graph neural
networks to model agent interactions. Distinct from prior surrogate approaches,
our method introduces a fundamental shift: rather than approximating
system-level outputs, it models individual agent behavior directly, preserving
the decentralized, bottom-up dynamics that define ABMs. We validate our
approach on two ABMs (Schelling's segregation model and a Predator-Prey
ecosystem) showing that it replicates individual-level patterns and accurately
forecasts emergent dynamics beyond training. Our results demonstrate the
potential of combining diffusion models and graph learning for data-driven ABM
simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21426v1,,False
A Convergence Theory for Diffusion Language Models: An Information-Theoretic Perspective,27/05/2025,"Gen Li, Changxiao Cai","Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modern generative
modeling, demonstrating strong potential for large language models (LLMs).
Unlike conventional autoregressive (AR) models that generate tokens
sequentially, diffusion models enable parallel token sampling, leading to
faster generation and eliminating left-to-right generation constraints. Despite
their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of diffusion model
approaches remains underdeveloped. In this work, we develop convergence
guarantees for diffusion language models from an information-theoretic
perspective. Our analysis demonstrates that the sampling error, measured by the
Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, decays inversely with the number of
iterations $T$ and scales linearly with the mutual information between tokens
in the target text sequence. In particular, we establish matching upper and
lower bounds, up to some constant factor, to demonstrate the tightness of our
convergence analysis. These results offer novel theoretical insights into the
practical effectiveness of diffusion language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21400v1,,False
"Factual Self-Awareness in Language Models: Representation, Robustness, and Scaling",27/05/2025,"Hovhannes Tamoyan, Subhabrata Dutta, Iryna Gurevych","Factual incorrectness in generated content is one of the primary concerns in
ubiquitous deployment of large language models (LLMs). Prior findings suggest
LLMs can (sometimes) detect factual incorrectness in their generated content
(i.e., fact-checking post-generation). In this work, we provide evidence
supporting the presence of LLMs' internal compass that dictate the correctness
of factual recall at the time of generation. We demonstrate that for a given
subject entity and a relation, LLMs internally encode linear features in the
Transformer's residual stream that dictate whether it will be able to recall
the correct attribute (that forms a valid entity-relation-attribute triplet).
This self-awareness signal is robust to minor formatting variations. We
investigate the effects of context perturbation via different example selection
strategies. Scaling experiments across model sizes and training dynamics
highlight that self-awareness emerges rapidly during training and peaks in
intermediate layers. These findings uncover intrinsic self-monitoring
capabilities within LLMs, contributing to their interpretability and
reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21399v1,,False
AgriFM: A Multi-source Temporal Remote Sensing Foundation Model for Crop Mapping,27/05/2025,"Wenyuan Li, Shunlin Liang, Keyan Chen, Yongzhe Chen, Han Ma, Jianglei Xu, Yichuan Ma, Shikang Guan, Husheng Fang, Zhenwei Shi","Accurate crop mapping fundamentally relies on modeling multi-scale
spatiotemporal patterns, where spatial scales range from individual field
textures to landscape-level context, and temporal scales capture both
short-term phenological transitions and full growing-season dynamics.
Transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer promising
potential for crop mapping due to their innate ability for unified
spatiotemporal processing. However, current RSFMs remain suboptimal for crop
mapping: they either employ fixed spatiotemporal windows that ignore the
multi-scale nature of crop systems or completely disregard temporal information
by focusing solely on spatial patterns. To bridge these gaps, we present
AgriFM, a multi-source remote sensing foundation model specifically designed
for agricultural crop mapping. Our approach begins by establishing the
necessity of simultaneous hierarchical spatiotemporal feature extraction,
leading to the development of a modified Video Swin Transformer architecture
where temporal down-sampling is synchronized with spatial scaling operations.
This modified backbone enables efficient unified processing of long time-series
satellite inputs. AgriFM leverages temporally rich data streams from three
satellite sources including MODIS, Landsat-8/9 and Sentinel-2, and is
pre-trained on a global representative dataset comprising over 25 million image
samples supervised by land cover products. The resulting framework incorporates
a versatile decoder architecture that dynamically fuses these learned
spatiotemporal representations, supporting diverse downstream tasks.
Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate AgriFM's superior performance over
conventional deep learning approaches and state-of-the-art general-purpose
RSFMs across all downstream tasks. Codes will be available at

Scheduling with Uncertain Holding Costs and its Application to Content Moderation,27/05/2025,"Caner Gocmen, Thodoris Lykouris, Deeksha Sinha, Wentao Weng","In content moderation for social media platforms, the cost of delaying the
review of a content is proportional to its view trajectory, which fluctuates
and is apriori unknown. Motivated by such uncertain holding costs, we consider
a queueing model where job states evolve based on a Markov chain with
state-dependent instantaneous holding costs. We demonstrate that in the
presence of such uncertain holding costs, the two canonical algorithmic
principles, instantaneous-cost ($c\mu$-rule) and expected-remaining-cost
($c\mu/\theta$-rule), are suboptimal. By viewing each job as a Markovian
ski-rental problem, we develop a new index-based algorithm,
Opportunity-adjusted Remaining Cost (OaRC), that adjusts to the opportunity of
serving jobs in the future when uncertainty partly resolves. We show that the
regret of OaRC scales as $\tilde{O}(L^{1.5}\sqrt{N})$, where $L$ is the maximum
length of a job's holding cost trajectory and $N$ is the system size. This
regret bound shows that OaRC achieves asymptotic optimality when the system
size $N$ scales to infinity. Moreover, its regret is independent of the
state-space size, which is a desirable property when job states contain
contextual information. We corroborate our results with an extensive simulation
study based on two holding cost patterns (online ads and user-generated
content) that arise in content moderation for social media platforms. Our
simulations based on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that OaRC
consistently outperforms existing practice, which is based on the two canonical
algorithmic principles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21331v1,,False
UGCE: User-Guided Incremental Counterfactual Exploration,27/05/2025,"Christos Fragkathoulas, Evaggelia Pitoura","Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) are a popular approach for interpreting
machine learning predictions by identifying minimal feature changes that alter
model outputs. However, in real-world settings, users often refine feasibility
constraints over time, requiring counterfactual generation to adapt
dynamically. Existing methods fail to support such iterative updates, instead
recomputing explanations from scratch with each change, an inefficient and
rigid approach. We propose User-Guided Incremental Counterfactual Exploration
(UGCE), a genetic algorithm-based framework that incrementally updates
counterfactuals in response to evolving user constraints. Experimental results
across five benchmark datasets demonstrate that UGCE significantly improves
computational efficiency while maintaining high-quality solutions compared to a
static, non-incremental approach. Our evaluation further shows that UGCE
supports stable performance under varying constraint sequences, benefits from
an efficient warm-start strategy, and reveals how different constraint types
may affect search behavior.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21330v1,,False
Assured Autonomy with Neuro-Symbolic Perception,27/05/2025,"R. Spencer Hallyburton, Miroslav Pajic","Many state-of-the-art AI models deployed in cyber-physical systems (CPS),
while highly accurate, are simply pattern-matchers.~With limited security
guarantees, there are concerns for their reliability in safety-critical and
contested domains. To advance assured AI, we advocate for a paradigm shift that
imbues data-driven perception models with symbolic structure, inspired by a
human's ability to reason over low-level features and high-level context. We
propose a neuro-symbolic paradigm for perception (NeuSPaPer) and illustrate how
joint object detection and scene graph generation (SGG) yields deep scene

and specialized SGG algorithms for real-time deployment, we design a framework
leveraging structured relational graphs that ensures the integrity of

Wavelet Flow For Extragalactic Foreground Simulations,27/05/2025,"M. Mebratu, W. L. K. Wu","Extragalactic foregrounds in cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations
are both a source of cosmological and astrophysical information and a nuisance
to the CMB. Effective field-level modeling that captures their non-Gaussian
statistical distributions is increasingly important for optimal information
extraction, particularly given the precise and low-noise observations from
current and upcoming experiments. We explore the use of Wavelet Flow (WF)
models to tackle the novel task of modeling the field-level probability
distributions of multi-component CMB secondaries. Specifically, we jointly
train correlated CMB lensing convergence ($\kappa$) and cosmic infrared
background (CIB) maps with a WF model and obtain a network that statistically
recovers the input to high accuracy -- the trained network generates samples of
$\kappa$ and CIB fields whose average power spectra are within a few percent of
the inputs across all scales, and whose Minkowski functionals are similarly
accurate compared to the inputs. Leveraging the multiscale architecture of
these models, we fine-tune both the model parameters and the priors at each
scale independently, optimizing performance across different resolutions. These
results demonstrate that WF models can accurately simulate correlated
components of CMB secondaries, supporting improved analysis of cosmological
data. Our code and trained models can be found here

Quantum AIXI: Universal Intelligence via Quantum Information,27/05/2025,Elija Perrier,"AIXI is a widely studied model of artificial general intelligence (AGI) based
upon principles of induction and reinforcement learning. However, AIXI is
fundamentally classical in nature - as are the environments in which it is
modelled. Given the universe is quantum mechanical in nature and the
exponential overhead required to simulate quantum mechanical systems
classically, the question arises as to whether there are quantum mechanical
analogues of AIXI which are theoretically consistent or practically feasible as
models of universal intelligence. To address this question, we extend the
framework to quantum information and present Quantum AIXI (QAIXI). We introduce
a model of quantum agent/environment interaction based upon quantum and
classical registers and channels, showing how quantum AIXI agents may take both
classical and quantum actions. We formulate the key components of AIXI in
quantum information terms, extending previous research on quantum Kolmogorov
complexity and a QAIXI value function. We discuss conditions and limitations
upon quantum Solomonoff induction and show how contextuality fundamentally
affects QAIXI models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21170v1,,False
STEB: In Search of the Best Evaluation Approach for Synthetic Time Series,27/05/2025,"Michael Stenger, Robert Leppich, André Bauer, Samuel Kounev","The growing need for synthetic time series, due to data augmentation or

evaluation measures alike. Objectively comparing these measures on a large
scale remains an open challenge. We propose the Synthetic Time series
Evaluation Benchmark (STEB) -- the first benchmark framework that enables
comprehensive and interpretable automated comparisons of synthetic time series
evaluation measures. Using 10 diverse datasets, randomness injection, and 13
configurable data transformations, STEB computes indicators for measure
reliability and score consistency. It tracks running time, test errors, and
features sequential and parallel modes of operation. In our experiments, we

GGBond: Growing Graph-Based AI-Agent Society for Socially-Aware Recommender Simulation,27/05/2025,"Hailin Zhong, Hanlin Wang, Yujun Ye, Meiyi Zhang, Shengxin Zhu","Current personalized recommender systems predominantly rely on static offline
data for algorithm design and evaluation, significantly limiting their ability
to capture long-term user preference evolution and social influence dynamics in
real-world scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, we propose a
high-fidelity social simulation platform integrating human-like cognitive
agents and dynamic social interactions to realistically simulate user behavior
evolution under recommendation interventions. Specifically, the system
comprises a population of Sim-User Agents, each equipped with a five-layer
cognitive architecture that encapsulates key psychological mechanisms,
including episodic memory, affective state transitions, adaptive preference
learning, and dynamic trust-risk assessments. In particular, we innovatively
introduce the Intimacy--Curiosity--Reciprocity--Risk (ICR2) motivational engine
grounded in psychological and sociological theories, enabling more realistic
user decision-making processes. Furthermore, we construct a multilayer
heterogeneous social graph (GGBond Graph) supporting dynamic relational
evolution, effectively modeling users' evolving social ties and trust dynamics
based on interest similarity, personality alignment, and structural homophily.
During system operation, agents autonomously respond to recommendations
generated by typical recommender algorithms (e.g., Matrix Factorization,
MultVAE, LightGCN), deciding whether to consume, rate, and share content while
dynamically updating their internal states and social connections, thereby
forming a stable, multi-round feedback loop. This innovative design transcends
the limitations of traditional static datasets, providing a controlled,
observable environment for evaluating long-term recommender effects.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21154v1,,False
SageAttention2++: A More Efficient Implementation of SageAttention2,27/05/2025,"Jintao Zhang, Xiaoming Xu, Jia Wei, Haofeng Huang, Pengle Zhang, Chendong Xiang, Jun Zhu, Jianfei Chen","The efficiency of attention is critical because its time complexity grows

A domain adaptation neural network for digital twin-supported fault diagnosis,27/05/2025,"Zhenling Chen, Haiwei Fu, Zhiguo Zeng","Digital twins offer a promising solution to the lack of sufficient labeled
data in deep learning-based fault diagnosis by generating simulated data for
model training. However, discrepancies between simulation and real-world
systems can lead to a significant drop in performance when models are applied
in real scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a fault diagnosis
framework based on Domain-Adversarial Neural Networks (DANN), which enables
knowledge transfer from simulated (source domain) to real-world (target domain)
data. We evaluate the proposed framework using a publicly available robotics
fault diagnosis dataset, which includes 3,600 sequences generated by a digital

method is compared with commonly used lightweight deep learning models such as
CNN, TCN, Transformer, and LSTM. Experimental results show that incorporating
domain adaptation significantly improves the diagnostic performance. For

Cardiac Digital Twins at Scale from MRI: Open Tools and Representative Models from ~55000 UK Biobank Participants,27/05/2025,"Devran Ugurlu, Shuang Qian, Elliot Fairweather, Charlene Mauger, Bram Ruijsink, Laura Dal Toso, Yu Deng, Marina Strocchi, Reza Razavi, Alistair Young, Pablo Lamata, Steven Niederer, Martin Bishop","A cardiac digital twin is a virtual replica of a patient's heart for

Identifying Super Spreaders in Multilayer Networks,27/05/2025,"Michał Czuba, Mateusz Stolarski, Adam Piróg, Piotr Bielak, Piotr Bródka","Identifying super-spreaders can be framed as a subtask of the influence
maximisation problem. It seeks to pinpoint agents within a network that, if
selected as single diffusion seeds, disseminate information most effectively.
Multilayer networks, a specific class of heterogeneous graphs, can capture
diverse types of interactions (e.g., physical-virtual or professional-social),
and thus offer a more accurate representation of complex relational structures.
In this work, we introduce a novel approach to identifying super-spreaders in
such networks by leveraging graph neural networks. To this end, we construct a
dataset by simulating information diffusion across hundreds of networks - to
the best of our knowledge, the first of its kind tailored specifically to
multilayer networks. We further formulate the task as a variation of the
ranking prediction problem based on a four-dimensional vector that quantifies
each agent's spreading potential: (i) the number of activations; (ii) the
duration of the diffusion process; (iii) the peak number of activations; and
(iv) the simulation step at which this peak occurs. Our model,
TopSpreadersNetwork, comprises a relationship-agnostic encoder and a custom
aggregation layer. This design enables generalisation to previously unseen data
and adapts to varying graph sizes. In an extensive evaluation, we compare our
model against classic centrality-based heuristics and competitive deep learning
methods. The results, obtained across a broad spectrum of real-world and
synthetic multilayer networks, demonstrate that TopSpreadersNetwork achieves
superior performance in identifying high-impact nodes, while also offering
improved interpretability through its structured output.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20980v1,,False
Unified Deep Learning Approach for Estimating the Metallicities of RR Lyrae Stars Using light curves from Gaia Data Release 3,27/05/2025,"Lorenzo Monti, Tatiana Muraveva, Alessia Garofalo, Gisella Clementini, Maria Letizia Valentini","RR Lyrae stars (RRLs) are old pulsating variables widely used as metallicity
tracers due to the correlation between their metal abundances and light curve
morphology. With ESA Gaia DR3 providing light curves for about 270,000 RRLs,
there is a pressing need for scalable methods to estimate their metallicities
from photometric data. We introduce a unified deep learning framework that
estimates metallicities for both fundamental-mode (RRab) and first-overtone
(RRc) RRLs using Gaia G-band light curves. This approach extends our previous
work on RRab stars to include RRc stars, aiming for high predictive accuracy
and broad generalization across both pulsation types. The model is based on a
Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural network optimized for time-series extrinsic
regression. Our pipeline includes preprocessing steps such as phase folding,
smoothing, and sample weighting, and uses photometric metallicities from the
literature as training targets. The architecture is designed to handle
morphological differences between RRab and RRc light curves without requiring
separate models. On held-out validation sets, our GRU model achieves strong
performance: for RRab stars, MAE = 0.0565 dex, RMSE = 0.0765 dex, R^2 = 0.9401;
for RRc stars, MAE = 0.0505 dex, RMSE = 0.0720 dex, R^2 = 0.9625. These results

HAD: Hybrid Architecture Distillation Outperforms Teacher in Genomic Sequence Modeling,27/05/2025,"Hexiong Yang, Mingrui Chen, Huaibo Huang, Junxian Duan, Jie Cao, Zhen Zhou, Ran He","Inspired by the great success of Masked Language Modeling (MLM) in the
natural language domain, the paradigm of self-supervised pre-training and

"Leaner Transformers: More Heads, Less Depth",27/05/2025,"Hemanth Saratchandran, Damien Teney, Simon Lucey","Transformers have reshaped machine learning by utilizing attention mechanisms
to capture complex patterns in large datasets, leading to significant
improvements in performance. This success has contributed to the belief that

improving the conditioning of the attention block. We exploit this theoretical
insight and redesign popular architectures with an increased number of heads.
The improvement in the conditioning proves so significant in practice that

TimePro: Efficient Multivariate Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Variable- and Time-Aware Hyper-state,27/05/2025,"Xiaowen Ma, Zhenliang Ni, Shuai Xiao, Xinghao Chen","In long-term time series forecasting, different variables often influence the

Robust and Explainable Detector of Time Series Anomaly via Augmenting Multiclass Pseudo-Anomalies,27/05/2025,"Kohei Obata, Yasuko Matsubara, Yasushi Sakurai","Unsupervised anomaly detection in time series has been a pivotal research
area for decades. Current mainstream approaches focus on learning normality, on
the assumption that all or most of the samples in the training set are normal.
However, anomalies in the training set (i.e., anomaly contamination) can be
misleading. Recent studies employ data augmentation to generate
pseudo-anomalies and learn the boundary separating the training samples from
the augmented samples. Although this approach mitigates anomaly contamination
if augmented samples mimic unseen real anomalies, it suffers from several
limitations. (1) Covering a wide range of time series anomalies is challenging.
(2) It disregards augmented samples that resemble normal samples (i.e., false
anomalies). (3) It places too much trust in the labels of training and
augmented samples. In response, we propose RedLamp, which employs diverse data
augmentations to generate multiclass pseudo-anomalies and learns the multiclass
boundary. Such multiclass pseudo-anomalies cover a wide variety of time series
anomalies. We conduct multiclass classification using soft labels, which
prevents the model from being overconfident and ensures its robustness against
contaminated/false anomalies. The learned latent space is inherently
explainable as it is trained to separate pseudo-anomalies into multiclasses.

Semi-supervised Clustering Through Representation Learning of Large-scale EHR Data,27/05/2025,"Linshanshan Wang, Mengyan Li, Zongqi Xia, Molei Liu, Tianxi Cai","Electronic Health Records (EHR) offer rich real-world data for personalized
medicine, providing insights into disease progression, treatment responses, and
patient outcomes. However, their sparsity, heterogeneity, and high
dimensionality make them difficult to model, while the lack of standardized
ground truth further complicates predictive modeling. To address these
challenges, we propose SCORE, a semi-supervised representation learning
framework that captures multi-domain disease profiles through patient
embeddings. SCORE employs a Poisson-Adapted Latent factor Mixture (PALM) Model
with pre-trained code embeddings to characterize codified features and extract
meaningful patient phenotypes and embeddings. To handle the computational
challenges of large-scale data, it introduces a hybrid Expectation-Maximization
(EM) and Gaussian Variational Approximation (GVA) algorithm, leveraging limited
labeled data to refine estimates on a vast pool of unlabeled samples. We
theoretically establish the convergence of this hybrid approach, quantify GVA
errors, and derive SCORE's error rate under diverging embedding dimensions. Our
analysis shows that incorporating unlabeled data enhances accuracy and reduces
sensitivity to label scarcity. Extensive simulations confirm SCORE's superior
finite-sample performance over existing methods. Finally, we apply SCORE to

LeDiFlow: Learned Distribution-guided Flow Matching to Accelerate Image Generation,27/05/2025,"Pascal Zwick, Nils Friederich, Maximilian Beichter, Lennart Hilbert, Ralf Mikut, Oliver Bringmann","Enhancing the efficiency of high-quality image generation using Diffusion
Models (DMs) is a significant challenge due to the iterative nature of the
process. Flow Matching (FM) is emerging as a powerful generative modeling
paradigm based on a simulation-free training objective instead of a score-based
one used in DMs. Typical FM approaches rely on a Gaussian distribution prior,
which induces curved, conditional probability paths between the prior and
target data distribution. These curved paths pose a challenge for the Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE) solver, requiring a large number of inference calls
to the flow prediction network. To address this issue, we present Learned
Distribution-guided Flow Matching (LeDiFlow), a novel scalable method for
training FM-based image generation models using a better-suited prior
distribution learned via a regression-based auxiliary model. By initializing
the ODE solver with a prior closer to the target data distribution, LeDiFlow
enables the learning of more computationally tractable probability paths. These
paths directly translate to fewer solver steps needed for high-quality image
generation at inference time. Our method utilizes a State-Of-The-Art (SOTA)
transformer architecture combined with latent space sampling and can be trained
on a consumer workstation. We empirically demonstrate that LeDiFlow remarkably
outperforms the respective FM baselines. For instance, when operating directly
on pixels, our model accelerates inference by up to 3.75x compared to the

Recurrent Neural Operators (RNOs)-a novel framework that integrates recurrent
training into neural operator architectures. Instead of conditioning each
training step on ground-truth inputs, RNOs recursively apply the operator to
their own predictions over a temporal window, effectively simulating
inference-time dynamics during training. This alignment mitigates exposure bias
and enhances robustness to error accumulation. Theoretically, we show that
recurrent training can reduce the worst-case exponential error growth typical
of teacher forcing to linear growth. Empirically, we demonstrate that
recurrently trained Multigrid Neural Operators significantly outperform their
teacher-forced counterparts in long-term accuracy and stability on standard
benchmarks. Our results underscore the importance of aligning training with
inference dynamics for robust temporal generalization in neural operator
learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20721v1,,False
Sparsified State-Space Models are Efficient Highway Networks,27/05/2025,"Woomin Song, Jihoon Tack, Sangwoo Mo, Seunghyuk Oh, Jinwoo Shin","State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising architecture for sequence
modeling, providing an alternative to Transformers by replacing expensive
self-attention with linear recurrences. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
effective trick to enhance SSMs within given computational budgets by
sparsifying them. Our intuition is that tokens in SSMs are highly redundant due
to gradual recurrent updates, and dense recurrence operations block the
delivery of past information. In particular, we observe that upper layers of
SSMs tend to be more redundant as they encode global information, while lower
layers encode local information. Motivated by this, we introduce Simba, a
hierarchical sparsification method for SSMs based on token pruning. Simba
sparsifies upper layers more than lower layers, encouraging the upper layers to
behave like highways. To achieve this, we propose a novel token pruning
criterion for SSMs, measuring the global impact of tokens on the final output
by accumulating local recurrences. We demonstrate that Simba outperforms the
baseline model, Mamba, with the same FLOPS in various natural language tasks.
Moreover, we illustrate the effect of highways, showing that Simba not only
enhances efficiency but also improves the information flow across long
sequences. Code is available at https://github.com/woominsong/Simba.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20698v1,,False
Generating Hypotheses of Dynamic Causal Graphs in Neuroscience: Leveraging Generative Factor Models of Observed Time Series,27/05/2025,"Zachary C. Brown, David Carlson","The field of hypothesis generation promises to reduce costs in neuroscience
by narrowing the range of interventional studies needed to study various
phenomena. Existing machine learning methods can generate scientific hypotheses
from complex datasets, but many approaches assume causal relationships are
static over time, limiting their applicability to systems with dynamic,
state-dependent behavior, such as the brain. While some techniques attempt
dynamic causal discovery through factor models, they often restrict
relationships to linear patterns or impose other simplifying assumptions. We
propose a novel method that models dynamic graphs as a conditionally weighted
superposition of static graphs, where each static graph can capture nonlinear
relationships. This approach enables the detection of complex, time-varying
interactions between variables beyond linear limitations. Our method improves
f1-scores of predicted dynamic causal patterns by roughly 22-28% on average
over baselines in some of our experiments, with some improvements reaching well
over 60%. A case study on real brain data demonstrates our method's ability to
uncover relationships linked to specific behavioral states, offering valuable
insights into neural dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20697v1,,False
Comparisons between a Large Language Model-based Real-Time Compound Diagnostic Medical AI Interface and Physicians for Common Internal Medicine Cases using Simulated Patients,27/05/2025,"Hyungjun Park, Chang-Yun Woo, Seungjo Lim, Seunghwan Lim, Keunho Kwak, Ju Young Jeong, Chong Hyun Suh","Objective To develop an LLM based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI
interface and performed a clinical trial comparing this interface and
physicians for common internal medicine cases based on the United States
Medical License Exam (USMLE) Step 2 Clinical Skill (CS) style exams. Methods A
nonrandomized clinical trial was conducted on August 20, 2024. We recruited one
general physician, two internal medicine residents (2nd and 3rd year), and five
simulated patients. The clinical vignettes were adapted from the USMLE Step 2
CS style exams. We developed 10 representative internal medicine cases based on
actual patients and included information available on initial diagnostic
evaluation. Primary outcome was the accuracy of the first differential
diagnosis. Repeatability was evaluated based on the proportion of agreement.
Results The accuracy of the physicians' first differential diagnosis ranged
from 50% to 70%, whereas the realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface
achieved an accuracy of 80%. The proportion of agreement for the first
differential diagnosis was 0.7. The accuracy of the first and second
differential diagnoses ranged from 70% to 90% for physicians, whereas the AI
interface achieved an accuracy rate of 100%. The average time for the AI
interface (557 sec) was 44.6% shorter than that of the physicians (1006 sec).
The AI interface ($0.08) also reduced costs by 98.1% compared to the
physicians' average ($4.2). Patient satisfaction scores ranged from 4.2 to 4.3
for care by physicians and were 3.9 for the AI interface Conclusion An LLM
based realtime compound diagnostic medical AI interface demonstrated diagnostic
accuracy and patient satisfaction comparable to those of a physician, while
requiring less time and lower costs. These findings suggest that AI interfaces
may have the potential to assist primary care consultations for common internal
medicine cases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.20609v1,,False
