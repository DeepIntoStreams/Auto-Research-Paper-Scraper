CoRe-Net: Co-Operational Regressor Network with Progressive Transfer Learning for Blind Radar Signal Restoration,28/01/2025,"Muhammad Uzair Zahid, Serkan Kiranyaz, Alper Yildirim, Moncef Gabbouj","Real-world radar signals are frequently corrupted by various artifacts,
including sensor noise, echoes, interference, and intentional jamming,
differing in type, severity, and duration. This pilot study introduces a novel
model, called Co-Operational Regressor Network (CoRe-Net) for blind radar
signal restoration, designed to address such limitations and drawbacks.
CoRe-Net replaces adversarial training with a novel cooperative learning
strategy, leveraging the complementary roles of its Apprentice Regressor (AR)
and Master Regressor (MR). The AR restores radar signals corrupted by various
artifacts, while the MR evaluates the quality of the restoration and provides
immediate and task-specific feedback, ensuring stable and efficient learning.
The AR, therefore, has the advantage of both self-learning and assistive
learning by the MR. The proposed model has been extensively evaluated over the
benchmark Blind Radar Signal Restoration (BRSR) dataset, which simulates
diverse real-world artifact scenarios. Under the fair experimental setup, this
study shows that the CoRe-Net surpasses the Op-GANs over a 1 dB mean SNR
improvement. To further boost the performance gain, this study proposes
multi-pass restoration by cascaded CoRe-Nets trained with a novel paradigm
called Progressive Transfer Learning (PTL), which enables iterative refinement,
thus achieving an additional 2 dB mean SNR enhancement. Multi-pass CoRe-Net
training by PTL consistently yields incremental performance improvements
through successive restoration passes whilst highlighting CoRe-Net ability to
handle such a complex and varying blend of artifacts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17125v1,,False
Mamba-Shedder: Post-Transformer Compression for Efficient Selective Structured State Space Models,28/01/2025,"J. Pablo Muñoz, Jinjie Yuan, Nilesh Jain","Large pre-trained models have achieved outstanding results in sequence
modeling. The Transformer block and its attention mechanism have been the main
drivers of the success of these models. Recently, alternative architectures,
such as Selective Structured State Space Models (SSMs), have been proposed to
address the inefficiencies of Transformers. This paper explores the compression
of SSM-based models, particularly Mamba and its hybrids. We study the
sensitivity of these models to the removal of selected components at different
granularities to reduce the model size and computational overhead, thus
improving their efficiency while maintaining accuracy. The proposed solutions,
collectively referred to as Mamba-Shedder, achieve a speedup of up to 1.4x
during inference, demonstrating that model efficiency can be improved by
eliminating several redundancies with minimal impact on the overall model
performance. The code is available at

Graph Transformers for inverse physics: reconstructing flows around arbitrary 2D airfoils,28/01/2025,"Gregory Duthé, Imad Abdallah, Eleni Chatzi","We introduce a Graph Transformer framework that serves as a general inverse
physics engine on meshes, demonstrated through the challenging task of
reconstructing aerodynamic flow fields from sparse surface measurements. While
deep learning has shown promising results in forward physics simulation,
inverse problems remain particularly challenging due to their ill-posed nature
and the difficulty of propagating information from limited boundary
observations. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining the
geometric expressiveness of message-passing neural networks with the global
reasoning of Transformers, enabling efficient learning of inverse mappings from
boundary conditions to complete states. We evaluate this framework on a
comprehensive dataset of steady-state RANS simulations around diverse airfoil
geometries, where the task is to reconstruct full pressure and velocity fields
from surface pressure measurements alone. The architecture achieves high
reconstruction accuracy while maintaining fast inference times. We conduct
experiments and provide insights into the relative importance of local
geometric processing and global attention mechanisms in mesh-based inverse
problems. We also find that the framework is robust to reduced sensor coverage.
These results suggest that Graph Transformers can serve as effective inverse
physics engines across a broader range of applications where complete system
states must be reconstructed from limited boundary observations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17081v1,,False
Synthesizing 3D Abstractions by Inverting Procedural Buildings with Transformers,28/01/2025,"Max Dax, Jordi Berbel, Jan Stria, Leonidas Guibas, Urs Bergmann","We generate abstractions of buildings, reflecting the essential aspects of
their geometry and structure, by learning to invert procedural models. We first
build a dataset of abstract procedural building models paired with simulated
point clouds and then learn the inverse mapping through a transformer. Given a
point cloud, the trained transformer then infers the corresponding abstracted
building in terms of a programmatic language description. This approach
leverages expressive procedural models developed for gaming and animation, and
thereby retains desirable properties such as efficient rendering of the
inferred abstractions and strong priors for regularity and symmetry. Our
approach achieves good reconstruction accuracy in terms of geometry and
structure, as well as structurally consistent inpainting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17044v1,,False
Benchmarking Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Signal Classification in Simulated Gamma-Ray Burst Detection,28/01/2025,"Farida Farsian, Nicolò Parmiggiani, Alessandro Rizzo, Gabriele Panebianco, Andrea Bulgarelli, Francesco Schillirò, Carlo Burigana, Vincenzo Cardone, Luca Cappelli, Massimo Meneghetti, Giuseppe Murante, Giuseppe Sarracino, Roberto Scaramella, Vincenzo Testa, Tiziana Trombetti","This study evaluates the use of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs)
for identifying signals resembling Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) within simulated
astrophysical datasets in the form of light curves. The task addressed here
focuses on distinguishing GRB-like signals from background noise in simulated
Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) data, the next-generation
astrophysical observatory for very high-energy gamma-ray science. QCNNs, a
quantum counterpart of classical Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), leverage
quantum principles to process and analyze high-dimensional data efficiently. We
implemented a hybrid quantum-classical machine learning technique using the
Qiskit framework, with the QCNNs trained on a quantum simulator. Several QCNN
architectures were tested, employing different encoding methods such as Data
Reuploading and Amplitude encoding. Key findings include that QCNNs achieved
accuracy comparable to classical CNNs, often surpassing 90\%, while using fewer
parameters, potentially leading to more efficient models in terms of
computational resources. A benchmark study further examined how hyperparameters
like the number of qubits and encoding methods affected performance, with more
qubits and advanced encoding methods generally enhancing accuracy but
increasing complexity. QCNNs showed robust performance on time-series datasets,
successfully detecting GRB signals with high precision. The research is a
pioneering effort in applying QCNNs to astrophysics, offering insights into
their potential and limitations. This work sets the stage for future
investigations to fully realize the advantages of QCNNs in astrophysical data
analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17041v1,,False
Revisit Mixture Models for Multi-Agent Simulation: Experimental Study within a Unified Framework,28/01/2025,"Longzhong Lin, Xuewu Lin, Kechun Xu, Haojian Lu, Lichao Huang, Rong Xiong, Yue Wang","Simulation plays a crucial role in assessing autonomous driving systems,
where the generation of realistic multi-agent behaviors is a key aspect. In
multi-agent simulation, the primary challenges include behavioral multimodality
and closed-loop distributional shifts. In this study, we revisit mixture models
for generating multimodal agent behaviors, which can cover the mainstream
methods including continuous mixture models and GPT-like discrete models.
Furthermore, we introduce a closed-loop sample generation approach tailored for
mixture models to mitigate distributional shifts. Within the unified mixture
model~(UniMM) framework, we recognize critical configurations from both model
and data perspectives. We conduct a systematic examination of various model
configurations, including positive component matching, continuous regression,
prediction horizon, and the number of components. Moreover, our investigation
into the data configuration highlights the pivotal role of closed-loop samples
in achieving realistic simulations. To extend the benefits of closed-loop
samples across a broader range of mixture models, we further address the
shortcut learning and off-policy learning issues. Leveraging insights from our
exploration, the distinct variants proposed within the UniMM framework,
including discrete, anchor-free, and anchor-based models, all achieve
state-of-the-art performance on the WOSAC benchmark.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17015v1,,False
MIDI-GPT: A Controllable Generative Model for Computer-Assisted Multitrack Music Composition,28/01/2025,"Philippe Pasquier, Jeff Ens, Nathan Fradet, Paul Triana, Davide Rizzotti, Jean-Baptiste Rolland, Maryam Safi","We present and release MIDI-GPT, a generative system based on the Transformer
architecture that is designed for computer-assisted music composition
workflows. MIDI-GPT supports the infilling of musical material at the track and
bar level, and can condition generation on attributes including: instrument
type, musical style, note density, polyphony level, and note duration. In order
to integrate these features, we employ an alternative representation for
musical material, creating a time-ordered sequence of musical events for each
track and concatenating several tracks into a single sequence, rather than
using a single time-ordered sequence where the musical events corresponding to
different tracks are interleaved. We also propose a variation of our
representation allowing for expressiveness. We present experimental results
that demonstrate that MIDI-GPT is able to consistently avoid duplicating the
musical material it was trained on, generate music that is stylistically
similar to the training dataset, and that attribute controls allow enforcing
various constraints on the generated material. We also outline several
real-world applications of MIDI-GPT, including collaborations with industry
partners that explore the integration and evaluation of MIDI-GPT into
commercial products, as well as several artistic works produced using it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.17011v1,,False
MAUCell: An Adaptive Multi-Attention Framework for Video Frame Prediction,28/01/2025,"Shreyam Gupta, P. Agrawal, Priyam Gupta","Temporal sequence modeling stands as the fundamental foundation for video
prediction systems and real-time forecasting operations as well as anomaly
detection applications. The achievement of accurate predictions through
efficient resource consumption remains an ongoing issue in contemporary
temporal sequence modeling. We introduce the Multi-Attention Unit (MAUCell)
which combines Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and spatio-temporal
attention mechanisms to improve video frame prediction capabilities. Our
approach implements three types of attention models to capture intricate motion
sequences. A dynamic combination of these attention outputs allows the model to
reach both advanced decision accuracy along with superior quality while
remaining computationally efficient. The integration of GAN elements makes
generated frames appear more true to life therefore the framework creates
output sequences which mimic real-world footage. The new design system
maintains equilibrium between temporal continuity and spatial accuracy to
deliver reliable video prediction. Through a comprehensive evaluation
methodology which merged the perceptual LPIPS measurement together with classic
tests MSE, MAE, SSIM and PSNR exhibited enhancing capabilities than
contemporary approaches based on direct benchmark tests of Moving MNIST, KTH
Action, and CASIA-B (Preprocessed) datasets. Our examination indicates that
MAUCell shows promise for operational time requirements. The research findings
demonstrate how GANs work best with attention mechanisms to create better
applications for predicting video sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16997v1,,False
Online-BLS: An Accurate and Efficient Online Broad Learning System for Data Stream Classification,28/01/2025,"Chunyu Lei, Guang-Ze Chen, C. L. Philip Chen, Tong Zhang","The state-of-the-art online learning models generally conduct a single online
gradient descent when a new sample arrives and thus suffer from suboptimal
model weights. To this end, we introduce an online broad learning system
framework with closed-form solutions for each online update. Different from
employing existing incremental broad learning algorithms for online learning
tasks, which tend to incur degraded accuracy and expensive online update
overhead, we design an effective weight estimation algorithm and an efficient
online updating strategy to remedy the above two deficiencies, respectively.
Specifically, an effective weight estimation algorithm is first developed by
replacing notorious matrix inverse operations with Cholesky decomposition and
forward-backward substitution to improve model accuracy. Second, we devise an
efficient online updating strategy that dramatically reduces online update
time. Theoretical analysis exhibits the splendid error bound and low time
complexity of our model. The most popular test-then-training evaluation
experiments on various real-world datasets prove its superiority and
efficiency. Furthermore, our framework is naturally extended to data stream
scenarios with concept drift and exceeds state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16932v1,,False
Extending Information Bottleneck Attribution to Video Sequences,28/01/2025,"Veronika Solopova, Lucas Schmidt, Dorothea Kolossa","We introduce VIBA, a novel approach for explainable video classification by
adapting Information Bottlenecks for Attribution (IBA) to video sequences.
While most traditional explainability methods are designed for image models,
our IBA framework addresses the need for explainability in temporal models used
for video analysis. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply VIBA to video
deepfake detection, testing it on two architectures: the Xception model for
spatial features and a VGG11-based model for capturing motion dynamics through
optical flow. Using a custom dataset that reflects recent deepfake generation
techniques, we adapt IBA to create relevance and optical flow maps, visually
highlighting manipulated regions and motion inconsistencies. Our results show
that VIBA generates temporally and spatially consistent explanations, which
align closely with human annotations, thus providing interpretability for video
classification and particularly for deepfake detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16889v1,,False
Optimization and Learning in Open Multi-Agent Systems,28/01/2025,"Diego Deplano, Nicola Bastianello, Mauro Franceschelli, Karl H. Johansson","Modern artificial intelligence relies on networks of agents that collect
data, process information, and exchange it with neighbors to collaboratively
solve optimization and learning problems. This article introduces a novel
distributed algorithm to address a broad class of these problems in ""open
networks"", where the number of participating agents may vary due to several
factors, such as autonomous decisions, heterogeneous resource availability, or
DoS attacks. Extending the current literature, the convergence analysis of the
proposed algorithm is based on the newly developed ""Theory of Open Operators"",
which characterizes an operator as open when the set of components to be
updated changes over time, yielding to time-varying operators acting on
sequences of points of different dimensions and compositions. The mathematical
tools and convergence results developed here provide a general framework for
evaluating distributed algorithms in open networks, allowing to characterize
their performance in terms of the punctual distance from the optimal solution,
in contrast with regret-based metrics that assess cumulative performance over a
finite-time horizon. As illustrative examples, the proposed algorithm is used
to solve dynamic consensus or tracking problems on different metrics of
interest, such as average, median, and min/max value, as well as classification
problems with logistic loss functions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16847v1,,False
Exponential Family Attention,28/01/2025,"Kevin Christian Wibisono, Yixin Wang","The self-attention mechanism is the backbone of the transformer neural
network underlying most large language models. It can capture complex word
patterns and long-range dependencies in natural language. This paper introduces
exponential family attention (EFA), a probabilistic generative model that
extends self-attention to handle high-dimensional sequence, spatial, or
spatial-temporal data of mixed data types, including both discrete and
continuous observations. The key idea of EFA is to model each observation
conditional on all other existing observations, called the context, whose
relevance is learned in a data-driven way via an attention-based latent factor
model. In particular, unlike static latent embeddings, EFA uses the
self-attention mechanism to capture dynamic interactions in the context, where
the relevance of each context observations depends on other observations. We
establish an identifiability result and provide a generalization guarantee on
excess loss for EFA. Across real-world and synthetic data sets -- including
U.S. city temperatures, Instacart shopping baskets, and MovieLens ratings -- we
find that EFA consistently outperforms existing models in capturing complex
latent structures and reconstructing held-out data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16790v1,,False
"FlexMotion: Lightweight, Physics-Aware, and Controllable Human Motion Generation",28/01/2025,"Arvin Tashakori, Arash Tashakori, Gongbo Yang, Z. Jane Wang, Peyman Servati","Lightweight, controllable, and physically plausible human motion synthesis is
crucial for animation, virtual reality, robotics, and human-computer
interaction applications. Existing methods often compromise between
computational efficiency, physical realism, or spatial controllability. We
propose FlexMotion, a novel framework that leverages a computationally
lightweight diffusion model operating in the latent space, eliminating the need
for physics simulators and enabling fast and efficient training. FlexMotion
employs a multimodal pre-trained Transformer encoder-decoder, integrating joint
locations, contact forces, joint actuations and muscle activations to ensure
the physical plausibility of the generated motions. FlexMotion also introduces
a plug-and-play module, which adds spatial controllability over a range of
motion parameters (e.g., joint locations, joint actuations, contact forces, and
muscle activations). Our framework achieves realistic motion generation with
improved efficiency and control, setting a new benchmark for human motion
synthesis. We evaluate FlexMotion on extended datasets and demonstrate its
superior performance in terms of realism, physical plausibility, and
controllability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16778v1,,False
Meta-Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Real-Time Traffic Flow Management,28/01/2025,"Bob Johnson, Michael Geller","Efficient management of traffic flow in urban environments presents a
significant challenge, exacerbated by dynamic changes and the sheer volume of
data generated by modern transportation networks. Traditional centralized
traffic management systems often struggle with scalability and privacy
concerns, hindering their effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach
by combining Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) to create a
decentralized, scalable, and adaptive traffic management system. Our approach,
termed Meta-Federated Learning, leverages the distributed nature of FL to
process data locally at the edge, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing
latency. Simultaneously, ML enables the system to quickly adapt to new traffic
conditions without the need for extensive retraining. We implement our model
across a simulated network of smart traffic devices, demonstrating that
Meta-Federated Learning significantly outperforms traditional models in terms
of prediction accuracy and response time. Furthermore, our approach shows
remarkable adaptability to sudden changes in traffic patterns, suggesting a
scalable solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities. This study
not only paves the way for more resilient urban traffic systems but also
exemplifies the potential of integrated FL and ML in other real-world
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16758v1,,False
Bridging Neural Networks and Wireless Systems with MIMO-OFDM Semantic Communications,28/01/2025,"Hanju Yoo, Dongha Choi, Yonghwi Kim, Yoontae Kim, Songkuk Kim, Chan-Byoung Chae, Robert W. Heath Jr","Semantic communications aim to enhance transmission efficiency by jointly
optimizing source coding, channel coding, and modulation. While prior research
has demonstrated promising performance in simulations, real-world
implementations often face significant challenges, including noise variability
and nonlinear distortions, leading to performance gaps. This article
investigates these challenges in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM)-based semantic communication
system, focusing on the practical impacts of power amplifier (PA) nonlinearity
and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) variations. Our analysis identifies
frequency selectivity of the actual channel as a critical factor in performance
degradation and demonstrates that targeted mitigation strategies can enable
semantic systems to approach theoretical performance. By addressing key

Variational Schrödinger Momentum Diffusion,28/01/2025,"Kevin Rojas, Yixin Tan, Molei Tao, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Wei Deng","The momentum Schr\""odinger Bridge (mSB) has emerged as a leading method for
accelerating generative diffusion processes and reducing transport costs.
However, the lack of simulation-free properties inevitably results in high
training costs and affects scalability. To obtain a trade-off between transport
properties and scalability, we introduce variational Schr\""odinger momentum
diffusion (VSMD), which employs linearized forward score functions (variational
scores) to eliminate the dependence on simulated forward trajectories. Our
approach leverages a multivariate diffusion process with adaptively
transport-optimized variational scores. Additionally, we apply a
critical-damping transform to stabilize training by removing the need for score
estimations for both velocity and samples. Theoretically, we prove the
convergence of samples generated with optimal variational scores and momentum
diffusion. Empirical results demonstrate that VSMD efficiently generates
anisotropic shapes while maintaining transport efficacy, outperforming
overdamped alternatives, and avoiding complex denoising processes. Our approach
also scales effectively to real-world data, achieving competitive results in
time series and image generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16675v1,,False
Applying Ensemble Models based on Graph Neural Network and Reinforcement Learning for Wind Power Forecasting,28/01/2025,"Hongjin Song, Qianrun Chen, Tianqi Jiang, Yongfeng Li, Xusheng Li, Wenjun Xi, Songtao Huang","Accurately predicting the wind power output of a wind farm across various

power trading and utilization. The WPF problem remains unresolved due to
numerous influencing variables, such as wind speed, temperature, latitude, and
