"Beyond One Shot, Beyond One Perspective: Cross-View and Long-Horizon Distillation for Better LiDAR Representations",07/07/2025,"Xiang Xu, Lingdong Kong, Song Wang, Chuanwei Zhou, Qingshan Liu","LiDAR representation learning aims to extract rich structural and semantic
information from large-scale, readily available datasets, reducing reliance on
costly human annotations. However, existing LiDAR representation strategies
often overlook the inherent spatiotemporal cues in LiDAR sequences, limiting
their effectiveness. In this work, we propose LiMA, a novel long-term
image-to-LiDAR Memory Aggregation framework that explicitly captures longer
range temporal correlations to enhance LiDAR representation learning. LiMA
comprises three key components: 1) a Cross-View Aggregation module that aligns
and fuses overlapping regions across neighboring camera views, constructing a
more unified and redundancy-free memory bank; 2) a Long-Term Feature
Propagation mechanism that efficiently aligns and integrates multi-frame image
features, reinforcing temporal coherence during LiDAR representation learning;
and 3) a Cross-Sequence Memory Alignment strategy that enforces consistency
across driving sequences, improving generalization to unseen environments. LiMA
maintains high pretraining efficiency and incurs no additional computational
overhead during downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on mainstream
LiDAR-based perception benchmarks demonstrate that LiMA significantly improves
both LiDAR semantic segmentation and 3D object detection. We hope this work
inspires more effective pretraining paradigms for autonomous driving. The code
has be made publicly accessible for future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05260v1,,False
Action Space Reduction Strategies for Reinforcement Learning in Autonomous Driving,07/07/2025,"Elahe Delavari, Feeza Khan Khanzada, Jaerock Kwon","Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising framework for autonomous
driving by enabling agents to learn control policies through interaction with
environments. However, large and high-dimensional action spaces often used to
support fine-grained control can impede training efficiency and increase
exploration costs. In this study, we introduce and evaluate two novel
structured action space modification strategies for RL in autonomous driving:
dynamic masking and relative action space reduction. These approaches are
systematically compared against fixed reduction schemes and full action space
baselines to assess their impact on policy learning and performance. Our
framework leverages a multimodal Proximal Policy Optimization agent that
processes both semantic image sequences and scalar vehicle states. The proposed
dynamic and relative strategies incorporate real-time action masking based on
context and state transitions, preserving action consistency while eliminating
invalid or suboptimal choices. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse
driving routes, we show that action space reduction significantly improves
training stability and policy performance. The dynamic and relative schemes, in
particular, achieve a favorable balance between learning speed, control
precision, and generalization. These findings highlight the importance of
context-aware action space design for scalable and reliable RL in autonomous
driving tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05251v1,,False
Cascade: Token-Sharded Private LLM Inference,07/07/2025,"Rahul Thomas, Louai Zahran, Erica Choi, Akilesh Potti, Micah Goldblum, Arka Pal","As LLMs continue to increase in parameter size, the computational resources
required to run them are available to fewer parties. Therefore, third-party
inference services -- where LLMs are hosted by third parties with significant
computational resources -- are becoming increasingly popular. However, third
party inference raises critical concerns about user data privacy. To mitigate
these risks, privacy researchers have developed provably secure schemes for
third-party inference, such as Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However,
SMPC protocols have significant computational and communication overhead, and
do not scale to large models. In this work, we propose a new multi-party
inference protocol, Cascade, that avoids these punitive costs by leveraging
sharding in the sequence dimension to maintain privacy, trading off
cryptographic privacy guarantees for increased performance and scalability. We
demonstrate that Cascade is resistant to a generalization of a recent attack
that is highly effective against other statistical privacy schemes, and that it
is further resistant to learning-based attacks. As Cascade is orders of
magnitude faster than existing schemes, our findings offer practical solutions
for secure deployment of modern state-of-the-art LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05228v1,,False
NavigScene: Bridging Local Perception and Global Navigation for Beyond-Visual-Range Autonomous Driving,07/07/2025,"Qucheng Peng, Chen Bai, Guoxiang Zhang, Bo Xu, Xiaotong Liu, Xiaoyin Zheng, Chen Chen, Cheng Lu","Autonomous driving systems have made significant advances in Q&A, perception,
prediction, and planning based on local visual information, yet they struggle
to incorporate broader navigational context that human drivers routinely
utilize. We address this critical gap between local sensor data and global
navigation information by proposing NavigScene, an auxiliary navigation-guided
natural language dataset that simulates a human-like driving environment within
autonomous driving systems. Moreover, we develop three complementary paradigms
to leverage NavigScene: (1) Navigation-guided Reasoning, which enhances
vision-language models by incorporating navigation context into the prompting
approach; (2) Navigation-guided Preference Optimization, a reinforcement
learning method that extends Direct Preference Optimization to improve
vision-language model responses by establishing preferences for
navigation-relevant summarized information; and (3) Navigation-guided
Vision-Language-Action model, which integrates navigation guidance and
vision-language models with conventional driving models through feature fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approaches significantly improve
performance across perception, prediction, planning, and question-answering
tasks by enabling reasoning capabilities beyond visual range and improving
generalization to diverse driving scenarios. This work represents a significant
step toward more comprehensive autonomous driving systems capable of navigating
complex, unfamiliar environments with greater reliability and safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05227v1,,False
A 3D Machine Learning based Volume Of Fluid scheme without explicit interface reconstruction,07/07/2025,"Moreno Pintore, Bruno Despr√©s","We present a machine-learning based Volume Of Fluid method to simulate
multi-material flows on three-dimensional domains. One of the novelties of the
method is that the flux fraction is computed by evaluating a previously trained
neural network and without explicitly reconstructing any local interface
approximating the exact one. The network is trained on a purely synthetic
dataset generated by randomly sampling numerous local interfaces and which can
be adapted to improve the scheme on less regular interfaces when needed.
Several strategies to ensure the efficiency of the method and the satisfaction
of physical constraints and properties are suggested and formalized. Numerical
results on the advection equation are provided to show the performance of the

EmbodieDreamer: Advancing Real2Sim2Real Transfer for Policy Training via Embodied World Modeling,07/07/2025,"Boyuan Wang, Xinpan Meng, Xiaofeng Wang, Zheng Zhu, Angen Ye, Yang Wang, Zhiqin Yang, Chaojun Ni, Guan Huang, Xingang Wang","The rapid advancement of Embodied AI has led to an increasing demand for
large-scale, high-quality real-world data. However, collecting such embodied
data remains costly and inefficient. As a result, simulation environments have
become a crucial surrogate for training robot policies. Yet, the significant
Real2Sim2Real gap remains a critical bottleneck, particularly in terms of
physical dynamics and visual appearance. To address this challenge, we propose
EmbodieDreamer, a novel framework that reduces the Real2Sim2Real gap from both
the physics and appearance perspectives. Specifically, we propose PhysAligner,
a differentiable physics module designed to reduce the Real2Sim physical gap.
It jointly optimizes robot-specific parameters such as control gains and
friction coefficients to better align simulated dynamics with real-world
observations. In addition, we introduce VisAligner, which incorporates a
conditional video diffusion model to bridge the Sim2Real appearance gap by
translating low-fidelity simulated renderings into photorealistic videos
conditioned on simulation states, enabling high-fidelity visual transfer.
Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of EmbodieDreamer. The
proposed PhysAligner reduces physical parameter estimation error by 3.74%
compared to simulated annealing methods while improving optimization speed by
89.91\%. Moreover, training robot policies in the generated photorealistic

CREW-WILDFIRE: Benchmarking Agentic Multi-Agent Collaborations at Scale,07/07/2025,"Jonathan Hyun, Nicholas R Waytowich, Boyuan Chen","Despite rapid progress in large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent
systems, current benchmarks fall short in evaluating their scalability,
robustness, and coordination capabilities in complex, dynamic, real-world
tasks. Existing environments typically focus on small-scale, fully observable,
or low-complexity domains, limiting their utility for developing and assessing
next-generation multi-agent Agentic AI frameworks. We introduce CREW-Wildfire,
an open-source benchmark designed to close this gap. Built atop the human-AI

critical need for transparent research into the LSLMs and empathetic behavior,
we present OpenS2S, a fully open-source, transparent and end-to-end LSLM

Critiques of World Models,07/07/2025,"Eric Xing, Mingkai Deng, Jinyu Hou, Zhiting Hu","World Model, the supposed algorithmic surrogate of the real-world environment
which biological agents experience with and act upon, has been an emerging
topic in recent years because of the rising needs to develop virtual agents
with artificial (general) intelligence. There has been much debate on what a
world model really is, how to build it, how to use it, and how to evaluate it.
In this essay, starting from the imagination in the famed Sci-Fi classic Dune,
and drawing inspiration from the concept of ""hypothetical thinking"" in
psychology literature, we offer critiques of several schools of thoughts on
world modeling, and argue the primary goal of a world model to be simulating
all actionable possibilities of the real world for purposeful reasoning and
acting. Building on the critiques, we propose a new architecture for a
general-purpose world model, based on hierarchical, multi-level, and mixed
continuous/discrete representations, and a generative and self-supervision

GIST: Cross-Domain Click-Through Rate Prediction via Guided Content-Behavior Distillation,07/07/2025,"Wei Xu, Haoran Li, Baoyuan Ou, Lai Xu, Yingjie Qin, Ruilong Su, Ruiwen Xu","Cross-domain Click-Through Rate prediction aims to tackle the data sparsity
and the cold start problems in online advertising systems by transferring
knowledge from source domains to a target domain. Most existing methods rely on
overlapping users to facilitate this transfer, often focusing on joint training
or pre-training with fine-tuning approach to connect the source and target
domains. However, in real-world industrial settings, joint training struggles
to learn optimal representations with different distributions, and pre-training
with fine-tuning is not well-suited for continuously integrating new data. To
address these issues, we propose GIST, a cross-domain lifelong sequence model
that decouples the training processes of the source and target domains. Unlike
previous methods that search lifelong sequences in the source domains using
only content or behavior signals or their simple combinations, we innovatively
introduce a Content-Behavior Joint Training Module (CBJT), which aligns
content-behavior distributions and combines them with guided information to
facilitate a more stable representation. Furthermore, we develop an Asymmetric
Similarity Integration strategy (ASI) to augment knowledge transfer through
similarity computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of

extraction and technology computer-aided design (TCAD) fitting. To facilitate
this task, we implement a simple data augmentation and pre-training approach by
training a secondary neural network to approximate a physics-based device
simulator. This method enables high-quality fits after training the neural

SMART: Simulated Students Aligned with Item Response Theory for Question Difficulty Prediction,07/07/2025,"Alexander Scarlatos, Nigel Fernandez, Christopher Ormerod, Susan Lottridge, Andrew Lan","Item (question) difficulties play a crucial role in educational assessments,
enabling accurate and efficient assessment of student abilities and
personalization to maximize learning outcomes. Traditionally, estimating item
difficulties can be costly, requiring real students to respond to items,
followed by fitting an item response theory (IRT) model to get item difficulty
estimates. This approach cannot be applied to the cold-start setting for
previously unseen items either. In this work, we present SMART (Simulated
Students Aligned with IRT), a novel method for aligning simulated students with
instructed ability, which can then be used in simulations to predict the
difficulty of open-ended items. We achieve this alignment using direct
preference optimization (DPO), where we form preference pairs based on how
likely responses are under a ground-truth IRT model. We perform a simulation by
generating thousands of responses, evaluating them with an LLM-based scoring
model, and fit the resulting data to an IRT model to obtain item difficulty
estimates. Through extensive experiments on a real-world student response

methods by leveraging its improved ability alignment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05129v1,,False
A Generative Diffusion Model for Amorphous Materials,07/07/2025,"Kai Yang, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda","Generative models show great promise for the inverse design of molecules and
inorganic crystals, but remain largely ineffective within more complex

datasets, and characterise when exactly the underlying dynamics admit a
reconstruction mapping from the history of previous tokenized frames to the
next. To validate these claims, we develop a sequence of models with increasing
complexity, starting with least-squares regression and progressing through
simple linear layers, shallow adversarial learners, and ultimately full-scale
generative adversarial networks (GANs). We evaluate these models on a variety
of datasets, including modified forms of the heat and wave equations, the

Fine-tuning on simulated data outperforms prompting for agent tone of voice,07/07/2025,"Ingo Marquardt, Philippe Brule","Deploying language models (LMs) in customer-facing speech applications
requires conversational fluency and adherence to specific stylistic guidelines.
This can be challenging to achieve reliably using complex system prompts due to
issues like instruction following limitations and in-context bias. This study
investigates the effectiveness of fine-tuning versus system prompting for
aligning LMs with a specific behavioral target: responding in a natural,
conversational tone suitable for voice interactions. We fine-tuned a small,
open-weights model (`Llama3.2-1B-Instruct`) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on
a synthetically generated dataset derived from Wikipedia. Additionally, we
fine-tuned two closed-source models (`gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-4.1-mini`). Our
results demonstrate that fine-tuning outperformed system prompting, achieving a
high percentage of conversational responses, even when trained on only 100 data
samples. Semantic similarity analysis confirmed that fine-tuning did not
degrade content quality. Interestingly, fine-tuning with 8-bit integer
quantization converged faster towards the target style than using bfloat16
precision, potentially due to implicit regularization effects. We conclude that
fine-tuning small, open-weights LMs on simulated data is a highly effective and

preferable alternative to complex system prompting for practical applications

A Novel Approach for Estimating Positive Lyapunov Exponents in One-Dimensional Chaotic Time Series Using Machine Learning,07/07/2025,"A. Velichko, M. Belyaev, P. Boriskov","Understanding and quantifying chaos in nonlinear dynamical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in science and engineering. The Lyapunov exponent is a
key measure of chaotic behavior, but its accurate estimation from experimental

work, we present a novel machine-learning-based approach for estimating the
positive Lyapunov exponent (MLE) from one-dimensional time series, using the
growth of out-of-sample prediction errors as a proxy for trajectory divergence.
Our method demonstrates high scientific relevance, offering a robust,

comprehensive testing on several canonical chaotic maps - including the
logistic, sine, cubic, and Chebyshev maps - we achieved a coefficient of

Activation Steering for Chain-of-Thought Compression,07/07/2025,"Seyedarmin Azizi, Erfan Baghaei Potraghloo, Massoud Pedram","Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning when they include
intermediate steps, known as ""chains of thought"" (CoTs). However, these
rationales are often overly verbose, even for simple problems, leading to
wasted context, increased latency, and higher energy consumption. We observe
that verbose, English-heavy CoTs and concise, math-centric CoTs occupy distinct
regions in the model's residual-stream activation space. By extracting and
injecting a ""steering vector"" to transition between these modes, we can
reliably shift generation toward more concise reasoning, effectively
compressing CoTs without retraining. We formalize this approach as
Activation-Steered Compression (ASC), an inference-time technique that shortens
reasoning traces by directly modifying hidden representations. In addition, we
provide a theoretical analysis of the impact of ASC on the output distribution,
derived from a closed-form KL-divergence-bounded constraint to regulate
steering strength. Using only 100 paired verbose and concise examples, ASC
achieves up to 67.43% reduction in CoT length on MATH500 and GSM8K datasets,

ChipSeek-R1: Generating Human-Surpassing RTL with LLM via Hierarchical Reward-Driven Reinforcement Learning,07/07/2025,"Zhirong Chen, Kaiyan Chang, Zhuolin Li, Xinyang He, Chujie Chen, Cangyuan Li, Mengdi Wang, Haobo Xu, Yinhe Han, Ying Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant potential for automating
Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. However, current approaches face
a critical challenge: they can not simultaneously optimize for functional
correctness and hardware quality (Power, Performance, Area - PPA). Methods

PPA-suboptimal code, lacking mechanisms to learn optimization principles. In
contrast, post-processing techniques that attempt to improve PPA metrics after
generation are often inefficient because they operate externally without
updating the LLM's parameters, thus failing to enhance the model's intrinsic
design capabilities.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce ChipSeek-R1, a hierarchical reward-driven

Hierarchical Intent-guided Optimization with Pluggable LLM-Driven Semantics for Session-based Recommendation,07/07/2025,"Jinpeng Chen, Jianxiang He, Huan Li, Senzhang Wang, Yuan Cao, Kaimin Wei, Zhenye Yang, Ye Ji","Session-based Recommendation (SBR) aims to predict the next item a user will
likely engage with, using their interaction sequence within an anonymous
session. Existing SBR models often focus only on single-session information,
ignoring inter-session relationships and valuable cross-session insights. Some
methods try to include inter-session data but struggle with noise and
irrelevant information, reducing performance. Additionally, most models rely on
item ID co-occurrence and overlook rich semantic details, limiting their
ability to capture fine-grained item features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel hierarchical intent-guided optimization approach with pluggable
LLM-driven semantic learning for session-based recommendations, called HIPHOP.
First, we introduce a pluggable embedding module based on large language models
(LLMs) to generate high-quality semantic representations, enhancing item
embeddings. Second, HIPHOP utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) to model item
transition relationships and incorporates a dynamic multi-intent capturing
module to address users' diverse interests within a session. Additionally, we
design a hierarchical inter-session similarity learning module, guided by user
intent, to capture global and local session relationships, effectively
exploring users' long-term and short-term interests. To mitigate noise, an
intent-guided denoising strategy is applied during inter-session learning.
Finally, we enhance the model's discriminative capability by using contrastive
learning to optimize session representations. Experiments on multiple datasets
show that HIPHOP significantly outperforms existing methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in improving recommendation quality. Our code is available:

DisMS-TS: Eliminating Redundant Multi-Scale Features for Time Series Classification,07/07/2025,"Zhipeng Liu, Peibo Duan, Binwu Wang, Xuan Tang, Qi Chu, Changsheng Zhang, Yongsheng Huang, Bin Zhang","Real-world time series typically exhibit complex temporal variations, making
the time series classification task notably challenging. Recent advancements
have demonstrated the potential of multi-scale analysis approaches, which
provide an effective solution for capturing these complex temporal patterns.
However, existing multi-scale analysis-based time series prediction methods
fail to eliminate redundant scale-shared features across multi-scale time
series, resulting in the model over- or under-focusing on scale-shared
features. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end Disentangled
Multi-Scale framework for Time Series classification (DisMS-TS). The core idea
of DisMS-TS is to eliminate redundant shared features in multi-scale time
series, thereby improving prediction performance. Specifically, we propose a
temporal disentanglement module to capture scale-shared and scale-specific
temporal representations, respectively. Subsequently, to effectively learn both
scale-shared and scale-specific temporal representations, we introduce two
regularization terms that ensure the consistency of scale-shared
representations and the disparity of scale-specific representations across all
temporal scales. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets validate
the superiority of DisMS-TS over its competitive baselines, with the accuracy
improvement up to 9.71%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.04600v1,,False
"Grounded Gesture Generation: Language, Motion, and Space",06/07/2025,"Anna Deichler, Jim O'Regan, Teo Guichoux, David Johansson, Jonas Beskow","Human motion generation has advanced rapidly in recent years, yet the
critical problem of creating spatially grounded, context-aware gestures has
been largely overlooked. Existing models typically specialize either in
descriptive motion generation, such as locomotion and object interaction, or in
isolated co-speech gesture synthesis aligned with utterance semantics. However,
both lines of work often treat motion and environmental grounding separately,
limiting advances toward embodied, communicative agents. To address this gap,
our work introduces a multimodal dataset and framework for grounded gesture
generation, combining two key resources: (1) a synthetic dataset of spatially
grounded referential gestures, and (2) MM-Conv, a VR-based dataset capturing
two-party dialogues. Together, they provide over 7.7 hours of synchronized
motion, speech, and 3D scene information, standardized in the HumanML3D format.
Our framework further connects to a physics-based simulator, enabling synthetic
data generation and situated evaluation. By bridging gesture modeling and
spatial grounding, our contribution establishes a foundation for advancing
research in situated gesture generation and grounded multimodal interaction.

Anomalous Decision Discovery using Inverse Reinforcement Learning,06/07/2025,"Ashish Bastola, Mert D. Pes√©, Long Cheng, Jonathon Smereka, Abolfazl Razi","Anomaly detection plays a critical role in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) by
identifying unusual behaviors through perception systems that could compromise
safety and lead to hazardous situations. Current approaches, which often rely
on predefined thresholds or supervised learning paradigms, exhibit reduced
efficacy when confronted with unseen scenarios, sensor noise, and occlusions,
leading to potential safety-critical failures. Moreover, supervised methods
require large annotated datasets, limiting their real-world feasibility. To
address these gaps, we propose an anomaly detection framework based on Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL) to infer latent driving intentions from sequential
perception data, thus enabling robust identification. Specifically, we present
Trajectory-Reward Guided Adaptive Pre-training (TRAP), a novel IRL framework
for anomaly detection, to address two critical limitations of existing methods:
noise robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. Our core innovation is
implicitly learning temporal credit assignments via reward and worst-case

improved the capabilities of web agents. However, effectively navigating
complex and dynamic web environments still requires more advanced
trajectory-level planning and execution. Prior studies have addressed
self-improving agents by collecting extensive GUI trajectories from
real-environment interactions. Despite their effectiveness, these approaches
encounter two critical challenges: (1) Uncontrollable environment states, where
real or sandboxed web environments often yield unstable and non-deterministic

(2) High API costs, as generating even a single interaction trajectory can
involve hundreds of queries, leading to considerable API usage and

SeqTex: Generate Mesh Textures in Video Sequence,06/07/2025,"Ze Yuan, Xin Yu, Yangtian Sun, Yuan-Chen Guo, Yan-Pei Cao, Ding Liang, Xiaojuan Qi","Training native 3D texture generative models remains a fundamental yet
challenging problem, largely due to the limited availability of large-scale,
high-quality 3D texture datasets. This scarcity hinders generalization to
real-world scenarios. To address this, most existing methods finetune
foundation image generative models to exploit their learned visual priors.
However, these approaches typically generate only multi-view images and rely on
post-processing to produce UV texture maps -- an essential representation in
modern graphics pipelines. Such two-stage pipelines often suffer from error
accumulation and spatial inconsistencies across the 3D surface. In this paper,
we introduce SeqTex, a novel end-to-end framework that leverages the visual
knowledge encoded in pretrained video foundation models to directly generate
complete UV texture maps. Unlike previous methods that model the distribution
of UV textures in isolation, SeqTex reformulates the task as a sequence
generation problem, enabling the model to learn the joint distribution of
multi-view renderings and UV textures. This design effectively transfers the
consistent image-space priors from video foundation models into the UV domain.
To further enhance performance, we propose several architectural innovations: a
decoupled multi-view and UV branch design, geometry-informed attention to guide
cross-domain feature alignment, and adaptive token resolution to preserve fine
texture details while maintaining computational efficiency. Together, these
components allow SeqTex to fully utilize pretrained video priors and synthesize
high-fidelity UV texture maps without the need for post-processing. Extensive

Efficient Training of Deep Networks using Guided Spectral Data Selection: A Step Toward Learning What You Need,06/07/2025,"Mohammadreza Sharifi, Ahad Harati","Effective data curation is essential for optimizing neural network training.
In this paper, we present the Guided Spectrally Tuned Data Selection (GSTDS)

training using an off-the-shelf pre-trained reference model. Based on a
pre-scheduled filtering ratio, GSTDS effectively reduces the number of data
points processed per batch. The proposed method ensures an efficient selection
of the most informative data points for training while avoiding redundant or
less beneficial computations. Preserving data points in each batch is performed
based on spectral analysis. A Fiedler vector-based scoring mechanism removes
the filtered portion of the batch, lightening the resource requirements of the
learning. The proposed data selection approach not only streamlines the
training process but also promotes improved generalization and accuracy.
Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks, including
CIFAR-10, Oxford-IIIT Pet, and Oxford-Flowers, demonstrate that GSTDS
outperforms standard training scenarios and JEST, a recent state-of-the-art
data curation method, on several key factors. It is shown that GSTDS achieves
notable reductions in computational requirements, up to four times, without
compromising performance. GSTDS exhibits a considerable growth in terms of
accuracy under the limited computational resource usage, in contrast to other

linear-cost sequence modeling whose state size can be adjusted independently of
parameters, unlocking the advantages of linear attention on practical domains.
We develop and open-source a set of GPU kernels for efficient power attention,

Generative Regression with IQ-BART,05/07/2025,"Sean O'Hagan, Veronika Roƒçkov√°","Implicit Quantile BART (IQ-BART) posits a non-parametric Bayesian model on
the conditional quantile function, acting as a model over a conditional model

$\{(Y_i,X_i)\}_{i=1}^n$ with uniformly sampled values $\tau_i$ for $1\leq i\leq
n$ which serve as training data for quantile function estimation. Using the
fact that the location parameter $\mu$ in a $\tau$-tilted asymmetric Laplace
distribution corresponds to the $\tau^{th}$ quantile, we build a check-loss
likelihood targeting $\mu$ as the parameter of interest. We equip the
check-loss likelihood parametrized by $\mu=f(X,\tau)$ with a BART prior on
$f(\cdot)$, allowing the conditional quantile function to vary both in $X$ and
$\tau$. The posterior distribution over $\mu(\tau,X)$ can be then distilled for
estimation of the {\em entire quantile function} as well as for assessing
uncertainty through the variation of posterior draws. Simulation-based
predictive inference is immediately available through inverse transform
sampling using the learned quantile function. The sum-of-trees structure over
the conditional quantile function enables flexible distribution-free regression
with theoretical guarantees. As a byproduct, we investigate posterior mean

Conversation Forests: The Key to Fine Tuning Large Language Models for Multi-Turn Medical Conversations is Branching,05/07/2025,Thomas Savage,"Fine-tuning methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have demonstrated success in training large

in multi-turn applications, such as diagnostic patient interviewing, where
understanding how early conversational turns influence downstream completions

for learning diagnostic schemas and better understanding conversation dynamics.
To address this gap, I introduce Savage Conversation Forests (SCF), a
reinforcement learning framework that leverages a branched conversation
architecture to fine-tune LLMs for multi-turn dialogue. SCF generates multiple
possible conversation continuations at each turn, enabling the model to learn
how different early responses affect downstream interactions and diagnostic
outcomes. In experiments simulating doctor-patient conversations, SCF with
branching outperforms linear conversation architectures on diagnostic accuracy.
I hypothesize that SCF's improvements stem from its ability to provide richer,

motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed
sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two
challenges. Firstly, generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the
varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly, the action
characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some
actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and
inconsistent. As a result, we propose two memory banks, the Soft-transition
Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB), to tackle the problems
above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with
the novel soft searching approach, which encourages the model to focus on
multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action
characteristic, which produces more prior information for predicting certain

velocities of individual halos and galaxies from their collective positions,
and to reconstruct merger trees on finer time scales from those on coarser time
scales. We provide several baselines on these tasks, some based on established
approaches from cosmological modeling and others rooted in machine learning.
For the latter, we study different approaches -- from simple linear models that
are minimally constrained by symmetries to much larger and more
computationally-demanding models in deep learning, such as graph neural
networks. We find that least-squares fits with a handful of invariant features
sometimes outperform deep architectures with many more parameters and far
longer training times. Still there remains tremendous potential to improve
these baselines by combining machine learning and cosmology to fully exploit
the data. CosmoBench sets the stage for bridging cosmology and geometric deep
learning at scale. We invite the community to push the frontier of scientific
discovery by engaging with this dataset, available at

Scientific Machine Learning of Chaotic Systems Discovers Governing Equations for Neural Populations,04/07/2025,"Anthony G. Chesebro, David Hofmann, Vaibhav Dixit, Earl K. Miller, Richard H. Granger, Alan Edelman, Christopher V. Rackauckas, Lilianne R. Mujica-Parodi, Helmut H. Strey","Discovering governing equations that describe complex chaotic systems remains
a fundamental challenge in physics and neuroscience. Here, we introduce the
PEM-UDE method, which combines the prediction-error method with universal
differential equations to extract interpretable mathematical expressions from
chaotic dynamical systems, even with limited or noisy observations. This
approach succeeds where traditional techniques fail by smoothing optimization
landscapes and removing the chaotic properties during the fitting process
without distorting optimal parameters. We demonstrate its efficacy by
recovering hidden states in the Rossler system and reconstructing dynamics from
noise-corrupted electrical circuit data, where the correct functional form of
the dynamics is recovered even when one of the observed time series is
corrupted by noise 5x the magnitude of the true signal. We demonstrate that
this method is capable of recovering the correct dynamics, whereas direct
symbolic regression methods, such as SINDy, fail to do so with the given amount
of data and noise. Importantly, when applied to neural populations, our method
derives novel governing equations that respect biological constraints such as
network sparsity - a constraint necessary for cortical information processing
yet not captured in next-generation neural mass models - while preserving
microscale neuronal parameters. These equations predict an emergent
relationship between connection density and both oscillation frequency and
synchrony in neural circuits. We validate these predictions using three
intracranial electrode recording datasets from the medial entorhinal cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and orbitofrontal cortex. Our work provides a pathway to
develop mechanistic, multi-scale brain models that generalize across diverse
neural architectures, bridging the gap between single-neuron dynamics and
macroscale brain activity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03631v1,,False
2.5D Object Detection for Intelligent Roadside Infrastructure,04/07/2025,"Nikolai Polley, Yacin Boualili, Ferdinand M√ºtsch, Maximilian Zipfl, Tobias Fleck, J. Marius Z√∂llner","On-board sensors of autonomous vehicles can be obstructed, occluded, or
limited by restricted fields of view, complicating downstream driving
decisions. Intelligent roadside infrastructure perception systems, installed at
elevated vantage points, can provide wide, unobstructed intersection coverage,
supplying a complementary information stream to autonomous vehicles via
vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. However, conventional 3D
object-detection algorithms struggle to generalize under the domain shift
introduced by top-down perspectives and steep camera angles. We introduce a
2.5D object detection framework, tailored specifically for infrastructure
roadside-mounted cameras. Unlike conventional 2D or 3D object detection, we
employ a prediction approach to detect ground planes of vehicles as
parallelograms in the image frame. The parallelogram preserves the planar
position, size, and orientation of objects while omitting their height, which
is unnecessary for most downstream applications. For training, a mix of
real-world and synthetically generated scenes is leveraged. We evaluate
generalizability on a held-out camera viewpoint and in adverse-weather
scenarios absent from the training set. Our results show high detection
accuracy, strong cross-viewpoint generalization, and robustness to diverse
lighting and weather conditions. Model weights and inference code are provided

Multimodal Alignment with Cross-Attentive GRUs for Fine-Grained Video Understanding,04/07/2025,"Namho Kim, Junhwa Kim","Fine-grained video classification requires understanding complex
spatio-temporal and semantic cues that often exceed the capacity of a single
modality. In this paper, we propose a multimodal framework that fuses video,
image, and text representations using GRU-based sequence encoders and
cross-modal attention mechanisms. The model is trained using a combination of
classification or regression loss, depending on the task, and is further
regularized through feature-level augmentation and autoencoding techniques. To
evaluate the generality of our framework, we conduct experiments on two
challenging benchmarks: the DVD dataset for real-world violence detection and
the Aff-Wild2 dataset for valence-arousal estimation. Our results demonstrate
that the proposed fusion strategy significantly outperforms unimodal baselines,
with cross-attention and feature augmentation contributing notably to
robustness and performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03531v1,,False
On the Effectiveness of the $z$-Transform Method in Quadratic Optimization,04/07/2025,Francis Bach,"The $z$-transform of a sequence is a classical tool used within signal
processing, control theory, computer science, and electrical engineering. It
allows for studying sequences from their generating functions, with many
operations that can be equivalently defined on the original sequence and its
$z$-transform. In particular, the $z$-transform method focuses on asymptotic
behaviors and allows the use of Taylor expansions. We present a sequence of
results of increasing significance and difficulty for linear models and
optimization algorithms, demonstrating the effectiveness and versatility of the
$z$-transform method in deriving new asymptotic results. Starting from the
simplest gradient descent iterations in an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space,
we show how the spectral dimension characterizes the convergence behavior. We
then extend the analysis to Nesterov acceleration, averaging techniques, and
stochastic gradient descent.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03404v1,,False
LLM4Hint: Leveraging Large Language Models for Hint Recommendation in Offline Query Optimization,04/07/2025,"Suchen Liu, Jun Gao, Yinjun Han, Yang Lin","Query optimization is essential for efficient SQL query execution in DBMS,
and remains attractive over time due to the growth of data volumes and advances
in hardware. Existing traditional optimizers struggle with the cumbersome
hand-tuning required for complex workloads, and the learning-based methods face
limitations in ensuring generalization. With the great success of Large
Language Model (LLM) across diverse downstream tasks, this paper explores how
LLMs can be incorporated to enhance the generalization of learned optimizers.
Though promising, such an incorporation still presents challenges, mainly
including high model inference latency, and the substantial fine-tuning cost
and suboptimal performance due to inherent discrepancy between the token
sequences in LLM and structured SQL execution plans with rich numerical
features.
  In this paper, we focus on recurring queries in offline optimization to
alleviate the issue of high inference latency, and propose \textbf{LLM4Hint}
that leverages moderate-sized backbone LLMs to recommend query optimization
hints. LLM4Hint achieves the goals through: (i) integrating a lightweight model
to produce a soft prompt, which captures the data distribution in DBMS and the
SQL predicates to provide sufficient optimization features while simultaneously
reducing the context length fed to the LLM, (ii) devising a query rewriting
strategy using a larger commercial LLM, so as to simplify SQL semantics for the
backbone LLM and reduce fine-tuning costs, and (iii) introducing an explicit
matching prompt to facilitate alignment between the LLM and the lightweight
model, which can accelerate convergence of the combined model. Experiments show
that LLM4Hint, by leveraging the LLM's stronger capability to understand the
query statement, can outperform the state-of-the-art learned optimizers in
terms of both effectiveness and generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.03384v1,,False
