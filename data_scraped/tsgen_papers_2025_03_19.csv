Cosmos-Transfer1: Conditional World Generation with Adaptive Multimodal Control,18/03/2025,"NVIDIA, :, Hassan Abu Alhaija, Jose Alvarez, Maciej Bala, Tiffany Cai, Tianshi Cao, Liz Cha, Joshua Chen, Mike Chen, Francesco Ferroni, Sanja Fidler, Dieter Fox, Yunhao Ge, Jinwei Gu, Ali Hassani, Michael Isaev, Pooya Jannaty, Shiyi Lan, Tobias Lasser, Huan Ling, Ming-Yu Liu, Xian Liu, Yifan Lu, Alice Luo, Qianli Ma, Hanzi Mao, Fabio Ramos, Xuanchi Ren, Tianchang Shen, Shitao Tang, Ting-Chun Wang, Jay Wu, Jiashu Xu, Stella Xu, Kevin Xie, Yuchong Ye, Xiaodong Yang, Xiaohui Zeng, Yu Zeng","We introduce Cosmos-Transfer, a conditional world generation model that can
generate world simulations based on multiple spatial control inputs of various
modalities such as segmentation, depth, and edge. In the design, the spatial
conditional scheme is adaptive and customizable. It allows weighting different
conditional inputs differently at different spatial locations. This enables
highly controllable world generation and finds use in various world-to-world
transfer use cases, including Sim2Real. We conduct extensive evaluations to
analyze the proposed model and demonstrate its applications for Physical AI,
including robotics Sim2Real and autonomous vehicle data enrichment. We further
demonstrate an inference scaling strategy to achieve real-time world generation

Wind, Tianyi Wu, Daniel Wuttke, Christian Zhou-Zheng","We present RWKV-7 ""Goose"", a new sequence modeling architecture, along with
pre-trained language models that establish a new state-of-the-art in downstream
performance at the 3 billion parameter scale on multilingual tasks, and match
current SoTA English language performance despite being trained on dramatically
fewer tokens than other top 3B models. Nevertheless, RWKV-7 models require only
constant memory usage and constant inference time per token. RWKV-7 introduces
a newly generalized formulation of the delta rule with vector-valued gating and
in-context learning rates, as well as a relaxed value replacement rule. We show
that RWKV-7 can perform state tracking and recognize all regular languages,
while retaining parallelizability of training. This exceeds the capabilities of
Transformers under standard complexity conjectures, which are limited to
$\mathsf{TC}^0$. To demonstrate RWKV-7's language modeling capability, we also
present an extended open source 3.1 trillion token multilingual corpus, and
train four RWKV-7 models ranging from 0.19 billion to 2.9 billion parameters on
this dataset.

Optimizing High-Dimensional Oblique Splits,18/03/2025,Chien-Ming Chi,"Orthogonal-split trees perform well, but evidence suggests oblique splits can
enhance their performance. This paper explores optimizing high-dimensional
$s$-sparse oblique splits from $\{(\vec{w}, \vec{w}^{\top}\boldsymbol{X}_{i}) :
i\in \{1,\dots, n\}, \vec{w} \in \mathbb{R}^p, \| \vec{w} \|_{2} = 1, \|
\vec{w} \|_{0} \leq s \}$ for growing oblique trees, where $ s $ is a
user-defined sparsity parameter. We establish a connection between SID
convergence and $s_0$-sparse oblique splits with $s_0\ge 1$, showing that the
SID function class expands as $s_0$ increases, enabling the capture of more
complex data-generating functions such as the $s_0$-dimensional XOR function.
Thus, $s_0$ represents the unknown potential complexity of the underlying
data-generating function. Learning these complex functions requires an
$s$-sparse oblique tree with $s \geq s_0$ and greater computational resources.
This highlights a trade-off between statistical accuracy, governed by the SID
function class size depending on $s_0$, and computational cost. In contrast,
previous studies have explored the problem of SID convergence using orthogonal
splits with $ s_0 = s = 1 $, where runtime was less critical. Additionally, we
introduce a practical framework for oblique trees that integrates optimized
oblique splits alongside orthogonal splits into random forests. The proposed
approach is assessed through simulations and real-data experiments, comparing
its performance against various oblique tree models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14381v1,,False
Tiled Flash Linear Attention: More Efficient Linear RNN and xLSTM Kernels,18/03/2025,"Maximilian Beck, Korbinian PÃ¶ppel, Phillip Lippe, Sepp Hochreiter","Linear RNNs with gating recently demonstrated competitive performance
compared to Transformers in language modeling. Although their linear compute
scaling in sequence length offers theoretical runtime advantages over
Transformers, realizing these benefits in practice requires optimized custom
kernels, as Transformers rely on the highly efficient Flash Attention kernels.
Leveraging the chunkwise-parallel formulation of linear RNNs, Flash Linear
Attention (FLA) shows that linear RNN kernels are faster than Flash Attention,
by parallelizing over chunks of the input sequence. However, since the chunk
size of FLA is limited, many intermediate states must be materialized in GPU
memory. This leads to low arithmetic intensity and causes high memory
consumption and IO cost, especially for long-context pre-training. In this
work, we present Tiled Flash Linear Attention (TFLA), a novel kernel algorithm
for linear RNNs, that enables arbitrary large chunk sizes by introducing an
additional level of sequence parallelization within each chunk. First, we apply
TFLA to the xLSTM with matrix memory, the mLSTM. Second, we propose an mLSTM
variant with sigmoid input gate and reduced computation for even faster kernel
runtimes at equal language modeling performance. In our speed benchmarks, we
show that our new mLSTM kernels based on TFLA outperform highly optimized Flash
Attention, Linear Attention and Mamba kernels, setting a new state of the art
for efficient long-context sequence modeling primitives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14376v1,,False
Retrospective: A CORDIC Based Configurable Activation Function for NN Applications,18/03/2025,"Omkar Kokane, Gopal Raut, Salim Ullah, Mukul Lokhande, Adam Teman, Akash Kumar, Santosh Kumar Vishvakarma","A CORDIC-based configuration for the design of Activation Functions (AF) was
previously suggested to accelerate ASIC hardware design for
resource-constrained systems by providing functional reconfigurability. Since
its introduction, this new approach for neural network acceleration has gained
widespread popularity, influencing numerous designs for activation functions in
both academic and commercial AI processors. In this retrospective analysis, we
explore the foundational aspects of this initiative, summarize key developments
over recent years, and introduce the DA-VINCI AF tailored for the evolving
needs of AI applications. This new generation of dynamically configurable and
precision-adjustable activation function cores promise greater adaptability for
a range of activation functions in AI workloads, including Swish, SoftMax,
SeLU, and GeLU, utilizing the Shift-and-Add CORDIC technique. The previously
presented design has been optimized for MAC, Sigmoid, and Tanh functionalities
and incorporated into ReLU AFs, culminating in an accumulative NEURIC compute
unit. These enhancements position NEURIC as a fundamental component in the
resource-efficient vector engine for the realization of AI accelerators that
focus on DNNs, RNNs/LSTMs, and Transformers, achieving a quality of results

PENCIL: Long Thoughts with Short Memory,18/03/2025,"Chenxiao Yang, Nathan Srebro, David McAllester, Zhiyuan Li","While recent works (e.g. o1, DeepSeek R1) have demonstrated great promise of
using long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) to improve reasoning capabilities of language
models, scaling it up during test-time is challenging due to inefficient memory
usage -- intermediate computations accumulate indefinitely in context even no
longer needed for future thoughts. We propose PENCIL, which incorporates a
reduction mechanism into the autoregressive generation process, allowing the
model to recursively clean up intermediate thoughts based on patterns learned
from training. With this reduction mechanism, PENCIL significantly reduces the
maximal context length required during generation, and thus can generate longer
thoughts with limited memory, solving larger-scale problems given more thinking
time. For example, we demonstrate PENCIL achieves 97\% accuracy on the
challenging Einstein's puzzle -- a task even large models like GPT-4 struggle
with -- using only a small 25M-parameter transformer with 2048 context length.
Theoretically, we prove PENCIL can perform universal space-efficient
computation by simulating Turing machines with optimal time and space
complexity, and thus can solve arbitrary computational tasks that would
otherwise be intractable given context window constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14337v1,,False
PC-Talk: Precise Facial Animation Control for Audio-Driven Talking Face Generation,18/03/2025,"Baiqin Wang, Xiangyu Zhu, Fan Shen, Hao Xu, Zhen Lei","Recent advancements in audio-driven talking face generation have made great
progress in lip synchronization. However, current methods often lack sufficient
control over facial animation such as speaking style and emotional expression,
resulting in uniform outputs. In this paper, we focus on improving two key
factors: lip-audio alignment and emotion control, to enhance the diversity and
user-friendliness of talking videos. Lip-audio alignment control focuses on
elements like speaking style and the scale of lip movements, whereas emotion
control is centered on generating realistic emotional expressions, allowing for
modifications in multiple attributes such as intensity. To achieve precise
control of facial animation, we propose a novel framework, PC-Talk, which
enables lip-audio alignment and emotion control through implicit keypoint
deformations. First, our lip-audio alignment control module facilitates precise
editing of speaking styles at the word level and adjusts lip movement scales to
simulate varying vocal loudness levels, maintaining lip synchronization with
the audio. Second, our emotion control module generates vivid emotional facial
features with pure emotional deformation. This module also enables the fine
modification of intensity and the combination of multiple emotions across
different facial regions. Our method demonstrates outstanding control
capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both HDTF and MEAD
datasets in extensive experiments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14295v1,,False
Ensemble Knowledge Distillation for Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials,18/03/2025,"Sakib Matin, Emily Shinkle, Yulia Pimonova, Galen T. Craven, Ying Wai Li, Kipton Barros, Nicholas Lubbers","Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are a promising tool to
accelerate atomistic simulations and molecular property prediction. The quality
of MLIPs strongly depends on the quantity of available training data as well as
the quantum chemistry (QC) level of theory used to generate that data. Datasets
generated with high-fidelity QC methods, such as coupled cluster, are typically
restricted to small molecules and may be missing energy gradients. With this
limited quantity of data, it is often difficult to train good MLIP models. We
present an ensemble knowledge distillation (EKD) method to improve MLIP
accuracy when trained to energy-only datasets. In our EKD approach, first,
multiple teacher models are trained to QC energies and then used to generate
atomic forces for all configurations in the dataset. Next, a student MLIP is
trained to both QC energies and to ensemble-averaged forces generated by the
teacher models. We apply this workflow on the ANI-1ccx dataset which consists
of organic molecules with configuration energies computed at the coupled
cluster level of theory. The resulting student MLIPs achieve new
state-of-the-art accuracy on the out-of-sample COMP6 benchmark and improved
stability for molecular dynamics simulations. The EKD approach for MLIP is
broadly applicable for chemical, biomolecular and materials science
simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14293v1,,False
Quantization-Free Autoregressive Action Transformer,18/03/2025,"Ziyad Sheebaelhamd, Michael Tschannen, Michael Muehlebach, Claire Vernade","Current transformer-based imitation learning approaches introduce discrete
action representations and train an autoregressive transformer decoder on the
resulting latent code. However, the initial quantization breaks the continuous
structure of the action space thereby limiting the capabilities of the
generative model. We propose a quantization-free method instead that leverages
Generative Infinite-Vocabulary Transformers (GIVT) as a direct, continuous
policy parametrization for autoregressive transformers. This simplifies the
imitation learning pipeline while achieving state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of popular simulated robotics tasks. We enhance our policy roll-outs by
carefully studying sampling algorithms, further improving the results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14259v1,,False
GeoFlow-SLAM: A Robust Tightly-Coupled RGBD-Inertial Fusion SLAM for Dynamic Legged Robotics,18/03/2025,"Tingyang Xiao, Xiaolin Zhou, Liu Liu, Wei Sui, Wei Feng, Jiaxiong Qiu, Xinjie Wang, Zhizhong Su","This paper presents GeoFlow-SLAM, a robust and effective Tightly-Coupled
RGBD-inertial SLAM for legged robots operating in highly dynamic
environments.By integrating geometric consistency, legged odometry constraints,
and dual-stream optical flow (GeoFlow), our method addresses three critical
challenges:feature matching and pose initialization failures during fast
locomotion and visual feature scarcity in texture-less scenes.Specifically, in
rapid motion scenarios, feature matching is notably enhanced by leveraging
dual-stream optical flow, which combines prior map points and poses.
Additionally, we propose a robust pose initialization method for fast
locomotion and IMU error in legged robots, integrating IMU/Legged odometry,
inter-frame Perspective-n-Point (PnP), and Generalized Iterative Closest Point
(GICP). Furthermore, a novel optimization framework that tightly couples
depth-to-map and GICP geometric constraints is first introduced to improve the
robustness and accuracy in long-duration, visually texture-less environments.
The proposed algorithms achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) on collected legged
robots and open-source datasets. To further promote research and development,

Concat-ID: Towards Universal Identity-Preserving Video Synthesis,18/03/2025,"Yong Zhong, Zhuoyi Yang, Jiayan Teng, Xiaotao Gu, Chongxuan Li","We present Concat-ID, a unified framework for identity-preserving video
generation. Concat-ID employs Variational Autoencoders to extract image
features, which are concatenated with video latents along the sequence
dimension, leveraging solely 3D self-attention mechanisms without the need for
additional modules. A novel cross-video pairing strategy and a multi-stage
training regimen are introduced to balance identity consistency and facial
editability while enhancing video naturalness. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Concat-ID's superiority over existing methods in both single and
multi-identity generation, as well as its seamless scalability to multi-subject
scenarios, including virtual try-on and background-controllable generation.
Concat-ID establishes a new benchmark for identity-preserving video synthesis,

"Fundamental Limits of Matrix Sensing: Exact Asymptotics, Universality, and Applications",18/03/2025,"Yizhou Xu, Antoine Maillard, Lenka ZdeborovÃ¡, Florent Krzakala","In the matrix sensing problem, one wishes to reconstruct a matrix from
(possibly noisy) observations of its linear projections along given directions.
We consider this model in the high-dimensional limit: while previous works on
this model primarily focused on the recovery of low-rank matrices, we consider
in this work more general classes of structured signal matrices with
potentially large rank, e.g. a product of two matrices of sizes proportional to
the dimension. We provide rigorous asymptotic equations characterizing the
Bayes-optimal learning performance from a number of samples which is
proportional to the number of entries in the matrix. Our proof is composed of
three key ingredients: $(i)$ we prove universality properties to handle
structured sensing matrices, related to the ''Gaussian equivalence'' phenomenon
in statistical learning, $(ii)$ we provide a sharp characterization of
Bayes-optimal learning in generalized linear models with Gaussian data and
structured matrix priors, generalizing previously studied settings, and $(iii)$
we leverage previous works on the problem of matrix denoising. The generality
of our results allow for a variety of applications: notably, we mathematically
establish predictions obtained via non-rigorous methods from statistical
physics in [ETB+24] regarding Bilinear Sequence Regression, a benchmark model
for learning from sequences of tokens, and in [MTM+24] on Bayes-optimal
learning in neural networks with quadratic activation function, and width

"PET-MAD, a universal interatomic potential for advanced materials modeling",18/03/2025,"Arslan Mazitov, Filippo Bigi, Matthias Kellner, Paolo Pegolo, Davide Tisi, Guillaume Fraux, Sergey Pozdnyakov, Philip Loche, Michele Ceriotti","Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) have greatly extended the
reach of atomic-scale simulations, offering the accuracy of first-principles
calculations at a fraction of the effort. Leveraging large quantum mechanical

qualitative accuracy across the periodic table but are often biased toward
low-energy configurations. We introduce PET-MAD, a generally applicable MLIP
trained on a dataset combining stable inorganic and organic solids,
systematically modified to enhance atomic diversity. Using a moderate but
highly-consistent level of electronic-structure theory, we assess PET-MAD's
accuracy on established benchmarks and advanced simulations of six materials.
PET-MAD rivals state-of-the-art MLIPs for inorganic solids, while also being
reliable for molecules, organic materials, and surfaces. It is stable and fast,

Toward Large-Scale Distributed Quantum Long Short-Term Memory with Modular Quantum Computers,18/03/2025,"Kuan-Cheng Chen, Samuel Yen-Chi Chen, Chen-Yu Liu, Kin K. Leung","In this work, we introduce a Distributed Quantum Long Short-Term Memory
(QLSTM) framework that leverages modular quantum computing to address
scalability challenges on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. By
embedding variational quantum circuits into LSTM cells, the QLSTM captures
long-range temporal dependencies, while a distributed architecture partitions
the underlying Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) into smaller, manageable
subcircuits that can be executed on a network of quantum processing units. We
assess the proposed framework using nontrivial benchmark problems such as
damped harmonic oscillators and Nonlinear Autoregressive Moving Average
sequences. Our results demonstrate that the distributed QLSTM achieves stable
convergence and improved training dynamics compared to classical approaches.
This work underscores the potential of modular, distributed quantum computing

"Theoretical Foundation of Flow-Based Time Series Generation: Provable Approximation, Generalization, and Efficiency",18/03/2025,"Jiangxuan Long, Zhao Song, Chiwun Yang","Recent studies suggest utilizing generative models instead of traditional
auto-regressive algorithms for time series forecasting (TSF) tasks. These
non-auto-regressive approaches involving different generative methods,
including GAN, Diffusion, and Flow Matching for time series, have empirically
demonstrated high-quality generation capability and accuracy. However, we still
lack an appropriate understanding of how it processes approximation and
generalization. This paper presents the first theoretical framework from the
perspective of flow-based generative models to relieve the knowledge of
limitations. In particular, we provide our insights with strict guarantees from
three perspectives: $\textbf{Approximation}$, $\textbf{Generalization}$ and
$\textbf{Efficiency}$. In detail, our analysis achieves the contributions as
follows:
  $\bullet$ By assuming a general data model, the fitting of the flow-based
generative models is confirmed to converge to arbitrary error under the
universal approximation of Diffusion Transformer (DiT).
  $\bullet$ Introducing a polynomial-based regularization for flow matching,
the generalization error thus be bounded since the generalization of polynomial
approximation.
  $\bullet$ The sampling for generation is considered as an optimization

gradient descent of some objective.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14076v1,,False
MoK-RAG: Mixture of Knowledge Paths Enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Embodied AI Environments,18/03/2025,"Zhengsheng Guo, Linwei Zheng, Xinyang Chen, Xuefeng Bai, Kehai Chen, Min Zhang","While human cognition inherently retrieves information from diverse and
specialized knowledge sources during decision-making processes, current
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems typically operate through
single-source knowledge retrieval, leading to a cognitive-algorithmic
discrepancy. To bridge this gap, we introduce MoK-RAG, a novel multi-source RAG
framework that implements a mixture of knowledge paths enhanced retrieval
mechanism through functional partitioning of a large language model (LLM)
corpus into distinct sections, enabling retrieval from multiple specialized
knowledge paths. Applied to the generation of 3D simulated environments, our
proposed MoK-RAG3D enhances this paradigm by partitioning 3D assets into
distinct sections and organizing them based on a hierarchical knowledge tree
structure. Different from previous methods that only use manual evaluation, we
pioneered the introduction of automated evaluation methods for 3D scenes. Both

Out-of-Distribution Generalization in Time Series: A Survey,18/03/2025,"Xin Wu, Fei Teng, Xingwang Li, Ji Zhang, Tianrui Li, Qiang Duan","Time series frequently manifest distribution shifts, diverse latent features,

The Empty Chair: Using LLMs to Raise Missing Perspectives in Policy Deliberations,18/03/2025,"Suyash Fulay, Deb Roy","Deliberation is essential to well-functioning democracies, yet physical,
economic, and social barriers often exclude certain groups, reducing
representativeness and contributing to issues like group polarization. In this

that transcribes conversations in real-time and simulates input from relevant
but absent stakeholders. We deploy this tool in a 19-person student citizens'
assembly on campus sustainability. Participants and facilitators found that the
tool sparked new discussions and surfaced valuable perspectives they had not
previously considered. However, they also noted that AI-generated responses
