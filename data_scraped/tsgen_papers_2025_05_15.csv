Online Isolation Forest,14/05/2025,"Filippo Leveni, Guilherme Weigert Cassales, Bernhard Pfahringer, Albert Bifet, Giacomo Boracchi","The anomaly detection literature is abundant with offline methods, which
require repeated access to data in memory, and impose impractical assumptions
when applied to a streaming context. Existing online anomaly detection methods
also generally fail to address these constraints, resorting to periodic
retraining to adapt to the online context. We propose Online-iForest, a novel
method explicitly designed for streaming conditions that seamlessly tracks the
data generating process as it evolves over time. Experimental validation on
real-world datasets demonstrated that Online-iForest is on par with online
alternatives and closely rivals state-of-the-art offline anomaly detection
techniques that undergo periodic retraining. Notably, Online-iForest
consistently outperforms all competitors in terms of efficiency, making it a
promising solution in applications where fast identification of anomalies is of
primary importance such as cybersecurity, fraud and fault detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09593v1,10.5555/3692070.3693158,False
Scalable Computations for Generalized Mixed Effects Models with Crossed Random Effects Using Krylov Subspace Methods,14/05/2025,"Pascal Kündig, Fabio Sigrist","Mixed effects models are widely used for modeling data with hierarchically
grouped structures and high-cardinality categorical predictor variables.
However, for high-dimensional crossed random effects, current standard
computations relying on Cholesky decompositions can become prohibitively slow.
In this work, we present novel Krylov subspace-based methods that address
several existing computational bottlenecks. Among other things, we
theoretically analyze and empirically evaluate various preconditioners for the
conjugate gradient and stochastic Lanczos quadrature methods, derive new
convergence results, and develop computationally efficient methods for
calculating predictive variances. Extensive experiments using simulated and
real-world data sets show that our proposed methods scale much better than
Cholesky-based computations, for instance, achieving a runtime reduction of
approximately two orders of magnitudes for both estimation and prediction.
Moreover, our software implementation is up to 10'000 times faster and more
stable than state-of-the-art implementations such as lme4 and glmmTMB when
using default settings. Our methods are implemented in the free C++ software
library GPBoost with high-level Python and R packages.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09552v1,,False
Contactless Cardiac Pulse Monitoring Using Event Cameras,14/05/2025,"Mohamed Moustafa, Joseph Lemley, Peter Corcoran","Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at
extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a
stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within
the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal
resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free
reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event
recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN)
model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a
two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance
evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental
results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is
effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this
novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event
frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm)
compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on
standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated
at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an
RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09529v1,,False
CXMArena: Unified Dataset to benchmark performance in realistic CXM Scenarios,14/05/2025,"Raghav Garg, Kapil Sharma, Karan Gupta","Large Language Models (LLMs) hold immense potential for revolutionizing
Customer Experience Management (CXM), particularly in contact center
operations. However, evaluating their practical utility in complex operational
environments is hindered by data scarcity (due to privacy concerns) and the
limitations of current benchmarks. Existing benchmarks often lack realism,
failing to incorporate deep knowledge base (KB) integration, real-world noise,
or critical operational tasks beyond conversational fluency. To bridge this
gap, we introduce CXMArena, a novel, large-scale synthetic benchmark dataset
specifically designed for evaluating AI in operational CXM contexts. Given the
diversity in possible contact center features, we have developed a scalable
LLM-powered pipeline that simulates the brand's CXM entities that form the
foundation of our datasets-such as knowledge articles including product
specifications, issue taxonomies, and contact center conversations. The
entities closely represent real-world distribution because of controlled noise
injection (informed by domain experts) and rigorous automated validation.
Building on this, we release CXMArena, which provides dedicated benchmarks
targeting five important operational tasks: Knowledge Base Refinement, Intent
Prediction, Agent Quality Adherence, Article Search, and Multi-turn RAG with
Integrated Tools. Our baseline experiments underscore the benchmark's
difficulty: even state of the art embedding and generation models achieve only
68% accuracy on article search, while standard embedding methods yield a low F1
score of 0.3 for knowledge base refinement, highlighting significant challenges
for current models necessitating complex pipelines and solutions over
conventional techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09436v1,,False
Train a Multi-Task Diffusion Policy on RLBench-18 in One Day with One GPU,14/05/2025,"Yutong Hu, Pinhao Song, Kehan Wen, Renaud Detry","We present a method for training multi-task vision-language robotic diffusion
policies that reduces training time and memory usage by an order of magnitude.
This improvement arises from a previously underexplored distinction between
action diffusion and the image diffusion techniques that inspired it: image
generation targets are high-dimensional, while robot actions lie in a much
lower-dimensional space. Meanwhile, the vision-language conditions for action
generation remain high-dimensional. Our approach, Mini-Diffuser, exploits this
asymmetry by introducing Level-2 minibatching, which pairs multiple noised
action samples with each vision-language condition, instead of the conventional
one-to-one sampling strategy. To support this batching scheme, we introduce
architectural adaptations to the diffusion transformer that prevent information
leakage across samples while maintaining full conditioning access. In RLBench
simulations, Mini-Diffuser achieves 95\% of the performance of state-of-the-art
multi-task diffusion policies, while using only 5\% of the training time and
7\% of the memory. Real-world experiments further validate that Mini-Diffuser
preserves the key strengths of diffusion-based policies, including the ability
to model multimodal action distributions and produce behavior conditioned on
diverse perceptual inputs. Code available at

Independent Component Analysis by Robust Distance Correlation,14/05/2025,"Sarah Leyder, Jakob Raymaekers, Peter J. Rousseeuw, Tom Van Deuren, Tim Verdonck","Independent component analysis (ICA) is a powerful tool for decomposing a
multivariate signal or distribution into fully independent sources, not just
uncorrelated ones. Unfortunately, most approaches to ICA are not robust against
outliers. Here we propose a robust ICA method called RICA, which estimates the
components by minimizing a robust measure of dependence between multivariate
random variables. The dependence measure used is the distance correlation
(dCor). In order to make it more robust we first apply a new transformation
called the bowl transform, which is bounded, one-to-one, continuous, and maps
far outliers to points close to the origin. This preserves the crucial property
that a zero dCor implies independence. RICA estimates the independent sources
sequentially, by looking for the component that has the smallest dCor with the
remainder. RICA is strongly consistent and has the usual parametric rate of
convergence. Its robustness is investigated by a simulation study, in which it
generally outperforms its competitors. The method is illustrated on three
applications, including the well-known cocktail party problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09425v1,,False
Multilingual Machine Translation with Quantum Encoder Decoder Attention-based Convolutional Variational Circuits,14/05/2025,"Subrit Dikshit, Ritu Tiwari, Priyank Jain","Cloud-based multilingual translation services like Google Translate and
Microsoft Translator achieve state-of-the-art translation capabilities. These
services inherently use large multilingual language models such as GRU, LSTM,
BERT, GPT, T5, or similar encoder-decoder architectures with attention
mechanisms as the backbone. Also, new age natural language systems, for
instance ChatGPT and DeepSeek, have established huge potential in multiple
tasks in natural language processing. At the same time, they also possess
outstanding multilingual translation capabilities. However, these models use
the classical computing realm as a backend. QEDACVC (Quantum Encoder Decoder
Attention-based Convolutional Variational Circuits) is an alternate solution
that explores the quantum computing realm instead of the classical computing
realm to study and demonstrate multilingual machine translation. QEDACVC
introduces the quantum encoder-decoder architecture that simulates and runs on

TensorRL-QAS: Reinforcement learning with tensor networks for scalable quantum architecture search,14/05/2025,"Akash Kundu, Stefano Mangini","Variational quantum algorithms hold the promise to address meaningful quantum
problems already on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, but they face
the challenge of designing quantum circuits that both solve the target problem
and comply with device limitations. Quantum architecture search (QAS) automates
this design process, with reinforcement learning (RL) emerging as a promising
approach. Yet, RL-based QAS methods encounter significant scalability issues,
as computational and training costs grow rapidly with the number of qubits,
circuit depth, and noise, severely impacting performance. To address these
challenges, we introduce $\textit{TensorRL-QAS}$, a scalable framework that
combines tensor network (TN) methods with RL for designing quantum circuits. By
warm-starting the architecture search with a matrix product state approximation
of the target solution, TensorRL-QAS effectively narrows the search space to
physically meaningful circuits, accelerating convergence to the desired
solution. Tested on several quantum chemistry problems of up to 12-qubit,
TensorRL-QAS achieves up to a 10-fold reduction in CNOT count and circuit depth
compared to baseline methods, while maintaining or surpassing chemical
accuracy. It reduces function evaluations by up to 100-fold, accelerates
training episodes by up to $98\%$, and achieves up to $50\%$ success
probability for 10-qubit systems-far exceeding the $<1\%$ rates of baseline
approaches. Robustness and versatility are demonstrated both in the noiseless
and noisy scenarios, where we report a simulation of up to 8-qubit. These
advancements establish TensorRL-QAS as a promising candidate for a scalable and
efficient quantum circuit discovery protocol on near-term quantum hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09371v1,,False
MUST: Multi-Scale Structural-Temporal Link Prediction Model for UAV Ad Hoc Networks,14/05/2025,"Cunlai Pu, Fangrui Wu, Rajput Ramiz Sharafat, Guangzhao Dai, Xiangbo Shu","Link prediction in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) ad hoc networks (UANETs)
aims to predict the potential formation of future links between UAVs. In
adversarial environments where the route information of UAVs is unavailable,
predicting future links must rely solely on the observed historical topological
information of UANETs. However, the highly dynamic and sparse nature of UANET
topologies presents substantial challenges in effectively capturing meaningful
structural and temporal patterns for accurate link prediction. Most existing
link prediction methods focus on temporal dynamics at a single structural scale
while neglecting the effects of sparsity, resulting in insufficient information
capture and limited applicability to UANETs. In this paper, we propose a
multi-scale structural-temporal link prediction model (MUST) for UANETs.
Specifically, we first employ graph attention networks (GATs) to capture
structural features at multiple levels, including the individual UAV level, the
UAV community level, and the overall network level. Then, we use long
short-term memory (LSTM) networks to learn the temporal dynamics of these
multi-scale structural features. Additionally, we address the impact of
sparsity by introducing a sophisticated loss function during model
optimization. We validate the performance of MUST using several UANET datasets
generated through simulations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that
MUST achieves state-of-the-art link prediction performance in highly dynamic
and sparse UANETs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09331v1,,False
Accelerating Machine Learning Systems via Category Theory: Applications to Spherical Attention for Gene Regulatory Networks,14/05/2025,"Vincent Abbott, Kotaro Kamiya, Gerard Glowacki, Yu Atsumi, Gioele Zardini, Yoshihiro Maruyama","How do we enable artificial intelligence models to improve themselves? This
is central to exponentially improving generalized artificial intelligence
models, which can improve their own architecture to handle new problem domains
in an efficient manner that leverages the latest hardware. However, current
automated compilation methods are poor, and efficient algorithms require years
of human development. In this paper, we use neural circuit diagrams, based in
category theory, to prove a general theorem related to deep learning
algorithms, guide the development of a novel attention algorithm catered to the
domain of gene regulatory networks, and produce a corresponding efficient
kernel. The algorithm we propose, spherical attention, shows that neural
circuit diagrams enable a principled and systematic method for reasoning about
deep learning architectures and providing high-performance code. By replacing
SoftMax with an $L^2$ norm as suggested by diagrams, it overcomes the special
function unit bottleneck of standard attention while retaining the streaming
property essential to high-performance. Our diagrammatically derived
\textit{FlashSign} kernel achieves comparable performance to the
state-of-the-art, fine-tuned FlashAttention algorithm on an A100, and
$3.6\times$ the performance of PyTorch. Overall, this investigation shows
neural circuit diagrams' suitability as a high-level framework for the
automated development of efficient, novel artificial intelligence
architectures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09326v1,,False
"Reproducibility Study of ""Cooperate or Collapse: Emergence of Sustainable Cooperation in a Society of LLM Agents""",14/05/2025,"Pedro M. P. Curvo, Mara Dragomir, Salvador Torpes, Mohammadmahdi Rahimi","This study evaluates and extends the findings made by Piatti et al., who
introduced GovSim, a simulation framework designed to assess the cooperative
decision-making capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in
resource-sharing scenarios. By replicating key experiments, we validate claims
regarding the performance of large models, such as GPT-4-turbo, compared to
smaller models. The impact of the universalization principle is also examined,
with results showing that large models can achieve sustainable cooperation,
with or without the principle, while smaller models fail without it. In
addition, we provide multiple extensions to explore the applicability of the
framework to new settings. We evaluate additional models, such as DeepSeek-V3
and GPT-4o-mini, to test whether cooperative behavior generalizes across
different architectures and model sizes. Furthermore, we introduce new
settings: we create a heterogeneous multi-agent environment, study a scenario
using Japanese instructions, and explore an ""inverse environment"" where agents
must cooperate to mitigate harmful resource distributions. Our results confirm
that the benchmark can be applied to new models, scenarios, and languages,
offering valuable insights into the adaptability of LLMs in complex cooperative
tasks. Moreover, the experiment involving heterogeneous multi-agent systems
demonstrates that high-performing models can influence lower-performing ones to
adopt similar behaviors. This finding has significant implications for other
agent-based applications, potentially enabling more efficient use of
computational resources and contributing to the development of more effective
cooperative AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09289v1,,False
Generating Full-field Evolution of Physical Dynamics from Irregular Sparse Observations,14/05/2025,"Panqi Chen, Yifan Sun, Lei Cheng, Yang Yang, Weichang Li, Yang Liu, Weiqing Liu, Jiang Bian, Shikai Fang","Modeling and reconstructing multidimensional physical dynamics from sparse
and off-grid observations presents a fundamental challenge in scientific
research. Recently, diffusion-based generative modeling shows promising
potential for physical simulation. However, current approaches typically
operate on on-grid data with preset spatiotemporal resolution, but struggle
with the sparsely observed and continuous nature of real-world physical
dynamics. To fill the gaps, we present SDIFT, Sequential DIffusion in
Functional Tucker space, a novel framework that generates full-field evolution
of physical dynamics from irregular sparse observations. SDIFT leverages the
functional Tucker model as the latent space representer with proven universal
approximation property, and represents observations as latent functions and
Tucker core sequences. We then construct a sequential diffusion model with
temporally augmented UNet in the functional Tucker space, denoising noise drawn
from a Gaussian process to generate the sequence of core tensors.
  At the posterior sampling stage, we propose a Message-Passing Posterior
Sampling mechanism, enabling conditional generation of the entire sequence
guided by observations at limited time steps. We validate SDIFT on three
physical systems spanning astronomical (supernova explosions, light-year
scale), environmental (ocean sound speed fields, kilometer scale), and
molecular (organic liquid, millimeter scale) domains, demonstrating significant
improvements in both reconstruction accuracy and computational efficiency
compared to state-of-the-art approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09284v1,,False
Optimizing Urban Critical Green Space Development Using Machine Learning,14/05/2025,"Mohammad Ganjirad, Mahmoud Reza Delavar, Hossein Bagheri, Mohammad Mehdi Azizi","This paper presents a novel framework for prioritizing urban green space
development in Tehran using diverse socio-economic, environmental, and
sensitivity indices. The indices were derived from various sources including
Google Earth Engine, air pollution measurements, municipal reports and the
Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model. The WRF model was used to estimate
the air temperature at a 1 km resolution due to insufficient meteorological
stations, yielding RMSE and MAE values of 0.96{\deg}C and 0.92{\deg}C,
respectively. After data preparation, several machine learning models were used
for binary vegetation cover classification including XGBoost, LightGBM, Random
Forest (RF) and Extra Trees. RF achieved the highest performance, exceeding 94%
in Overall Accuracy, Recall, and F1-score. Then, the probability of areas
lacking vegetation cover was assessed using socio-economic, environmental and
sensitivity indices. This resulted in the RF generating an urban green space
development prioritization map. Feature Importance Analysis revealed that the
most significant indices were nightly land surface temperature (LST) and
sensitive population. Finally, the framework performance was validated through
microclimate simulation to assess the critical areas after and before the green
space development by green roofs. The simulation demonstrated reducing air
temperature by up to 0.67{\deg}C after utilizing the green roof technology in
critical areas. As a result, this framework provides a valuable tool for urban
planners to develop green spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09175v1,10.1016/j.scs.2025.106158,False
Online Learning of Neural Networks,14/05/2025,"Amit Daniely, Idan Mehalel, Elchanan Mossel","We study online learning of feedforward neural networks with the sign
activation function that implement functions from the unit ball in
$\mathbb{R}^d$ to a finite label set $\{1, \ldots, Y\}$.
  First, we characterize a margin condition that is sufficient and in some
cases necessary for online learnability of a neural network: Every neuron in
the first hidden layer classifies all instances with some margin $\gamma$
bounded away from zero. Quantitatively, we prove that for any net, the optimal
mistake bound is at most approximately $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$, which is the
$(d,\gamma)$-totally-separable-packing number, a more restricted variation of
the standard $(d,\gamma)$-packing number. We complement this result by
constructing a net on which any learner makes $\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma)$ many
mistakes. We also give a quantitative lower bound of approximately
$\mathtt{TS}(d,\gamma) \geq \max\{1/(\gamma \sqrt{d})^d, d\}$ when $\gamma \geq
1/2$, implying that for some nets and input sequences every learner will err
for $\exp(d)$ many times, and that a dimension-free mistake bound is almost
always impossible.
  To remedy this inevitable dependence on $d$, it is natural to seek additional
natural restrictions to be placed on the network, so that the dependence on $d$
is removed. We study two such restrictions. The first is the multi-index model,
in which the function computed by the net depends only on $k \ll d$ orthonormal
directions. We prove a mistake bound of approximately $(1.5/\gamma)^{k + 2}$ in
this model. The second is the extended margin assumption. In this setting, we
assume that all neurons (in all layers) in the network classify every ingoing
input from previous layer with margin $\gamma$ bounded away from zero. In this
model, we prove a mistake bound of approximately $(\log Y)/ \gamma^{O(L)}$,
where L is the depth of the network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09167v1,,False
Sequential Treatment Effect Estimation with Unmeasured Confounders,14/05/2025,"Yingrong Wang, Anpeng Wu, Baohong Li, Ziyang Xiao, Ruoxuan Xiong, Qing Han, Kun Kuang","This paper studies the cumulative causal effects of sequential treatments in
the presence of unmeasured confounders. It is a critical issue in sequential
decision-making scenarios where treatment decisions and outcomes dynamically
evolve over time. Advanced causal methods apply transformer as a backbone to
model such time sequences, which shows superiority in capturing long time
dependence and periodic patterns via attention mechanism. However, even they
control the observed confounding, these estimators still suffer from unmeasured
confounders, which influence both treatment assignments and outcomes. How to
adjust the latent confounding bias in sequential treatment effect estimation
remains an open challenge. Therefore, we propose a novel Decomposing Sequential
Instrumental Variable framework for CounterFactual Regression (DSIV-CFR),
relying on a common negative control assumption. Specifically, an instrumental
variable (IV) is a special negative control exposure, while the previous
outcome serves as a negative control outcome. This allows us to recover the IVs
latent in observation variables and estimate sequential treatment effects via a
generalized moment condition. We conducted experiments on 4 datasets and
achieved significant performance in one- and multi-step prediction, supported
by which we can identify optimal treatments for dynamic systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.09113v1,,False
DPN-GAN: Inducing Periodic Activations in Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Fidelity Audio Synthesis,14/05/2025,"Zeeshan Ahmad, Shudi Bao, Meng Chen","In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant
progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on
bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated
audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To
address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN),
a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU
activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This
innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce
intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN
module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution
operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and
fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator
network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and
generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions
of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M
parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both
speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of
the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers
superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its
robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN
outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics,

Generating time-consistent dynamics with discriminator-guided image diffusion models,14/05/2025,"Philipp Hess, Maximilian Gelbrecht, Christof Schötz, Michael Aich, Yu Huang, Shangshang Yang, Niklas Boers","Realistic temporal dynamics are crucial for many video generation, processing
and modelling applications, e.g. in computational fluid dynamics, weather

the current state-of-the-art method for generating highly realistic dynamics.
However, training VDMs from scratch can be challenging and requires large
computational resources, limiting their wider application. Here, we propose a
time-consistency discriminator that enables pretrained image diffusion models
to generate realistic spatiotemporal dynamics. The discriminator guides the
sampling inference process and does not require extensions or finetuning of the
image diffusion model. We compare our approach against a VDM trained from
scratch on an idealized turbulence simulation and a real-world global
precipitation dataset. Our approach performs equally well in terms of temporal
consistency, shows improved uncertainty calibration and lower biases compared
to the VDM, and achieves stable centennial-scale climate simulations at daily

Single-shot prediction of parametric partial differential equations,14/05/2025,"Khalid Rafiq, Wenjing Liao, Aditya G. Nair","We introduce Flexi-VAE, a data-driven framework for efficient single-shot
forecasting of nonlinear parametric partial differential equations (PDEs),
eliminating the need for iterative time-stepping while maintaining high

advances latent representations forward in time, aligning latent evolution with
physical state reconstruction in a variational autoencoder setting. We evaluate
two propagation strategies, the Direct Concatenation Propagator (DCP) and the
Positional Encoding Propagator (PEP), and demonstrate, through
representation-theoretic analysis, that DCP offers superior long-term
generalization by fostering disentangled and physically meaningful latent
spaces. Geometric diagnostics, including Jacobian spectral analysis, reveal
that propagated latent states reside in regions of lower decoder sensitivity
and more stable local geometry than those derived via direct encoding,
enhancing robustness for long-horizon predictions. We validate Flexi-VAE on
canonical PDE benchmarks, the 1D viscous Burgers equation and the 2D
advection-diffusion equation, achieving accurate forecasts across wide
parametric ranges. The model delivers over 50x CPU and 90x GPU speedups
compared to autoencoder-LSTM baselines for large temporal shifts. These results
