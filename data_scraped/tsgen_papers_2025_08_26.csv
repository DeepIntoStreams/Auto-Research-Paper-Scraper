SafeBimanual: Diffusion-based Trajectory Optimization for Safe Bimanual Manipulation,25/08/2025,"Haoyuan Deng, Wenkai Guo, Qianzhun Wang, Zhenyu Wu, Ziwei Wang","Bimanual manipulation has been widely applied in household services and
manufacturing, which enables the complex task completion with coordination
requirements. Recent diffusion-based policy learning approaches have achieved
promising performance in modeling action distributions for bimanual
manipulation. However, they ignored the physical safety constraints of bimanual
manipulation, which leads to the dangerous behaviors with damage to robots and
objects. To this end, we propose a test-time trajectory optimization framework
named SafeBimanual for any pre-trained diffusion-based bimanual manipulation
policies, which imposes the safety constraints on bimanual actions to avoid
dangerous robot behaviors with improved success rate. Specifically, we design
diverse cost functions for safety constraints in different dual-arm cooperation
patterns including avoidance of tearing objects and collision between arms and
objects, which optimizes the manipulator trajectories with guided sampling of
diffusion denoising process. Moreover, we employ a vision-language model (VLM)
to schedule the cost functions by specifying keypoints and corresponding
pairwise relationship, so that the optimal safety constraint is dynamically
generated in the entire bimanual manipulation process. SafeBimanual
demonstrates superiority on 8 simulated tasks in RoboTwin with a 13.7% increase
in success rate and a 18.8% reduction in unsafe interactions over
state-of-the-art diffusion-based methods. Extensive experiments on 4 real-world
tasks further verify its practical value by improving the success rate by
32.5%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18268v1,,False
Amortized Sampling with Transferable Normalizing Flows,25/08/2025,"Charlie B. Tan, Majdi Hassan, Leon Klein, Saifuddin Syed, Dominique Beaini, Michael M. Bronstein, Alexander Tong, Kirill Neklyudov","Efficient equilibrium sampling of molecular conformations remains a core
challenge in computational chemistry and statistical inference. Classical
approaches such as molecular dynamics or Markov chain Monte Carlo inherently
lack amortization; the computational cost of sampling must be paid in-full for
each system of interest. The widespread success of generative models has
inspired interest into overcoming this limitation through learning sampling
algorithms. Despite performing on par with conventional methods when trained on
a single system, learned samplers have so far demonstrated limited ability to
transfer across systems. We prove that deep learning enables the design of
scalable and transferable samplers by introducing Prose, a 280 million
parameter all-atom transferable normalizing flow trained on a corpus of peptide
molecular dynamics trajectories up to 8 residues in length. Prose draws
zero-shot uncorrelated proposal samples for arbitrary peptide systems,
achieving the previously intractable transferability across sequence length,
whilst retaining the efficient likelihood evaluation of normalizing flows.
Through extensive empirical evaluation we demonstrate the efficacy of Prose as
a proposal for a variety of sampling algorithms, finding a simple importance
sampling-based finetuning procedure to achieve superior performance to
established methods such as sequential Monte Carlo on unseen tetrapeptides. We
open-source the Prose codebase, model weights, and training dataset, to further
stimulate research into amortized sampling methods and finetuning objectives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18175v1,,False
The Computational Complexity of Satisfiability in State Space Models,25/08/2025,"Eric Alsmann, Martin Lange","We analyse the complexity of the satisfiability problem ssmSAT for State
Space Models (SSM), which asks whether an input sequence can lead the model to
an accepting configuration. We find that ssmSAT is undecidable in general,
reflecting the computational power of SSM. Motivated by practical settings, we
identify two natural restrictions under which ssmSAT becomes decidable and
establish corresponding complexity bounds. First, for SSM with bounded context
length, ssmSAT is NP-complete when the input length is given in unary and in
NEXPTIME (and PSPACE-hard) when the input length is given in binary. Second,
for quantised SSM operating over fixed-width arithmetic, ssmSAT is
PSPACE-complete resp. in EXPSPACE depending on the bit-width encoding. While
these results hold for diagonal gated SSM we also establish complexity bounds
for time-invariant SSM. Our results establish a first complexity landscape for
formal reasoning in SSM and highlight fundamental limits and opportunities for
the verification of SSM-based language models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18162v1,,False
Frozen in Time: Parameter-Efficient Time Series Transformers via Reservoir-Induced Feature Expansion and Fixed Random Dynamics,25/08/2025,"Pradeep Singh, Mehak Sharma, Anupriya Dey, Balasubramanian Raman","Transformers are the de-facto choice for sequence modelling, yet their
quadratic self-attention and weak temporal bias can make long-range forecasting
both expensive and brittle. We introduce FreezeTST, a lightweight hybrid that
interleaves frozen random-feature (reservoir) blocks with standard trainable
Transformer layers. The frozen blocks endow the network with rich nonlinear
memory at no optimisation cost; the trainable layers learn to query this memory
through self-attention. The design cuts trainable parameters and also lowers
wall-clock training time, while leaving inference complexity unchanged. On
seven standard long-term forecasting benchmarks, FreezeTST consistently matches
or surpasses specialised variants such as Informer, Autoformer, and PatchTST;
with substantially lower compute. Our results show that embedding reservoir
principles within Transformers offers a simple, principled route to efficient
long-term time-series prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18130v1,,False
Provable Mixed-Noise Learning with Flow-Matching,25/08/2025,"Paul Hagemann, Robert Gruhlke, Bernhard Stankewitz, Claudia Schillings, Gabriele Steidl","We study Bayesian inverse problems with mixed noise, modeled as a combination
of additive and multiplicative Gaussian components. While traditional inference
methods often assume fixed or known noise characteristics, real-world
applications, particularly in physics and chemistry, frequently involve noise
with unknown and heterogeneous structure. Motivated by recent advances in
flow-based generative modeling, we propose a novel inference framework based on
conditional flow matching embedded within an Expectation-Maximization (EM)
algorithm to jointly estimate posterior samplers and noise parameters. To
enable high-dimensional inference and improve scalability, we use
simulation-free ODE-based flow matching as the generative model in the E-step
of the EM algorithm. We prove that, under suitable assumptions, the EM updates
converge to the true noise parameters in the population limit of infinite
observations. Our numerical results illustrate the effectiveness of combining
EM inference with flow matching for mixed-noise Bayesian inverse problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.18122v1,,False
Learning to Detect Label Errors by Making Them: A Method for Segmentation and Object Detection Datasets,25/08/2025,"Sarina Penquitt, Tobias Riedlinger, Timo Heller, Markus Reischl, Matthias Rottmann","Recently, detection of label errors and improvement of label quality in
datasets for supervised learning tasks has become an increasingly important
goal in both research and industry. The consequences of incorrectly annotated
data include reduced model performance, biased benchmark results, and lower
overall accuracy. Current state-of-the-art label error detection methods often
focus on a single computer vision task and, consequently, a specific type of
dataset, containing, for example, either bounding boxes or pixel-wise
annotations. Furthermore, previous methods are not learning-based. In this
work, we overcome this research gap. We present a unified method for detecting
label errors in object detection, semantic segmentation, and instance
segmentation datasets. In a nutshell, our approach - learning to detect label
errors by making them - works as follows: we inject different kinds of label
errors into the ground truth. Then, the detection of label errors, across all
mentioned primary tasks, is framed as an instance segmentation problem based on
a composite input. In our experiments, we compare the label error detection
performance of our method with various baselines and state-of-the-art
approaches of each task's domain on simulated label errors across multiple
tasks, datasets, and base models. This is complemented by a generalization
study on real-world label errors. Additionally, we release 459 real label
errors identified in the Cityscapes dataset and provide a benchmark for real
label error detection in Cityscapes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17930v1,,False
DiffusionGS: Generative Search with Query Conditioned Diffusion in Kuaishou,25/08/2025,"Qinyao Li, Xiaoyang Zheng, Qihang Zhao, Ke Xu, Zhongbo Sun, Chao Wang, Chenyi Lei, Han Li, Wenwu Ou","Personalized search ranking systems are critical for driving engagement and
revenue in modern e-commerce and short-video platforms. While existing methods
excel at estimating users' broad interests based on the filtered historical
behaviors, they typically under-exploit explicit alignment between a user's
real-time intent (represented by the user query) and their past actions. In
this paper, we propose DiffusionGS, a novel and scalable approach powered by
generative models. Our key insight is that user queries can serve as explicit
intent anchors to facilitate the extraction of users' immediate interests from
long-term, noisy historical behaviors. Specifically, we formulate interest
extraction as a conditional denoising task, where the user's query guides a
conditional diffusion process to produce a robust, user intent-aware
representation from their behavioral sequence. We propose the User-aware
Denoising Layer (UDL) to incorporate user-specific profiles into the
optimization of attention distribution on the user's past actions. By reframing
queries as intent priors and leveraging diffusion-based denoising, our method
provides a powerful mechanism for capturing dynamic user interest shifts.
Extensive offline and online experiments demonstrate the superiority of
DiffusionGS over state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17754v1,,False
Copyright Protection for 3D Molecular Structures with Watermarking,25/08/2025,"Runwen Hu, Peilin Chen, Keyan Ding, Shiqi Wang","Artificial intelligence (AI) revolutionizes molecule generation in
bioengineering and biological research, significantly accelerating discovery
processes. However, this advancement introduces critical concerns regarding
intellectual property protection. To address these challenges, we propose the
first robust watermarking method designed for molecules, which utilizes
atom-level features to preserve molecular integrity and invariant features to
ensure robustness against affine transformations. Comprehensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our method using the datasets QM9 and GEOM-DRUG,
and generative models GeoBFN and GeoLDM. We demonstrate the feasibility of
embedding watermarks, maintaining basic properties higher than 90.00\% while
achieving watermark accuracy greater than 95.00\%. Furthermore, downstream
docking simulations reveal comparable performance between original and
watermarked molecules, with binding affinities reaching -6.00 kcal/mol and root
mean square deviations below 1.602 \AA. These results confirm that our
watermarking technique effectively safeguards molecular intellectual property
without compromising scientific utility, enabling secure and responsible AI
integration in molecular discovery and research applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17702v1,,False
Characterizing the Behavior of Training Mamba-based State Space Models on GPUs,25/08/2025,"Trinayan Baruah, Kaustubh Shivdikar, Sara Prescott, David Kaeli","Mamba-based State Space Models (SSM) have emerged as a promising alternative
to the ubiquitous transformers. Despite the expressive power of transformers,
the quadratic complexity of computing attention is a major impediment to
scaling performance as we increase the sequence length. SSMs provide an
alternative path that addresses this problem, reducing the computational
complexity requirements of self-attention with novel model architectures for
different domains and fields such as video, text generation and graphs. Thus,
it is important to characterize the behavior of these emerging workloads on
GPUs and understand their requirements during GPU microarchitectural design. In
this work we evaluate Mamba-based SSMs and characterize their behavior during
training on GPUs. We construct a workload suite that offers representative
models that span different model architectures. We then use this suite to
analyze the architectural implications of running Mamba-based SSMs on GPUs. Our
work sheds new light on potential optimizations to continue scaling the
performance for such models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17679v1,,False
A Taxonomy of Transcendence,25/08/2025,"Natalie Abreu, Edwin Zhang, Eran Malach, Naomi Saphra","Although language models are trained to mimic humans, the resulting systems
display capabilities beyond the scope of any one person. To understand this
phenomenon, we use a controlled setting to identify properties of the training
data that lead a model to transcend the performance of its data sources. We
build on previous work to outline three modes of transcendence, which we call
skill denoising, skill selection, and skill generalization. We then introduce a
knowledge graph-based setting in which simulated experts generate data based on
their individual expertise. We highlight several aspects of data diversity that
help to enable the model's transcendent capabilities. Additionally, our data
generation setting offers a controlled testbed that we hope is valuable for
future research in the area.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17669v1,,False
Evaluating Movement Initiation Timing in Ultimate Frisbee via Temporal Counterfactuals,25/08/2025,"Shunsuke Iwashita, Ning Ding, Keisuke Fujii","Ultimate is a sport where points are scored by passing a disc and catching it
in the opposing team's end zone. In Ultimate, the player holding the disc
cannot move, making field dynamics primarily driven by other players'
movements. However, current literature in team sports has ignored quantitative
evaluations of when players initiate such unlabeled movements in game
situations. In this paper, we propose a quantitative evaluation method for
movement initiation timing in Ultimate Frisbee. First, game footage was
recorded using a drone camera, and players' positional data was obtained, which
will be published as UltimateTrack dataset. Next, players' movement initiations
were detected, and temporal counterfactual scenarios were generated by shifting
the timing of movements using rule-based approaches. These scenarios were
analyzed using a space evaluation metric based on soccer's pitch control
reflecting the unique rules of Ultimate. By comparing the spatial evaluation
values across scenarios, the difference between actual play and the most
favorable counterfactual scenario was used to quantitatively assess the impact
of movement timing.
  We validated our method and show that sequences in which the disc was
actually thrown to the receiver received higher evaluation scores than the
sequences without a throw.
  In practical verifications, the higher-skill group displays a broader
distribution of time offsets from the model's optimal initiation point.
  These findings demonstrate that the proposed metric provides an objective
means of assessing movement initiation timing, which has been difficult to
quantify in unlabeled team sport plays.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17611v1,,False
GWM: Towards Scalable Gaussian World Models for Robotic Manipulation,25/08/2025,"Guanxing Lu, Baoxiong Jia, Puhao Li, Yixin Chen, Ziwei Wang, Yansong Tang, Siyuan Huang","Training robot policies within a learned world model is trending due to the
inefficiency of real-world interactions. The established image-based world
models and policies have shown prior success, but lack robust geometric
information that requires consistent spatial and physical understanding of the
three-dimensional world, even pre-trained on internet-scale video sources. To
this end, we propose a novel branch of world model named Gaussian World Model
(GWM) for robotic manipulation, which reconstructs the future state by
inferring the propagation of Gaussian primitives under the effect of robot
actions. At its core is a latent Diffusion Transformer (DiT) combined with a 3D
variational autoencoder, enabling fine-grained scene-level future state
reconstruction with Gaussian Splatting. GWM can not only enhance the visual
representation for imitation learning agent by self-supervised future
prediction training, but can serve as a neural simulator that supports
model-based reinforcement learning. Both simulated and real-world experiments
depict that GWM can precisely predict future scenes conditioned on diverse
robot actions, and can be further utilized to train policies that outperform
the state-of-the-art by impressive margins, showcasing the initial data scaling
potential of 3D world model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.17600v1,,False

(i) MetaDSL: a compact, semantically rich domain-specific language that
captures diverse metamaterial designs in a form that is both human-readable and
machine-parsable. (ii) MetaDB: a curated repository of more than 150,000

capabilities of vision-language metamaterial assistants-structure
reconstruction, property-driven inverse design, and performance prediction. We
establish baselines by fine-tuning state-of-the-art vision-language models and
deploy an omni-model within an interactive, CAD-like interface. Case studies

Bridging Graph and State-Space Modeling for Intensive Care Unit Length of Stay Prediction,24/08/2025,"Shuqi Zi, Haitz Sáez de Ocáriz Borde, Emma Rocheteau, Pietro Lio'","Predicting a patient's length of stay (LOS) in the intensive care unit (ICU)
is a critical task for hospital resource management, yet remains challenging
due to the heterogeneous and irregularly sampled nature of electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we propose S$^2$G-Net, a novel neural
architecture that unifies state-space sequence modeling with multi-view Graph
Neural Networks (GNNs) for ICU LOS prediction. The temporal path employs Mamba
state-space models (SSMs) to capture patient trajectories, while the graph path
leverages an optimized GraphGPS backbone, designed to integrate heterogeneous
patient similarity graphs derived from diagnostic, administrative, and semantic

S$^2$G-Net consistently outperforms sequence models (BiLSTM, Mamba,
Transformer), graph models (classic GNNs, GraphGPS), and hybrid approaches
across all primary metrics. Extensive ablation studies and interpretability

LodeStar: Long-horizon Dexterity via Synthetic Data Augmentation from Human Demonstrations,24/08/2025,"Weikang Wan, Jiawei Fu, Xiaodi Yuan, Yifeng Zhu, Hao Su","Developing robotic systems capable of robustly executing long-horizon
manipulation tasks with human-level dexterity is challenging, as such tasks
require both physical dexterity and seamless sequencing of manipulation skills

a promising approach, acquiring comprehensive datasets is resource-intensive.
In this work, we propose a learning framework and system LodeStar that
automatically decomposes task demonstrations into semantically meaningful
skills using off-the-shelf foundation models, and generates diverse synthetic
demonstration datasets from a few human demos through reinforcement learning.
These sim-augmented datasets enable robust skill training, with a Skill Routing

A Synthetic Dataset for Manometry Recognition in Robotic Applications,24/08/2025,"Pedro Antonio Rabelo Saraiva, Enzo Ferreira de Souza, Joao Manoel Herrera Pinheiro, Thiago H. Segreto, Ricardo V. Godoy, Marcelo Becker","This work addresses the challenges of data scarcity and high acquisition
costs for training robust object detection models in complex industrial

barriers to collecting real-world data in these hazardous settings often hamper
the development of autonomous inspection systems. To overcome this, in this
work we propose and validate a hybrid data synthesis pipeline that combines

BlenderProc to create photorealistic images with precise annotations and
controlled domain randomization, and integrates NVIDIA's Cosmos-Predict2

Optimizing Grasping in Legged Robots: A Deep Learning Approach to Loco-Manipulation,24/08/2025,"Dilermando Almeida, Guilherme Lazzarini, Juliano Negri, Thiago H. Segreto, Ricardo V. Godoy, Marcelo Becker","Quadruped robots have emerged as highly efficient and versatile platforms,
excelling in navigating complex and unstructured terrains where traditional
wheeled robots might fail. Equipping these robots with manipulator arms unlocks
the advanced capability of loco-manipulation to perform complex physical
interaction tasks in areas ranging from industrial automation to
search-and-rescue missions. However, achieving precise and adaptable grasping
in such dynamic scenarios remains a significant challenge, often hindered by
the need for extensive real-world calibration and pre-programmed grasp
configurations. This paper introduces a deep learning framework designed to
enhance the grasping capabilities of quadrupeds equipped with arms, focusing on
improved precision and adaptability. Our approach centers on a sim-to-real
methodology that minimizes reliance on physical data collection. We developed a
pipeline within the Genesis simulation environment to generate a synthetic
dataset of grasp attempts on common objects. By simulating thousands of
interactions from various perspectives, we created pixel-wise annotated
grasp-quality maps to serve as the ground truth for our model. This dataset was
used to train a custom CNN with a U-Net-like architecture that processes
multi-modal input from an onboard RGB and depth cameras, including RGB images,
depth maps, segmentation masks, and surface normal maps. The trained model
outputs a grasp-quality heatmap to identify the optimal grasp point. We
validated the complete framework on a four-legged robot. The system
successfully executed a full loco-manipulation task: autonomously navigating to

fixed-length segment decoding, TreePO leverages local uncertainty to warrant
additional branches. By amortizing computation across common prefixes and
pruning low-value paths early, TreePO essentially reduces the per-update

Evolving Collective Cognition in Human-Agent Hybrid Societies: How Agents Form Stances and Boundaries,24/08/2025,"Hanzhong Zhang, Muhua Huang, Jindong Wang","Large language models have been widely used to simulate credible human social
behaviors. However, it remains unclear whether these models can demonstrate
stable capacities for stance formation and identity negotiation in complex
interactions, as well as how they respond to human interventions. We propose a
computational multi-agent society experiment framework that integrates
generative agent-based modeling with virtual ethnographic methods to
investigate how group stance differentiation and social boundary formation
emerge in human-agent hybrid societies. Across three studies, we find that
agents exhibit endogenous stances, independent of their preset identities, and
display distinct tonal preferences and response patterns to different discourse
strategies. Furthermore, through language interaction, agents actively
dismantle existing identity-based power structures and reconstruct
self-organized community boundaries based on these stances. Our findings
suggest that preset identities do not rigidly determine the agents' social
structures. For human researchers to effectively intervene in collective
cognition, attention must be paid to the endogenous mechanisms and
interactional dynamics within the agents' language networks. These insights
provide a theoretical foundation for using generative AI in modeling group

the rise of large language models (LLMs) provides new opportunities for
creating more accessible and scalable court simulations. While promising,
existing research mainly focuses on agent construction while ignoring the

we introduce and emphasize Cross-Modal Conflict Injection (CMCI), which embeds
subtle semantic contradictions between medical images and their paired reports.
These mismatches degrade retrieval and generation by disrupting cross-modal

Reinforcement Learning enhanced Online Adaptive Clinical Decision Support via Digital Twin powered Policy and Treatment Effect optimized Reward,24/08/2025,"Xinyu Qin, Ruiheng Yu, Lu Wang","Clinical decision support must adapt online under safety constraints. We
present an online adaptive tool where reinforcement learning provides the
policy, a patient digital twin provides the environment, and treatment effect
defines the reward. The system initializes a batch-constrained policy from
retrospective data and then runs a streaming loop that selects actions, checks
safety, and queries experts only when uncertainty is high. Uncertainty comes
from a compact ensemble of five Q-networks via the coefficient of variation of
action values with a $\tanh$ compression. The digital twin updates the patient
state with a bounded residual rule. The outcome model estimates immediate
clinical effect, and the reward is the treatment effect relative to a
conservative reference with a fixed z-score normalization from the training

Multi-Agent Visual-Language Reasoning for Comprehensive Highway Scene Understanding,24/08/2025,"Yunxiang Yang, Ningning Xu, Jidong J. Yang","This paper introduces a multi-agent framework for comprehensive highway scene
understanding, designed around a mixture-of-experts strategy. In this
framework, a large generic vision-language model (VLM), such as GPT-4o, is
contextualized with domain knowledge to generates task-specific
chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts. These fine-grained prompts are then used to
guide a smaller, efficient VLM (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) in reasoning over short
videos, along with complementary modalities as applicable. The framework
simultaneously addresses multiple critical perception tasks, including weather
classification, pavement wetness assessment, and traffic congestion detection,
achieving robust multi-task reasoning while balancing accuracy and
computational efficiency. To support empirical validation, we curated three
specialized datasets aligned with these tasks. Notably, the pavement wetness
dataset is multimodal, combining video streams with road weather sensor data,
highlighting the benefits of multimodal reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate consistently strong performance across diverse traffic and
environmental conditions. From a deployment perspective, the framework can be
readily integrated with existing traffic camera systems and strategically
applied to high-risk rural locations, such as sharp curves, flood-prone
lowlands, or icy bridges. By continuously monitoring the targeted sites, the
system enhances situational awareness and delivers timely alerts, even in

MoE-Beyond: Learning-Based Expert Activation Prediction on Edge Devices,23/08/2025,"Nishant Gavhane, Arush Mehrotra, Rohit Chawla, Peter Proenca","The deployment of large-scale Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models on edge devices

Traditional heuristic-based expert caching strategies such as MoE-Infinity

often requiring the model to process a large number of tokens. In this paper,
we present a scalable method that enables LLMs to access external knowledge

constrained generation with a pre-built prefix-tree index. Triples from a
Knowledge Graph are verbalized in textual facts, tokenized, and indexed in a
prefix tree for efficient access. During inference, to acquire external

Quantifying Out-of-Training Uncertainty of Neural-Network based Turbulence Closures,23/08/2025,"Cody Grogan, Som Dhulipala, Mauricio Tano, Izabela Gutowska, Som Dutta","Neural-Network (NN) based turbulence closures have been developed for being
used as pre-trained surrogates for traditional turbulence closures, with the
aim to increase computational efficiency and prediction accuracy of CFD
simulations. The bottleneck to the widespread adaptation of these ML-based
closures is the relative lack of uncertainty quantification (UQ) for these
models. Especially, quantifying uncertainties associated with out-of-training
inputs, that is when the ML-based turbulence closures are queried on inputs
outside their training data regime. In the current paper, a published algebraic
turbulence closure1 has been utilized to compare the quality of epistemic UQ
between three NN-based methods and Gaussian Process (GP). The three NN-based
methods explored are Deep Ensembles (DE), Monte-Carlo Dropout (MCD), and
Stochastic Variational Inference (SVI). In the in-training results, we find the
exact GP performs the best in accuracy with a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of
$2.14 \cdot 10^{-5}$ followed by the DE with an RMSE of $4.59 \cdot 10^{-4}$.
Next, the paper discusses the performance of the four methods for quantifying
out-of-training uncertainties. For performance, the Exact GP yet again is the
best in performance, but has similar performance to the DE in the
out-of-training regions. In UQ accuracy for the out-of-training case, SVI and
DE hold the best miscalibration error for one of the cases. However, the DE
performs the best in Negative Log-Likelihood for both out-of-training cases. We
observe that for the current problem, in terms of accuracy GP > DE > SV I >
MCD. The DE results are relatively robust and provide intuitive UQ estimates,

significantly higher than the NN-based methods with a $O(n^3)$ computational
complexity for each training step",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16891v1,,False

On Zero-Shot Reinforcement Learning,22/08/2025,Scott Jeen,"Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our

production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from
SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated
through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage,
context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while
a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation
quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and
semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use
and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes
in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale
production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced
contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the
present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16419v1,,False
Fast and Accurate RFIC Performance Prediction via Pin Level Graph Neural Networks and Probabilistic Flow,22/08/2025,"Anahita Asadi, Leonid Popryho, Inna Partin-Vaisband","Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16403v1,,False
Domain-aligned generative downscaling enhances projections of extreme climate events,22/08/2025,"Ruian Tie, Xiaohui Zhong, Zhengyu Shi, Hao Li, Jun Liu, Wu Libo","Climate change is exacerbating extreme weather events globally, including
high temperatures, extreme precipitation, strong winds, and tropical cyclones,
posing severe threats to human health, infrastructure, food security, and
socio-economic systems. Although existing global climate models (GCMs) provide
essential tools for climate prediction, they face limitations such as
insufficient resolution and high computational costs when simulating extreme
events. To address these issues, this study proposes a spatiotemporal
downscaling model based on generative machine learning-the Domain Aligned
Climate Downscaling model (DACD), designed to enhance the simulation
capabilities for extreme weather events. The proposed model employs domain
adaptation tricks and a Flow Matching training framework to transform global
low-resolution climate data into high-resolution local-scale climate
information while achieving precise simulation of multivariable and temporal
scales. The results show that during the historical period (2005-2014), our
model outperformed existing methods in simulating high temperatures, extreme
precipitation, strong wind, and tropical cyclone tracks, significantly reducing
errors and improving the ability to capture extreme events. Under different
future scenarios (2015-2100), the model reveals a significant increasing trend
in the frequency and intensity of extreme events, particularly under the
high-emission scenario (SSP585). Compared to traditional methods, our model
more accurately simulates the spatial distribution and dynamic changes of
extreme events, providing an essential tool for understanding the impacts of
climate change. This study offers a new technological pathway for
high-resolution climate analysis and extreme event prediction, providing
scientific support for addressing future climate change and formulating
adaptation strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16396v1,,False
Causal Beam Selection for Reliable Initial Access in AI-driven Beam Management,22/08/2025,"Nasir Khan, Asmaa Abdallah, Abdulkadir Celik, Ahmed M. Eltawil, Sinem Coleri","Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16352v1,,False
Uppaal Coshy: Automatic Synthesis of Compact Shields for Hybrid Systems,22/08/2025,"Asger Horn Brorholt, Andreas Holck Høeg-Petersen, Peter Gjøl Jensen, Kim Guldstrand Larsen, Marius Mikučionis, Christian Schilling, Andrzej Wąsowski","We present Uppaal Coshy, a tool for automatic synthesis of a safety strategy
-- or shield -- for Markov decision processes over continuous state spaces and
complex hybrid dynamics. The general methodology is to partition the state
space and then solve a two-player safety game, which entails a number of
algorithmically hard problems such as reachability for hybrid systems. The
general philosophy of Uppaal Coshy is to approximate hard-to-obtain solutions
using simulations. Our implementation is fully automatic and supports the
expressive formalism of Uppaal models, which encompass stochastic hybrid
automata. The precision of our partition-based approach benefits from using
finer grids, which however are not efficient to store. We include an algorithm
called Caap to efficiently compute a compact representation of a shield in the
form of a decision tree, which yields significant reductions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16345v1,,False
Unsupervised Online Detection of Pipe Blockages and Leakages in Water Distribution Networks,22/08/2025,"Jin Li, Kleanthis Malialis, Stelios G. Vrachimis, Marios M. Polycarpou","Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16336v1,,False
Representation Learning of Auxiliary Concepts for Improved Student Modeling and Exercise Recommendation,22/08/2025,"Yahya Badran, Christine Preisach","Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16269v1,,False
Graph RAG as Human Choice Model: Building a Data-Driven Mobility Agent with Preference Chain,22/08/2025,"Kai Hu, Parfait Atchade-Adelomou, Carlo Adornetto, Adrian Mora-Carrero, Luis Alonso-Pastor, Ariel Noyman, Yubo Liu, Kent Larson","Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16172v1,,False
Spacetime-GR: A Spacetime-Aware Generative Model for Large Scale Online POI Recommendation,22/08/2025,"Haitao Lin, Zhen Yang, Jiawei Xue, Ziji Zhang, Luzhu Wang, Yikun Gu, Yao Xu, Xin Li","Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16126v1,,False
Neural-Network Chemical Emulator for First-Star Formation: Robust Iterative Predictions over a Wide Density Range,22/08/2025,"Sojun Ono, Kazuyuki Sugimura","We present a neural-network emulator for the thermal and chemical evolution
in Population~III star formation. The emulator accurately reproduces the
thermochemical evolution over a wide density range spanning 21 orders of
magnitude (10$^{-3}$-10$^{18}$ cm$^{-3}$), tracking six primordial species: H,
H$_2$, e$^{-}$, H$^{+}$, H$^{-}$, and H$_2^{+}$. To handle the broad dynamic
range, we partition the density range into five subregions and train separate
deep operator networks (DeepONets) in each region. When applied to randomly
sampled thermochemical states, the emulator achieves relative errors below 10%
in over 90% of cases for both temperature and chemical abundances (except for
the rare species H$_2^{+}$). The emulator is roughly ten times faster on a CPU
and more than 1000 times faster for batched predictions on a GPU, compared with
conventional numerical integration. Furthermore, to ensure robust predictions
under many iterations, we introduce a novel timescale-based update method,
where a short-timestep update of each variable is computed by rescaling the
predicted change over a longer timestep equal to its characteristic variation
timescale. In one-zone collapse calculations, the results from the
timescale-based method agree well with traditional numerical integration even
with many iterations at a timestep as short as 10$^{-4}$ of the free-fall time.
This proof-of-concept study suggests the potential for neural network-based
chemical emulators to accelerate hydrodynamic simulations of star formation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16114v1,,False
Generative Foundation Model for Structured and Unstructured Electronic Health Records,22/08/2025,"Sonish Sivarajkumar, Hang Zhang, Yuelyu Ji, Maneesh Bilalpur, Xizhi Wu, Chenyu Li, Min Gu Kwak, Shyam Visweswaran, Yanshan Wang","Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16054v1,,False
Pareto Actor-Critic for Communication and Computation Co-Optimization in Non-Cooperative Federated Learning Services,22/08/2025,"Renxuan Tan, Rongpeng Li, Xiaoxue Yu, Xianfu Chen, Xing Xu, Zhifeng Zhao","Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.16037v1,,False
