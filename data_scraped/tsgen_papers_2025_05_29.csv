SimProcess: High Fidelity Simulation of Noisy ICS Physical Processes,28/05/2025,"Denis Donadel, Gabriele Crestanello, Giulio Morandini, Daniele Antonioli, Mauro Conti, Massimo Merro","Industrial Control Systems (ICS) manage critical infrastructures like power
grids and water treatment plants. Cyberattacks on ICSs can disrupt operations,
causing severe economic, environmental, and safety issues. For example,
undetected pollution in a water plant can put the lives of thousands at stake.
ICS researchers have increasingly turned to honeypots -- decoy systems designed
to attract attackers, study their behaviors, and eventually improve defensive
mechanisms. However, existing ICS honeypots struggle to replicate the ICS
physical process, making them susceptible to detection. Accurately simulating
the noise in ICS physical processes is challenging because different factors
produce it, including sensor imperfections and external interferences.
  In this paper, we propose SimProcess, a novel framework to rank the fidelity
of ICS simulations by evaluating how closely they resemble real-world and noisy
physical processes. It measures the simulation distance from a target system by
estimating the noise distribution with machine learning models like Random
Forest. Unlike existing solutions that require detailed mathematical models or
are limited to simple systems, SimProcess operates with only a timeseries of
measurements from the real system, making it applicable to a broader range of
complex dynamic systems. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness through a
case study using real-world power grid data from the EPIC testbed. We compare
the performance of various simulation methods, including static and generative
noise techniques. Our model correctly classifies real samples with a recall of
up to 1.0. It also identifies Gaussian and Gaussian Mixture as the best
distribution to simulate our power systems, together with a generative solution
provided by an autoencoder, thereby helping developers to improve honeypot
fidelity. Additionally, we make our code publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22638v1,10.1145/3709017.3737711,False
GLAMP: An Approximate Message Passing Framework for Transfer Learning with Applications to Lasso-based Estimators,28/05/2025,"Longlin Wang, Yanke Song, Kuanhao Jiang, Pragya Sur","Approximate Message Passing (AMP) algorithms enable precise characterization
of certain classes of random objects in the high-dimensional limit, and have
found widespread applications in fields such as statistics, deep learning,
genetics, and communications. However, existing AMP frameworks cannot
simultaneously handle matrix-valued iterates and non-separable denoising
functions. This limitation prevents them from precisely characterizing
estimators that draw information from multiple data sources with distribution
shifts. In this work, we introduce Generalized Long Approximate Message Passing
(GLAMP), a novel extension of AMP that addresses this limitation. We rigorously
prove state evolution for GLAMP. GLAMP significantly broadens the scope of AMP,
enabling the analysis of transfer learning estimators that were previously out
of reach. We demonstrate the utility of GLAMP by precisely characterizing the
risk of three Lasso-based transfer learning estimators: the Stacked Lasso, the
Model Averaging Estimator, and the Second Step Estimator. We also demonstrate
the remarkable finite sample accuracy of our theory via extensive simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22594v1,,False
IGNIS: A Neural Network Framework for Robust Parameter Estimation in Archimedean Copulas,28/05/2025,"Agnideep Aich, Ashit Baran Aich, Bruce Wade","Parameter estimation for Archimedean copulas remains a challenging problem,
particularly for the recently developed A1 and A2 families that exhibit complex
dependency structures. Traditional methods, such as the Method of Moments
(MoM), Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Maximum Pseudo-Likelihood
(MPL), often struggle due to issues of non-monotonic relationship with
dependency measures such as Kendall's tau (as in the case of A1) and numerical
instability. In this paper, we present the IGNIS Network, a novel, unified
neural framework that learns a direct mapping from observable dependency
measures to copula parameters, thereby overcoming the limitations of classical
approaches. Our approach is trained on simulated data spanning five Archimedean
copula families including Clayton, Gumbel, Frank, A1, and A2, ensuring its
general applicability across the entire family. Extensive simulation studies
demonstrate that the IGNIS Network reduces estimation errors compared to MoM,
while inherently enforcing parameter constraints through theory-guided
post-processing. We further validate the practical utility of our method on
diverse real-world datasets, including financial returns (AAPL-MSFT),
healthcare metrics (CDC Diabetes indicators), and environmental measurements
(PM2.5 air quality). Our results underscore the transformative potential of
neural methods for robust and accurate dependence modeling in modern
applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22518v1,,False
ProSpero: Active Learning for Robust Protein Design Beyond Wild-Type Neighborhoods,28/05/2025,"Michal Kmicikiewicz, Vincent Fortuin, Ewa Szczurek","Designing protein sequences of both high fitness and novelty is a challenging
task in data-efficient protein engineering. Exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods often leads to biologically implausible sequences or relies on
surrogate models that lose fidelity in novel regions. Here, we propose
ProSpero, an active learning framework in which a frozen pre-trained generative
model is guided by a surrogate updated from oracle feedback. By integrating
fitness-relevant residue selection with biologically-constrained Sequential
Monte Carlo sampling, our approach enables exploration beyond wild-type
neighborhoods while preserving biological plausibility. We show that our
framework remains effective even when the surrogate is misspecified. ProSpero
consistently outperforms or matches existing methods across diverse protein
engineering tasks, retrieving sequences of both high fitness and novelty.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22494v1,,False
Pure Exploration with Infinite Answers,28/05/2025,"Riccardo Poiani, Martino Bernasconi, Andrea Celli","We study pure exploration problems where the set of correct answers is
possibly infinite, e.g., the regression of any continuous function of the means
of the bandit. We derive an instance-dependent lower bound for these problems.
By analyzing it, we discuss why existing methods (i.e., Sticky Track-and-Stop)
for finite answer problems fail at being asymptotically optimal in this more
general setting. Finally, we present a framework, Sticky-Sequence
Track-and-Stop, which generalizes both Track-and-Stop and Sticky
Track-and-Stop, and that enjoys asymptotic optimality. Due to its generality,
our analysis also highlights special cases where existing methods enjoy
optimality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22473v1,,False
SOReL and TOReL: Two Methods for Fully Offline Reinforcement Learning,28/05/2025,"Mattie Fellows, Clarisse Wibault, Uljad Berdica, Johannes Forkel, Jakob N. Foerster, Michael A. Osborne","Sample efficiency remains a major obstacle for real world adoption of
reinforcement learning (RL): success has been limited to settings where
simulators provide access to essentially unlimited environment interactions,
which in reality are typically costly or dangerous to obtain. Offline RL in
principle offers a solution by exploiting offline data to learn a near-optimal
policy before deployment. In practice, however, current offline RL methods rely
on extensive online interactions for hyperparameter tuning, and have no
reliable bound on their initial online performance. To address these two
issues, we introduce two algorithms. Firstly, SOReL: an algorithm for safe
offline reinforcement learning. Using only offline data, our Bayesian approach
infers a posterior over environment dynamics to obtain a reliable estimate of
the online performance via the posterior predictive uncertainty. Crucially, all
hyperparameters are also tuned fully offline. Secondly, we introduce TOReL: a
tuning for offline reinforcement learning algorithm that extends our
information rate based offline hyperparameter tuning methods to general offline
RL approaches. Our empirical evaluation confirms SOReL's ability to accurately
estimate regret in the Bayesian setting whilst TOReL's offline hyperparameter
tuning achieves competitive performance with the best online hyperparameter
tuning methods using only offline data. Thus, SOReL and TOReL make a
significant step towards safe and reliable offline RL, unlocking the potential
for RL in the real world. Our implementations are publicly available:

Data-Driven Antenna Miniaturization: A Knowledge-Based System Integrating Quantum PSO and Predictive Machine Learning Models,28/05/2025,"Khan Masood Parvez, Sk Md Abidar Rahaman, Ali Shiri Sichani","The rapid evolution of wireless technologies necessitates automated design
frameworks to address antenna miniaturization and performance optimization
within constrained development cycles. This study demonstrates a machine
learning enhanced workflow integrating Quantum-Behaved Dynamic Particle Swarm
Optimization (QDPSO) with ANSYS HFSS simulations to accelerate antenna design.
The QDPSO algorithm autonomously optimized loop dimensions in 11.53 seconds,
achieving a resonance frequency of 1.4208 GHz a 12.7 percent reduction compared
to conventional 1.60 GHz designs. Machine learning models (SVM, Random Forest,
XGBoost, and Stacked ensembles) predicted resonance frequencies in 0.75 seconds
using 936 simulation datasets, with stacked models showing superior training
accuracy (R2=0.9825) and SVM demonstrating optimal validation performance
(R2=0.7197). The complete design cycle, encompassing optimization, prediction,
and ANSYS validation, required 12.42 minutes on standard desktop hardware
(Intel i5-8500, 16GB RAM), contrasting sharply with the 50-hour benchmark of
PSADEA-based approaches. This 240 times of acceleration eliminates traditional
trial-and-error methods that often extend beyond seven expert-led days. The
system enables precise specifications of performance targets with automated
generation of fabrication-ready parameters, particularly benefiting compact
consumer devices requiring rapid frequency tuning. By bridging AI-driven
optimization with CAD validation, this framework reduces engineering workloads
while ensuring production-ready designs, establishing a scalable paradigm for
next-generation RF systems in 6G and IoT applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22440v1,,False
A Divide-and-Conquer Approach for Modeling Arrival Times in Business Process Simulation,28/05/2025,"Lukas Kirchdorfer, Konrad Özdemir, Stjepan Kusenic, Han van der Aa, Heiner Stuckenschmidt","Business Process Simulation (BPS) is a critical tool for analyzing and
improving organizational processes by estimating the impact of process changes.
A key component of BPS is the case-arrival model, which determines the pattern
of new case entries into a process. Although accurate case-arrival modeling is
essential for reliable simulations, as it influences waiting and overall cycle
times, existing approaches often rely on oversimplified static distributions of
inter-arrival times. These approaches fail to capture the dynamic and temporal
complexities inherent in organizational environments, leading to less accurate
and reliable outcomes. To address this limitation, we propose Auto Time Kernel
Density Estimation (AT-KDE), a divide-and-conquer approach that models arrival
times of processes by incorporating global dynamics, day-of-week variations,
and intraday distributional changes, ensuring both precision and scalability.
Experiments conducted across 20 diverse processes demonstrate that AT-KDE is
far more accurate and robust than existing approaches while maintaining
sensible execution time efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22381v1,,False
Rethinking BPS: A Utility-Based Evaluation Framework,28/05/2025,"Konrad Özdemir, Lukas Kirchdorfer, Keyvan Amiri Elyasi, Han van der Aa, Heiner Stuckenschmidt","Business process simulation (BPS) is a key tool for analyzing and optimizing
organizational workflows, supporting decision-making by estimating the impact
of process changes. The reliability of such estimates depends on the ability of
a BPS model to accurately mimic the process under analysis, making rigorous
accuracy evaluation essential. However, the state-of-the-art approach to
evaluating BPS models has two key limitations. First, it treats simulation as a
forecasting problem, testing whether models can predict unseen future events.
This fails to assess how well a model captures the as-is process, particularly
when process behavior changes from train to test period. Thus, it becomes
difficult to determine whether poor results stem from an inaccurate model or
the inherent complexity of the data, such as unpredictable drift. Second, the
evaluation approach strongly relies on Earth Mover's Distance-based metrics,
which can obscure temporal patterns and thus yield misleading conclusions about
simulation quality. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework that
evaluates simulation quality based on its ability to generate representative
process behavior. Instead of comparing simulated logs to future real-world
executions, we evaluate whether predictive process monitoring models trained on
simulated data perform comparably to those trained on real data for downstream
analysis tasks. Empirical results show that our framework not only helps
identify sources of discrepancies but also distinguishes between model accuracy
and data complexity, offering a more meaningful way to assess BPS quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22316v1,,False
Neural Restoration of Greening Defects in Historical Autochrome Photographs Based on Purely Synthetic Data,28/05/2025,"Saptarshi Neil Sinha, P. Julius Kuehn, Johannes Koppe, Arjan Kuijper, Michael Weinmann","The preservation of early visual arts, particularly color photographs, is
challenged by deterioration caused by aging and improper storage, leading to
issues like blurring, scratches, color bleeding, and fading defects. In this
paper, we present the first approach for the automatic removal of greening
color defects in digitized autochrome photographs. Our main contributions
include a method based on synthetic dataset generation and the use of
generative AI with a carefully designed loss function for the restoration of
visual arts. To address the lack of suitable training datasets for analyzing
greening defects in damaged autochromes, we introduce a novel approach for
accurately simulating such defects in synthetic data. We also propose a
modified weighted loss function for the ChaIR method to account for color
imbalances between defected and non-defected areas. While existing methods
struggle with accurately reproducing original colors and may require
significant manual effort, our method allows for efficient restoration with
reduced time requirements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22291v1,,False
Full Domain Analysis in Fluid Dynamics,28/05/2025,"Alexander Hagg, Adam Gaier, Dominik Wilde, Alexander Asteroth, Holger Foysi, Dirk Reith","Novel techniques in evolutionary optimization, simulation and machine
learning allow for a broad analysis of domains like fluid dynamics, in which
computation is expensive and flow behavior is complex. Under the term of full
domain analysis we understand the ability to efficiently determine the full
space of solutions in a problem domain, and analyze the behavior of those
solutions in an accessible and interactive manner. The goal of full domain
analysis is to deepen our understanding of domains by generating many examples
of flow, their diversification, optimization and analysis. We define a formal
model for full domain analysis, its current state of the art, and requirements
of subcomponents. Finally, an example is given to show what we can learn by
using full domain analysis. Full domain analysis, rooted in optimization and
machine learning, can be a helpful tool in understanding complex systems in
computational physics and beyond.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22275v1,,False
UDuo: Universal Dual Optimization Framework for Online Matching,28/05/2025,"Bin Li, Diwei Liu, Zehong Hu, Jia Jia","Online resource allocation under budget constraints critically depends on
proper modeling of user arrival dynamics. Classical approaches employ
stochastic user arrival models to derive near-optimal solutions through
fractional matching formulations of exposed users for downstream allocation
tasks. However, this is no longer a reasonable assumption when the environment
changes dynamically. In this work, We propose the Universal Dual optimization
framework UDuo, a novel paradigm that fundamentally rethinks online allocation
through three key innovations: (i) a temporal user arrival representation
vector that explicitly captures distribution shifts in user arrival patterns
and resource consumption dynamics, (ii) a resource pacing learner with adaptive
allocation policies that generalize to heterogeneous constraint scenarios, and
(iii) an online time-series forecasting approach for future user arrival
distributions that achieves asymptotically optimal solutions with constraint
feasibility guarantees in dynamic environments. Experimental results show that
UDuo achieves higher efficiency and faster convergence than the traditional
stochastic arrival model in real-world pricing while maintaining rigorous
theoretical validity for general online allocation problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22243v1,,False
Yambda-5B -- A Large-Scale Multi-modal Dataset for Ranking And Retrieval,28/05/2025,"A. Ploshkin, V. Tytskiy, A. Pismenny, V. Baikalov, E. Taychinov, A. Permiakov, D. Burlakov, E. Krofto, N. Savushkin","We present Yambda-5B, a large-scale open dataset sourced from the
Yandex.Music streaming platform. Yambda-5B contains 4.79 billion user-item
interactions from 1 million users across 9.39 million tracks. The dataset
includes two primary types of interactions: implicit feedback (listening
events) and explicit feedback (likes, dislikes, unlikes and undislikes). In
addition, we provide audio embeddings for most tracks, generated by a
convolutional neural network trained on audio spectrograms. A key
distinguishing feature of Yambda-5B is the inclusion of the is_organic flag,
which separates organic user actions from recommendation-driven events. This
distinction is critical for developing and evaluating machine learning
algorithms, as Yandex.Music relies on recommender systems to personalize track
selection for users. To support rigorous benchmarking, we introduce an
evaluation protocol based on a Global Temporal Split, allowing recommendation
algorithms to be assessed in conditions that closely mirror real-world use. We
report benchmark results for standard baselines (ItemKNN, iALS) and advanced

Let's Predict Sentence by Sentence,28/05/2025,"Hyeonbin Hwang, Byeongguk Jeon, Seungone Kim, Jiyeon Kim, Hoyeon Chang, Sohee Yang, Seungpil Won, Dohaeng Lee, Youbin Ahn, Minjoon Seo","Autoregressive language models (LMs) generate one token at a time, yet human
reasoning operates over higher-level abstractions - sentences, propositions,
and concepts. This contrast raises a central question- Can LMs likewise learn
to reason over structured semantic units rather than raw token sequences? In
this work, we investigate whether pretrained LMs can be lifted into such
abstract reasoning spaces by building on their learned representations. We
present a framework that adapts a pretrained token-level LM to operate in
sentence space by autoregressively predicting continuous embeddings of next
sentences. We explore two embedding paradigms inspired by classical
representation learning: 1) semantic embeddings, learned via autoencoding to
preserve surface meaning; and 2) contextual embeddings, trained via
next-sentence prediction to encode anticipatory structure. We evaluate both
under two inference regimes: Discretized, which decodes each predicted
embedding into text before re-encoding; and Continuous, which reasons entirely
in embedding space for improved efficiency. Across four domains - mathematics,
logic, commonsense, and planning - contextual embeddings under continuous
inference show competitive performance with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) while
reducing inference-time FLOPs on average by half. We also present early signs
of scalability and modular adaptation. Finally, to visualize latent
trajectories, we introduce SentenceLens, a diagnostic tool that decodes
intermediate model states into interpretable sentences. Together, our results
indicate that pretrained LMs can effectively transition to abstract, structured
reasoning within latent embedding spaces.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22202v1,,False
Sentiment Simulation using Generative AI Agents,28/05/2025,"Melrose Tia, Jezreel Sophia Lanuzo, Lei Rigi Baltazar, Marie Joy Lopez-Relente, Diwa Malaya Quiñones, Jason Albia","Traditional sentiment analysis relies on surface-level linguistic patterns
and retrospective data, limiting its ability to capture the psychological and
contextual drivers of human sentiment. These limitations constrain its
effectiveness in applications that require predictive insight, such as policy
testing, narrative framing, and behavioral forecasting. We present a robust
framework for sentiment simulation using generative AI agents embedded with
psychologically rich profiles. Agents are instantiated from a nationally
representative survey of 2,485 Filipino respondents, combining sociodemographic
information with validated constructs of personality traits, values, beliefs,
and socio-political attitudes. The framework includes three stages: (1) agent
embodiment via categorical or contextualized encodings, (2) exposure to
real-world political and economic scenarios, and (3) generation of sentiment
ratings accompanied by explanatory rationales. Using Quadratic Weighted
Accuracy (QWA), we evaluated alignment between agent-generated and human
responses. Contextualized encoding achieved 92% alignment in replicating
original survey responses. In sentiment simulation tasks, agents reached
81%--86% accuracy against ground truth sentiment, with contextualized profile
encodings significantly outperforming categorical (p < 0.0001, Cohen's d =
0.70). Simulation results remained consistent across repeated trials
(+/-0.2--0.5% SD) and resilient to variation in scenario framing (p = 0.9676,
Cohen's d = 0.02). Our findings establish a scalable framework for sentiment
modeling through psychographically grounded AI agents. This work signals a
paradigm shift in sentiment analysis from retrospective classification to
prospective and dynamic simulation grounded in psychology of sentiment

Multimodal Forecasting of Sparse Intraoperative Hypotension Events Powered by Language Model,28/05/2025,"Jintao Zhang, Zirui Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Shilong Zhang, Tingyue Pan, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie","Intraoperative hypotension (IOH) frequently occurs under general anesthesia
and is strongly linked to adverse outcomes such as myocardial injury and
increased mortality. Despite its significance, IOH prediction is hindered by
event sparsity and the challenge of integrating static and dynamic data across
diverse patients. In this paper, we propose \textbf{IOHFuseLM}, a multimodal
language model framework. To accurately identify and differentiate sparse
hypotensive events, we leverage a two-stage training strategy. The first stage
involves domain adaptive pretraining on IOH physiological time series augmented
through diffusion methods, thereby enhancing the model sensitivity to patterns
associated with hypotension. Subsequently, task fine-tuning is performed on the
original clinical dataset to further enhance the ability to distinguish
normotensive from hypotensive states. To enable multimodal fusion for each
patient, we align structured clinical descriptions with the corresponding
physiological time series at the token level. Such alignment enables the model
to capture individualized temporal patterns alongside their corresponding
clinical semantics. In addition, we convert static patient attributes into
structured text to enrich personalized information. Experimental evaluations on
two intraoperative datasets demonstrate that IOHFuseLM outperforms established
baselines in accurately identifying IOH events, highlighting its applicability
in clinical decision support scenarios. Our code is publicly available to

Transport-inspired loss that compares the original and reconstructed graphs and
leverages a differentiable node matching module, which is trained jointly with
the encoder and decoder. The proposed attention-based architecture relies on
Evoformer, the core component of AlphaFold, which we extend to support both

Curse of High Dimensionality Issue in Transformer for Long-context Modeling,28/05/2025,"Shuhai Zhang, Zeng You, Yaofo Chen, Zhiquan Wen, Qianyue Wang, Zhijie Qiu, Yuanqing Li, Mingkui Tan","Transformer-based large language models (LLMs) excel in natural language
processing tasks by capturing long-range dependencies through self-attention
mechanisms. However, long-context modeling faces significant computational
inefficiencies due to \textit{redundant} attention computations: while
attention weights are often \textit{sparse}, all tokens consume \textit{equal}
computational resources. In this paper, we reformulate traditional
probabilistic sequence modeling as a \textit{supervised learning task},
enabling the separation of relevant and irrelevant tokens and providing a
clearer understanding of redundancy. Based on this reformulation, we
theoretically analyze attention sparsity, revealing that only a few tokens
significantly contribute to predictions. Building on this, we formulate
attention optimization as a linear coding problem and propose a \textit{group
coding strategy}, theoretically showing its ability to improve robustness
against random noise and enhance learning efficiency. Motivated by this, we
propose \textit{Dynamic Group Attention} (DGA), which leverages the group

High Volume Rate 3D Ultrasound Reconstruction with Diffusion Models,28/05/2025,"Tristan S. W. Stevens, Oisín Nolan, Oudom Somphone, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J. G. van Sloun","Three-dimensional ultrasound enables real-time volumetric visualization of
anatomical structures. Unlike traditional 2D ultrasound, 3D imaging reduces the
reliance on precise probe orientation, potentially making ultrasound more
accessible to clinicians with varying levels of experience and improving
automated measurements and post-exam analysis. However, achieving both high
volume rates and high image quality remains a significant challenge. While 3D
diverging waves can provide high volume rates, they suffer from limited tissue
harmonic generation and increased multipath effects, which degrade image
quality. One compromise is to retain the focusing in elevation while leveraging
unfocused diverging waves in the lateral direction to reduce the number of
transmissions per elevation plane. Reaching the volume rates achieved by full
3D diverging waves, however, requires dramatically undersampling the number of
elevation planes. Subsequently, to render the full volume, simple interpolation
techniques are applied. This paper introduces a novel approach to 3D ultrasound
reconstruction from a reduced set of elevation planes by employing diffusion
models (DMs) to achieve increased spatial and temporal resolution. We compare
both traditional and supervised deep learning-based interpolation methods on a
3D cardiac ultrasound dataset. Our results show that DM-based reconstruction
consistently outperforms the baselines in image quality and downstream task
performance. Additionally, we accelerate inference by leveraging the temporal
consistency inherent to ultrasound sequences. Finally, we explore the
robustness of the proposed method by exploiting the probabilistic nature of
diffusion posterior sampling to quantify reconstruction uncertainty and
demonstrate improved recall on out-of-distribution data with synthetic
anomalies under strong subsampling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22090v1,,False
Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz,28/05/2025,H. L. Dao,"In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum
state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of
approximating the ground state wavefunction for quantum many-body systems. In
particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both
conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical
settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM)
of up to 100 spins and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$
systems of up 50 spins. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments
performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or
better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these
settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of
hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum
many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a
clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ &
$J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor
interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its
Euclidean version in all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent
of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU
almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a
tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU
NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin
systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions.
Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of
non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22083v1,,False

MapStory: LLM-Powered Text-Driven Map Animation Prototyping with Human-in-the-Loop Editing,28/05/2025,"Aditya Gunturu, Ben Pearman, Keiichi Ihara, Morteza Faraji, Bryan Wang, Rubaiat Habib Kazi, Ryo Suzuki","We introduce MapStory, an LLM-powered animation authoring tool that generates
editable map animation sequences directly from natural language text. Given a
user-written script, MapStory leverages an agentic architecture to
automatically produce a scene breakdown, which decomposes the script into key
animation building blocks such as camera movements, visual highlights, and
animated elements. Our system includes a researcher component that accurately
queries geospatial information by leveraging an LLM with web search, enabling
the automatic extraction of relevant regions, paths, and coordinates while
allowing users to edit and query for changes or additional information to
refine the results. Additionally, users can fine-tune parameters of these
blocks through an interactive timeline editor. We detail the system's design
and architecture, informed by formative interviews with professional animators
and an analysis of 200 existing map animation videos. Our evaluation, which
includes expert interviews (N=5) and a usability study (N=12), demonstrates
that MapStory enables users to create map animations with ease, facilitates
faster iteration, encourages creative exploration, and lowers barriers to
creating map-centric stories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21966v1,,False
Higher-Order Group Synchronization,28/05/2025,"Adriana L. Duncan, Joe Kileel","Group synchronization is the problem of determining reliable global estimates
from noisy local measurements on networks. The typical task for group
synchronization is to assign elements of a group to the nodes of a graph in a
way that respects group elements given on the edges which encode information
about local pairwise relationships between the nodes. In this paper, we
introduce a novel higher-order group synchronization problem which operates on
a hypergraph and seeks to synchronize higher-order local measurements on the
hyperedges to obtain global estimates on the nodes. Higher-order group
synchronization is motivated by applications to computer vision and image
processing, among other computational problems. First, we define the problem of
higher-order group synchronization and discuss its mathematical foundations.
Specifically, we give necessary and sufficient synchronizability conditions
which establish the importance of cycle consistency in higher-order group
synchronization. Then, we propose the first computational framework for general
higher-order group synchronization; it acts globally and directly on
higher-order measurements using a message passing algorithm. We discuss
theoretical guarantees for our framework, including convergence analyses under
outliers and noise. Finally, we show potential advantages of our method through
numerical experiments. In particular, we show that in certain cases our
higher-order method applied to rotational and angular synchronization
outperforms standard pairwise synchronization methods and is more robust to
outliers. We also show that our method has comparable performance on simulated
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) data compared to a standard cryo-EM
reconstruction package.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21932v1,,False
FALCON: An ML Framework for Fully Automated Layout-Constrained Analog Circuit Design,28/05/2025,"Asal Mehradfar, Xuzhe Zhao, Yilun Huang, Emir Ceyani, Yankai Yang, Shihao Han, Hamidreza Aghasi, Salman Avestimehr","Designing analog circuits from performance specifications is a complex,
multi-stage process encompassing topology selection, parameter inference, and
layout feasibility. We introduce FALCON, a unified machine learning framework
that enables fully automated, specification-driven analog circuit synthesis
through topology selection and layout-constrained optimization. Given a target
performance, FALCON first selects an appropriate circuit topology using a
performance-driven classifier guided by human design heuristics. Next, it
employs a custom, edge-centric graph neural network trained to map circuit
topology and parameters to performance, enabling gradient-based parameter
inference through the learned forward model. This inference is guided by a
differentiable layout cost, derived from analytical equations capturing
parasitic and frequency-dependent effects, and constrained by design rules. We
train and evaluate FALCON on a large-scale custom dataset of 1M analog mm-wave
circuits, generated and simulated using Cadence Spectre across 20
expert-designed topologies. Through this evaluation, FALCON demonstrates >99\%
accuracy in topology inference, <10\% relative error in performance prediction,
and efficient layout-aware design that completes in under 1 second per
instance. Together, these results position FALCON as a practical and extensible
foundation model for end-to-end analog circuit design automation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21923v1,,False
Almost Linear Convergence under Minimal Score Assumptions: Quantized Transition Diffusion,28/05/2025,"Xunpeng Huang, Yingyu Lin, Nikki Lijing Kuang, Hanze Dong, Difan Zou, Yian Ma, Tong Zhang","Continuous diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable performance in data
generation across various domains, yet their efficiency remains constrained by
two critical limitations: (1) the local adjacency structure of the forward
Markov process, which restricts long-range transitions in the data space, and
(2) inherent biases introduced during the simulation of time-inhomogeneous
reverse denoising processes. To address these challenges, we propose Quantized
Transition Diffusion (QTD), a novel approach that integrates data quantization
with discrete diffusion dynamics. Our method first transforms the continuous
data distribution $p_*$ into a discrete one $q_*$ via histogram approximation
and binary encoding, enabling efficient representation in a structured discrete
latent space. We then design a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with Hamming
distance-based transitions as the forward process, which inherently supports
long-range movements in the original data space. For reverse-time sampling, we
introduce a \textit{truncated uniformization} technique to simulate the reverse
CTMC, which can provably provide unbiased generation from $q_*$ under minimal
score assumptions. Through a novel KL dynamic analysis of the reverse CTMC, we
prove that QTD can generate samples with $O(d\ln^2(d/\epsilon))$ score
evaluations in expectation to approximate the $d$--dimensional target
distribution $p_*$ within an $\epsilon$ error tolerance. Our method not only
establishes state-of-the-art inference efficiency but also advances the
theoretical foundations of diffusion-based generative modeling by unifying
discrete and continuous diffusion paradigms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21892v1,,False
SVRPBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Stochastic Vehicle Routing Problem,28/05/2025,"Ahmed Heakl, Yahia Salaheldin Shaaban, Martin Takac, Salem Lahlou, Zangir Iklassov","Robust routing under uncertainty is central to real-world logistics, yet most
benchmarks assume static, idealized settings. We present SVRPBench, the first
open benchmark to capture high-fidelity stochastic dynamics in vehicle routing
at urban scale. Spanning more than 500 instances with up to 1000 customers, it
simulates realistic delivery conditions: time-dependent congestion, log-normal
delays, probabilistic accidents, and empirically grounded time windows for
residential and commercial clients. Our pipeline generates diverse,
constraint-rich scenarios, including multi-depot and multi-vehicle setups.
Benchmarking reveals that state-of-the-art RL solvers like POMO and AM degrade
by over 20% under distributional shift, while classical and metaheuristic
methods remain robust. To enable reproducible research, we release the dataset
and evaluation suite. SVRPBench challenges the community to design solvers that
generalize beyond synthetic assumptions and adapt to real-world uncertainty.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21887v1,,False
Incorporating LLMs for Large-Scale Urban Complex Mobility Simulation,28/05/2025,"Yu-Lun Song, Chung-En Tsern, Che-Cheng Wu, Yu-Ming Chang, Syuan-Bo Huang, Wei-Chu Chen, Michael Chia-Liang Lin, Yu-Ta Lin","This study presents an innovative approach to urban mobility simulation by
integrating a Large Language Model (LLM) with Agent-Based Modeling (ABM).

enhance agent diversity and realism by generating synthetic population
profiles, allocating routine and occasional locations, and simulating
personalized routes. Using real-world data, the simulation models individual

A Physics-Informed Learning Framework to Solve the Infinite-Horizon Optimal Control Problem,28/05/2025,"Filippos Fotiadis, Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis","We propose a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) framework to solve the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem of nonlinear systems. In particular,
since PINNs are generally able to solve a class of partial differential
equations (PDEs), they can be employed to learn the value function of the
infinite-horizon optimal control problem via solving the associated
steady-state Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation. However, an issue here is
that the steady-state HJB equation generally yields multiple solutions; hence
if PINNs are directly employed to it, they may end up approximating a solution
that is different from the optimal value function of the problem. We tackle
this by instead applying PINNs to a finite-horizon variant of the steady-state
HJB that has a unique solution, and which uniformly approximates the optimal
value function as the horizon increases. An algorithm to verify if the chosen
horizon is large enough is also given, as well as a method to extend it -- with
reduced computations and robustness to approximation errors -- in case it is
not. Unlike many existing methods, the proposed technique works well with
non-polynomial basis functions, does not require prior knowledge of a
stabilizing controller, and does not perform iterative policy evaluations.
Simulations are performed, which verify and clarify theoretical findings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.21842v1,,False
