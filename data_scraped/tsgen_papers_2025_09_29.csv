"See, Point, Fly: A Learning-Free VLM Framework for Universal Unmanned Aerial Navigation",26/09/2025,"Chih Yao Hu, Yang-Sen Lin, Yuna Lee, Chih-Hai Su, Jie-Ying Lee, Shr-Ruei Tsai, Chin-Yang Lin, Kuan-Wen Chen, Tsung-Wei Ke, Yu-Lun Liu","We present See, Point, Fly (SPF), a training-free aerial vision-and-language
navigation (AVLN) framework built atop vision-language models (VLMs). SPF is
capable of navigating to any goal based on any type of free-form instructions
in any kind of environment. In contrast to existing VLM-based approaches that
treat action prediction as a text generation task, our key insight is to
consider action prediction for AVLN as a 2D spatial grounding task. SPF
harnesses VLMs to decompose vague language instructions into iterative
annotation of 2D waypoints on the input image. Along with the predicted
traveling distance, SPF transforms predicted 2D waypoints into 3D displacement
vectors as action commands for UAVs. Moreover, SPF also adaptively adjusts the
traveling distance to facilitate more efficient navigation. Notably, SPF
performs navigation in a closed-loop control manner, enabling UAVs to follow
dynamic targets in dynamic environments. SPF sets a new state of the art in DRL
simulation benchmark, outperforming the previous best method by an absolute
margin of 63%. In extensive real-world evaluations, SPF outperforms strong
baselines by a large margin. We also conduct comprehensive ablation studies to
highlight the effectiveness of our design choice. Lastly, SPF shows remarkable
generalization to different VLMs. Project page: https://spf-web.pages.dev",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22653v1,,False
Hierarchical Representation Matching for CLIP-based Class-Incremental Learning,26/09/2025,"Zhen-Hao Wen, Yan Wang, Ji Feng, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan, Da-Wei Zhou","Class-Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to endow models with the ability to
continuously adapt to evolving data streams. Recent advances in pre-trained
vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) provide a powerful foundation for this
task. However, existing approaches often rely on simplistic templates, such as
""a photo of a [CLASS]"", which overlook the hierarchical nature of visual
concepts. For example, recognizing ""cat"" versus ""car"" depends on coarse-grained
cues, while distinguishing ""cat"" from ""lion"" requires fine-grained details.
Similarly, the current feature mapping in CLIP relies solely on the
representation from the last layer, neglecting the hierarchical information
contained in earlier layers. In this work, we introduce HiErarchical
Representation MAtchiNg (HERMAN) for CLIP-based CIL. Our approach leverages
LLMs to recursively generate discriminative textual descriptors, thereby
augmenting the semantic space with explicit hierarchical cues. These
descriptors are matched to different levels of the semantic hierarchy and
adaptively routed based on task-specific requirements, enabling precise
discrimination while alleviating catastrophic forgetting in incremental tasks.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22645v1,,False
The Lie of the Average: How Class Incremental Learning Evaluation Deceives You?,26/09/2025,"Guannan Lai, Da-Wei Zhou, Xin Yang, Han-Jia Ye","Class Incremental Learning (CIL) requires models to continuously learn new
classes without forgetting previously learned ones, while maintaining stable
performance across all possible class sequences. In real-world settings, the
order in which classes arrive is diverse and unpredictable, and model
performance can vary substantially across different sequences. Yet mainstream
evaluation protocols calculate mean and variance from only a small set of
randomly sampled sequences. Our theoretical analysis and empirical results
demonstrate that this sampling strategy fails to capture the full performance
range, resulting in biased mean estimates and a severe underestimation of the
true variance in the performance distribution. We therefore contend that a
robust CIL evaluation protocol should accurately characterize and estimate the
entire performance distribution. To this end, we introduce the concept of
extreme sequences and provide theoretical justification for their crucial role
in the reliable evaluation of CIL. Moreover, we observe a consistent positive
correlation between inter-task similarity and model performance, a relation
that can be leveraged to guide the search for extreme sequences. Building on
these insights, we propose EDGE (Extreme case-based Distribution and
Generalization Evaluation), an evaluation protocol that adaptively identifies
and samples extreme class sequences using inter-task similarity, offering a
closer approximation of the ground-truth performance distribution. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that EDGE effectively captures performance extremes and
yields more accurate estimates of distributional boundaries, providing
actionable insights for model selection and robustness checking. Our code is
available at https://github.com/AIGNLAI/EDGE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22580v1,,False
ECHO: Toward Contextual Seq2Seq Paradigms in Large EEG Models,26/09/2025,"Chenyu Liu, Yuqiu Deng, Tianyu Liu, Jinan Zhou, Xinliang Zhou, Ziyu Jia, Yi Ding","Electroencephalography (EEG), with its broad range of applications,
necessitates models that can generalize effectively across various tasks and
datasets. Large EEG Models (LEMs) address this by pretraining encoder-centric
architectures on large-scale unlabeled data to extract universal
representations. While effective, these models lack decoders of comparable
capacity, limiting the full utilization of the learned features. To address
this issue, we introduce ECHO, a novel decoder-centric LEM paradigm that
reformulates EEG modeling as sequence-to-sequence learning. ECHO captures
layered relationships among signals, labels, and tasks within sequence space,
while incorporating discrete support samples to construct contextual cues. This
design equips ECHO with in-context learning, enabling dynamic adaptation to
heterogeneous tasks without parameter updates. Extensive experiments across
multiple datasets demonstrate that, even with basic model components, ECHO
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art single-task LEMs in multi-task
settings, showing superior generalization and adaptability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22556v1,,False
Physics-informed GNN for medium-high voltage AC power flow with edge-aware attention and line search correction operator,26/09/2025,"Changhun Kim, Timon Conrad, Redwanul Karim, Julian Oelhaf, David Riebesel, Tomás Arias-Vergara, Andreas Maier, Johann Jäger, Siming Bayer","Physics-informed graph neural networks (PIGNNs) have emerged as fast AC
power-flow solvers that can replace classic Newton--Raphson (NR) solvers,
especially when thousands of scenarios must be evaluated. However, current
PIGNNs still need accuracy improvements at parity speed; in particular, the
physics loss is inoperative at inference, which can deter operational adoption.
We address this with PIGNN-Attn-LS, combining an edge-aware attention mechanism
that explicitly encodes line physics via per-edge biases, capturing the grid's
anisotropy, with a backtracking line-search-based globalized correction
operator that restores an operative decrease criterion at inference. Training
and testing use a realistic High-/Medium-Voltage scenario generator, with NR
used only to construct reference states. On held-out HV cases consisting of
4--32-bus grids, PIGNN-Attn-LS achieves a test RMSE of 0.00033 p.u. in voltage
and 0.08$^\circ$ in angle, outperforming the PIGNN-MLP baseline by 99.5\% and
87.1\%, respectively. With streaming micro-batches, it delivers 2--5$\times$
faster batched inference than NR on 4--1024-bus grids.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22458v1,,False
Overclocking Electrostatic Generative Models,26/09/2025,"Daniil Shlenskii, Alexander Korotin","Electrostatic generative models such as PFGM++ have recently emerged as a
powerful framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in image synthesis.
PFGM++ operates in an extended data space with auxiliary dimensionality $D$,
recovering the diffusion model framework as $D\to\infty$, while yielding
superior empirical results for finite $D$. Like diffusion models, PFGM++ relies
on expensive ODE simulations to generate samples, making it computationally
costly. To address this, we propose Inverse Poisson Flow Matching (IPFM), a
novel distillation framework that accelerates electrostatic generative models
across all values of $D$. Our IPFM reformulates distillation as an inverse
problem: learning a generator whose induced electrostatic field matches that of
the teacher. We derive a tractable training objective for this problem and show
that, as $D \to \infty$, our IPFM closely recovers Score Identity Distillation
(SiD), a recent method for distilling diffusion models. Empirically, our IPFM
produces distilled generators that achieve near-teacher or even superior sample
quality using only a few function evaluations. Moreover, we observe that
distillation converges faster for finite $D$ than in the $D \to \infty$
(diffusion) limit, which is consistent with prior findings that finite-$D$
PFGM++ models exhibit more favorable optimization and sampling properties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22454v1,,False
Guiding Evolution of Artificial Life Using Vision-Language Models,26/09/2025,"Nikhil Baid, Hannah Erlebach, Paul Hellegouarch, Frederico Wieser","Foundation models (FMs) have recently opened up new frontiers in the field of
artificial life (ALife) by providing powerful tools to automate search through
ALife simulations. Previous work aligns ALife simulations with natural language
target prompts using vision-language models (VLMs). We build on Automated
Search for Artificial Life (ASAL) by introducing ASAL++, a method for
open-ended-like search guided by multimodal FMs. We use a second FM to propose
new evolutionary targets based on a simulation's visual history. This induces
an evolutionary trajectory with increasingly complex targets.
  We explore two strategies: (1) evolving a simulation to match a single new
prompt at each iteration (Evolved Supervised Targets: EST) and (2) evolving a
simulation to match the entire sequence of generated prompts (Evolved Temporal
Targets: ETT). We test our method empirically in the Lenia substrate using
Gemma-3 to propose evolutionary targets, and show that EST promotes greater
visual novelty, while ETT fosters more coherent and interpretable evolutionary
sequences.
  Our results suggest that ASAL++ points towards new directions for FM-driven
ALife discovery with open-ended characteristics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22447v1,,False
ReLAM: Learning Anticipation Model for Rewarding Visual Robotic Manipulation,26/09/2025,"Nan Tang, Jing-Cheng Pang, Guanlin Li, Chao Qian, Yang Yu","Reward design remains a critical bottleneck in visual reinforcement learning
(RL) for robotic manipulation. In simulated environments, rewards are
conventionally designed based on the distance to a target position. However,
such precise positional information is often unavailable in real-world visual
settings due to sensory and perceptual limitations. In this study, we propose a
method that implicitly infers spatial distances through keypoints extracted
from images. Building on this, we introduce Reward Learning with Anticipation
Model (ReLAM), a novel framework that automatically generates dense, structured
rewards from action-free video demonstrations. ReLAM first learns an
anticipation model that serves as a planner and proposes intermediate
keypoint-based subgoals on the optimal path to the final goal, creating a
structured learning curriculum directly aligned with the task's geometric
objectives. Based on the anticipated subgoals, a continuous reward signal is
provided to train a low-level, goal-conditioned policy under the hierarchical
reinforcement learning (HRL) framework with provable sub-optimality bound.
Extensive experiments on complex, long-horizon manipulation tasks show that
ReLAM significantly accelerates learning and achieves superior performance
compared to state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22402v1,,False
Preventing Model Collapse Under Overparametrization: Optimal Mixing Ratios for Interpolation Learning and Ridge Regression,26/09/2025,"Anvit Garg, Sohom Bhattacharya, Pragya Sur","Model collapse occurs when generative models degrade after repeatedly
training on their own synthetic outputs. We study this effect in
overparameterized linear regression in a setting where each iteration mixes
fresh real labels with synthetic labels drawn from the model fitted in the
previous iteration. We derive precise generalization error formulae for
minimum-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation and ridge regression under this iterative
scheme. Our analysis reveals intriguing properties of the optimal mixing weight
that minimizes long-term prediction error and provably prevents model collapse.
For instance, in the case of min-$\ell_2$-norm interpolation, we establish that
the optimal real-data proportion converges to the reciprocal of the golden
ratio for fairly general classes of covariate distributions. Previously, this
property was known only for ordinary least squares, and additionally in low
dimensions. For ridge regression, we further analyze two popular model classes
-- the random-effects model and the spiked covariance model -- demonstrating
how spectral geometry governs optimal weighting. In both cases, as well as for
isotropic features, we uncover that the optimal mixing ratio should be at least
one-half, reflecting the necessity of favoring real-data over synthetic. We
validate our theoretical results with extensive simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22341v1,,False
Aurora: Towards Universal Generative Multimodal Time Series Forecasting,26/09/2025,"Xingjian Wu, Jianxin Jin, Wanghui Qiu, Peng Chen, Yang Shu, Bin Yang, Chenjuan Guo","Cross-domain generalization is very important in Time Series Forecasting
because similar historical information may lead to distinct future trends due
to the domain-specific characteristics. Recent works focus on building unimodal
time series foundation models and end-to-end multimodal supervised models.
Since domain-specific knowledge is often contained in modalities like texts,
the former lacks the explicit utilization of them, thus hindering the
performance. The latter is tailored for end-to-end scenarios and does not
support zero-shot inference for cross-domain scenarios. In this work, we
introduce Aurora, a Multimodal Time Series Foundation Model, which supports
multimodal inputs and zero-shot inference. Pretrained on Corss-domain
Multimodal Time Series Corpus, Aurora can adaptively extract and focus on key
domain knowledge contained in corrsponding text or image modalities, thus
possessing strong Cross-domain generalization capability. Through tokenization,
encoding, and distillation, Aurora can extract multimodal domain knowledge as
guidance and then utilizes a Modality-Guided Multi-head Self-Attention to
inject them into the modeling of temporal representations. In the decoding
phase, the multimodal representations are used to generate the conditions and
prototypes of future tokens, contributing to a novel Prototype-Guided Flow
Matching for generative probabilistic forecasting. Comprehensive experiments on
well-recognized benchmarks, including TimeMMD, TSFM-Bench and ProbTS,
demonstrate the consistent state-of-the-art performance of Aurora on both
unimodal and multimodal scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22295v1,,False
Conditional Denoising Diffusion Autoencoders for Wireless Semantic Communications,26/09/2025,"Mehdi Letafati, Samad Ali, Matti Latva-aho","Semantic communication (SemCom) systems aim to learn the mapping from
low-dimensional semantics to high-dimensional ground-truth. While this is more
akin to a ""domain translation"" problem, existing frameworks typically emphasize
on channel-adaptive neural encoding-decoding schemes, lacking full exploration
of signal distribution. Moreover, such methods so far have employed
autoencoder-based architectures, where the encoding is tightly coupled to a
matched decoder, causing scalability issues in practice. To address these gaps,
diffusion autoencoder models are proposed for wireless SemCom. The goal is to
learn a ""semantic-to-clean"" mapping, from the semantic space to the
ground-truth probability distribution. A neural encoder at semantic transmitter
extracts the high-level semantics, and a conditional diffusion model (CDiff) at
the semantic receiver exploits the source distribution for signal-space
denoising, while the received semantic latents are incorporated as the
conditioning input to ""steer"" the decoding process towards the semantics
intended by the transmitter. It is analytically proved that the proposed
decoder model is a consistent estimator of the ground-truth data. Furthermore,
extensive simulations over CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets are provided along with
design insights, highlighting the performance compared to legacy autoencoders
and variational autoencoders (VAE). Simulations are further extended to the
multi-user SemCom, identifying the dominating factors in a more realistic
setup.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22282v1,,False
Unlocking the Power of Mixture-of-Experts for Task-Aware Time Series Analytics,26/09/2025,"Xingjian Wu, Zhengyu Li, Hanyin Cheng, Xiangfei Qiu, Jilin Hu, Chenjuan Guo, Bin Yang","Time Series Analysis is widely used in various real-world applications such
as weather forecasting, financial fraud detection, imputation for missing data
in IoT systems, and classification for action recognization. Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE), as a powerful architecture, though demonstrating effectiveness in NLP,
still falls short in adapting to versatile tasks in time series analytics due
to its task-agnostic router and the lack of capability in modeling channel
correlations. In this study, we propose a novel, general MoE-based time series
framework called PatchMoE to support the intricate ``knowledge'' utilization
for distinct tasks, thus task-aware. Based on the observation that hierarchical
representations often vary across tasks, e.g., forecasting vs. classification,
we propose a Recurrent Noisy Gating to utilize the hierarchical information in
routing, thus obtaining task-sepcific capability. And the routing strategy is
operated on time series tokens in both temporal and channel dimensions, and
encouraged by a meticulously designed Temporal \& Channel Load Balancing Loss
to model the intricate temporal and channel correlations. Comprehensive
experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of PatchMoE.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22279v1,,False
InfiMed-Foundation: Pioneering Advanced Multimodal Medical Models with Compute-Efficient Pre-Training and Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning,26/09/2025,"Guanghao Zhu, Zhitian Hou, Zeyu Liu, Zhijie Sang, Congkai Xie, Hongxia Yang","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
various domains, yet their application in the medical field is hindered by
several challenges. General-purpose MLLMs often lack the specialized knowledge
required for medical tasks, leading to uncertain or hallucinatory responses.
Knowledge distillation from advanced models struggles to capture
domain-specific expertise in radiology and pharmacology. Additionally, the
computational cost of continual pretraining with large-scale medical data poses
significant efficiency challenges. To address these issues, we propose
InfiMed-Foundation-1.7B and InfiMed-Foundation-4B, two medical-specific MLLMs
designed to deliver state-of-the-art performance in medical applications. We
combined high-quality general-purpose and medical multimodal data and proposed
a novel five-dimensional quality assessment framework to curate high-quality
multimodal medical datasets. We employ low-to-high image resolution and
multimodal sequence packing to enhance training efficiency, enabling the
integration of extensive medical data. Furthermore, a three-stage supervised
fine-tuning process ensures effective knowledge extraction for complex medical

Beyond Classification Accuracy: Neural-MedBench and the Need for Deeper Reasoning Benchmarks,26/09/2025,"Miao Jing, Mengting Jia, Junling Lin, Zhongxia Shen, Lijun Wang, Yuanyuan Peng, Huan Gao, Mingkun Xu, Shangyang Li","Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable
performance on standard medical benchmarks, yet their true clinical reasoning
ability remains unclear. Existing datasets predominantly emphasize
classification accuracy, creating an evaluation illusion in which models appear
proficient while still failing at high-stakes diagnostic reasoning. We
introduce Neural-MedBench, a compact yet reasoning-intensive benchmark
specifically designed to probe the limits of multimodal clinical reasoning in
neurology. Neural-MedBench integrates multi-sequence MRI scans, structured
electronic health records, and clinical notes, and encompasses three core task
families: differential diagnosis, lesion recognition, and rationale generation.
To ensure reliable evaluation, we develop a hybrid scoring pipeline that
combines LLM-based graders, clinician validation, and semantic similarity
metrics. Through systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art VLMs, including
GPT-4o, Claude-4, and MedGemma, we observe a sharp performance drop compared to
conventional datasets. Error analysis shows that reasoning failures, rather
than perceptual errors, dominate model shortcomings. Our findings highlight the
necessity of a Two-Axis Evaluation Framework: breadth-oriented large datasets
for statistical generalization, and depth-oriented, compact benchmarks such as
Neural-MedBench for reasoning fidelity. We release Neural-MedBench at

Log2Plan: An Adaptive GUI Automation Framework Integrated with Task Mining Approach,26/09/2025,"Seoyoung Lee, Seonbin Yoon, Seongbeen Lee, Hyesoo Kim, Joo Yong Sim","GUI task automation streamlines repetitive tasks, but existing LLM or
VLM-based planner-executor agents suffer from brittle generalization, high

Log2Plan addresses these limitations by combining a structured two-level
planning framework with a task mining approach over user behavior logs,
enabling robust and adaptable GUI automation. Log2Plan constructs high-level
plans by mapping user commands to a structured task dictionary, enabling
consistent and generalizable automation. To support personalization and reuse,
it employs a task mining approach from user behavior logs that identifies
user-specific patterns. These high-level plans are then grounded into low-level
action sequences by interpreting real-time GUI context, ensuring robust
execution across varying interfaces. We evaluated Log2Plan on 200 real-world

Bridging Draft Policy Misalignment: Group Tree Optimization for Speculative Decoding,26/09/2025,"Shijing Hu, Jingyang Li, Zhihui Lu, Pan Zhou","Speculative decoding accelerates large language model (LLM) inference by
letting a lightweight draft model propose multiple tokens that the target model
verifies in parallel. Yet existing training objectives optimize only a single
greedy draft path, while decoding follows a tree policy that re-ranks and
verifies multiple branches. This draft policy misalignment limits achievable
speedups. We introduce Group Tree Optimization (GTO), which aligns training
with the decoding-time tree policy through two components: (i) Draft Tree
Reward, a sampling-free objective equal to the expected acceptance length of
the draft tree under the target model, directly measuring decoding performance;
(ii) Group-based Draft Policy Training, a stable optimization scheme that
contrasts trees from the current and a frozen reference draft model, forming
debiased group-standardized advantages and applying a PPO-style surrogate along
the longest accepted sequence for robust updates. We further prove that
increasing our Draft Tree Reward provably improves acceptance length and
speedup. Across dialogue (MT-Bench), code (HumanEval), and math (GSM8K), and
multiple LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.1-8B, LLaMA-3.3-70B, Vicuna-1.3-13B,
DeepSeek-R1-Distill-LLaMA-8B), GTO increases acceptance length by 7.4% and

Direct Bias-Correction Term Estimation for Propensity Scores and Average Treatment Effect Estimation,26/09/2025,Masahiro Kato,"This study considers the estimation of the average treatment effect (ATE).
For ATE estimation, we estimate the propensity score through direct
bias-correction term estimation. Let $\{(X_i, D_i, Y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n}$ be the
observations, where $X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$ denotes $p$-dimensional covariates,
$D_i \in \{0, 1\}$ denotes a binary treatment assignment indicator, and $Y_i
\in \mathbb{R}$ is an outcome. In ATE estimation, the bias-correction term
$h_0(X_i, D_i) = \frac{1[D_i = 1]}{e_0(X_i)} - \frac{1[D_i = 0]}{1 - e_0(X_i)}$
plays an important role, where $e_0(X_i)$ is the propensity score, the
probability of being assigned treatment $1$. In this study, we propose
estimating $h_0$ (or equivalently the propensity score $e_0$) by directly
minimizing the prediction error of $h_0$. Since the bias-correction term $h_0$
is essential for ATE estimation, this direct approach is expected to improve
estimation accuracy for the ATE. For example, existing studies often employ
maximum likelihood or covariate balancing to estimate $e_0$, but these
approaches may not be optimal for accurately estimating $h_0$ or the ATE. We
present a general framework for this direct bias-correction term estimation
approach from the perspective of Bregman divergence minimization and conduct
simulation studies to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.22122v1,,False
Reinforcement Learning for Durable Algorithmic Recourse,26/09/2025,"Marina Ceccon, Alessandro Fabris, Goran Radanović, Asia J. Biega, Gian Antonio Susto","Algorithmic recourse seeks to provide individuals with actionable

resource-constrained settings where recommendations shape future applicant
pools. In this work, we present a novel time-aware framework for algorithmic
recourse, explicitly modeling how candidate populations adapt in response to
recommendations. Additionally, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning
(RL)-based recourse algorithm that captures the evolving dynamics of the
environment to generate recommendations that are both feasible and valid. We
design our recommendations to be durable, supporting validity over a predefined
time horizon T. This durability allows individuals to confidently reapply after
taking time to implement the suggested changes. Through extensive experiments
in complex simulation environments, we show that our approach substantially
outperforms existing baselines, offering a superior balance between feasibility

Comparative Analysis of GAN and Diffusion for MRI-to-CT translation,26/09/2025,"Emily Honey, Anders Helbo, Jens Petersen","Computed tomography (CT) is essential for treatment and diagnostics; In case
CT are missing or otherwise difficult to obtain, methods for generating
synthetic CT (sCT) images from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are
sought after. Therefore, it is valuable to establish a reference for what
strategies are most effective for MRI-to-CT translation. In this paper, we
compare the performance of two frequently used architectures for MRI-to-CT
translation: a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) and a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (cDDPM). We chose
well-established implementations to represent each architecture: Pix2Pix for
cGAN, and Palette for cDDPM. We separate the classical 3D translation problem
into a sequence of 2D translations on the transverse plane, to investigate the
viability of a strategy that reduces the computational cost. We also
investigate the impact of conditioning the generative process on a single MRI
image/slice and on multiple MRI slices. The performance is assessed using a
thorough evaluation protocol, including a novel slice-wise metric Similarity Of

A Nonparametric Discrete Hawkes Model with a Collapsed Gaussian-Process Prior,26/09/2025,"Trinnhallen Brisley, Gordon Ross, Daniel Paulin","Hawkes process models are used in settings where past events increase the
likelihood of future events occurring. Many applications record events as
counts on a regular grid, yet discrete-time Hawkes models remain comparatively
underused and are often constrained by fixed-form baselines and excitation
kernels. In particular, there is a lack of flexible, nonparametric treatments
of both the baseline and the excitation in discrete time. To this end, we
propose the Gaussian Process Discrete Hawkes Process (GP-DHP), a nonparametric
framework that places Gaussian process priors on both the baseline and the
excitation and performs inference through a collapsed latent representation.
This yields smooth, data-adaptive structure without prespecifying trends,
periodicities, or decay shapes, and enables maximum a posteriori (MAP)
estimation with near-linear-time \(O(T\log T)\) complexity. A closed-form
projection recovers interpretable baseline and excitation functions from the
optimized latent trajectory. In simulations, GP-DHP recovers diverse excitation
shapes and evolving baselines. In case studies on U.S. terrorism incidents and

Extracting Actionable Insights from Building Energy Data using Vision LLMs on Wavelet and 3D Recurrence Representations,26/09/2025,"Amine Bechar, Adel Oulefki, Abbes Amira, Fatih Kurogollu, Yassine Himeur","The analysis of complex building time-series for actionable insights and
recommendations remains challenging due to the nonlinear and multi-scale

continuous wavelet transforms (CWTs) and recurrence plots (RPs), which capture
temporal dynamics and localize frequency anomalies. These 3D encodings enable
VLLMs to visually interpret energy-consumption patterns, detect anomalies, and
provide recommendations for energy efficiency. We demonstrate the framework on
real-world building-energy datasets, where fine-tuned VLLMs successfully
monitor building states, identify recurring anomalies, and generate
optimization recommendations. Quantitatively, the Idefics-7B VLLM achieves

SAGE: Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution for Long-Horizon Manipulation Tasks,26/09/2025,"Jialiang Li, Wenzheng Wu, Gaojing Zhang, Yifan Han, Wenzhao Lian","Successfully solving long-horizon manipulation tasks remains a fundamental
challenge. These tasks involve extended action sequences and complex object
interactions, presenting a critical gap between high-level symbolic planning
and low-level continuous control. To bridge this gap, two essential
capabilities are required: robust long-horizon task planning and effective
goal-conditioned manipulation. Existing task planning methods, including
traditional and LLM-based approaches, often exhibit limited generalization or
sparse semantic reasoning. Meanwhile, image-conditioned control methods
struggle to adapt to unseen tasks. To tackle these problems, we propose SAGE, a
novel framework for Scene Graph-Aware Guidance and Execution in Long-Horizon
Manipulation Tasks. SAGE utilizes semantic scene graphs as a structural
representation for scene states. A structural scene graph enables bridging
task-level semantic reasoning and pixel-level visuo-motor control. This also
facilitates the controllable synthesis of accurate, novel sub-goal images. SAGE
consists of two key components: (1) a scene graph-based task planner that uses
VLMs and LLMs to parse the environment and reason about physically-grounded
scene state transition sequences, and (2) a decoupled structural image editing
pipeline that controllably converts each target sub-goal graph into a
corresponding image through image inpainting and composition. Extensive
experiments have demonstrated that SAGE achieves state-of-the-art performance
on distinct long-horizon tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21928v1,,False
Discrete Guidance Matching: Exact Guidance for Discrete Flow Matching,26/09/2025,"Zhengyan Wan, Yidong Ouyang, Liyan Xie, Fang Fang, Hongyuan Zha, Guang Cheng","Guidance provides a simple and effective framework for posterior sampling by
steering the generation process towards the desired distribution. When modeling
discrete data, existing approaches mostly focus on guidance with the
first-order Taylor approximation to improve the sampling efficiency. However,
such an approximation is inappropriate in discrete state spaces since the
approximation error could be large. A novel guidance framework for discrete
data is proposed to address this problem: We derive the exact transition rate
for the desired distribution given a learned discrete flow matching model,
leading to guidance that only requires a single forward pass in each sampling
step, significantly improving efficiency. This unified novel framework is
general enough, encompassing existing guidance methods as special cases, and it
can also be seamlessly applied to the masked diffusion model. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed guidance on energy-guided simulations and
preference alignment on text-to-image generation and multimodal understanding
tasks. The code is available through

"MolSpectLLM: A Molecular Foundation Model Bridging Spectroscopy, Molecule Elucidation, and 3D Structure Generation",26/09/2025,"Shuaike Shen, Jiaqing Xie, Zhuo Yang, Antong Zhang, Shuzhou Sun, Ben Gao, Tianfan Fu, Biqing Qi, Yuqiang Li","Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive
performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with
promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction.
Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES
representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural
information-two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in
real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks
where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are
critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular
foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental
spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular
spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related
tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks.
MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task,
obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on
Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More
importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular
elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly
from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular
elucidation, and molecular design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21861v1,,False
Self-Speculative Biased Decoding for Faster Live Translation,26/09/2025,"Linxiao Zeng, Haoyun Deng, Kangyuan Shu, Shizhen Wang","Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive
capabilities in various text generation tasks. However, it remains challenging
to use them off-the-shelf in streaming applications (such as live translation),
where the output must continually update as the input context expands, while
still maintaining a reasonable computational cost to meet the latency
requirement.
  In this work, we reexamine the re-translation approach to simultaneous
translation and propose Self-Speculative Biased Decoding, a novel inference
paradigm designed to avoid repeatedly generating output from scratch for a
consistently growing input stream. We propose using the most recent output as a
draft for the current growing input context. During the verification stage, the
output will be biased towards the draft token for a higher draft acceptance
rate. This strategy not only minimizes flickering that might distract users but
also leads to higher speedups. Conventional decoding may take charge from the
point of divergence after draft verification and continue until the end
condition is met.
  Unlike existing speculative decoding strategies, our approach eliminates the
need for draft computations, making it a model-agnostic and plug-and-play
solution for accelerating latency-sensitive streaming applications.
Experimental results on simultaneous text-to-text re-translation demonstrate
that our approach achieves up to 1.7x speedup compared to conventional
auto-regressive re-translation without compromising quality. Additionally, it
significantly reduces flickering by 80% by incorporating the display-only
mask-k technique.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21740v1,,False
UISim: An Interactive Image-Based UI Simulator for Dynamic Mobile Environments,26/09/2025,"Jiannan Xiang, Yun Zhu, Lei Shu, Maria Wang, Lijun Yu, Gabriel Barcik, James Lyon, Srinivas Sunkara, Jindong Chen","Developing and testing user interfaces (UIs) and training AI agents to
interact with them are challenging due to the dynamic and diverse nature of
real-world mobile environments. Existing methods often rely on cumbersome
physical devices or limited static analysis of screenshots, which hinders
scalable testing and the development of intelligent UI agents. We introduce
UISim, a novel image-based UI simulator that offers a dynamic and interactive
platform for exploring mobile phone environments purely from screen images. Our
system employs a two-stage method: given an initial phone screen image and a
user action, it first predicts the abstract layout of the next UI state, then
synthesizes a new, visually consistent image based on this predicted layout.
This approach enables the realistic simulation of UI transitions. UISim
provides immediate practical benefits for UI testing, rapid prototyping, and
synthetic data generation. Furthermore, its interactive capabilities pave the
way for advanced applications, such as UI navigation task planning for AI
agents. Our experimental results show that UISim outperforms end-to-end UI
generation baselines in generating realistic and coherent subsequent UI states,
highlighting its fidelity and potential to streamline UI development and
enhance AI agent training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21733v1,,False
Multi-modal Bayesian Neural Network Surrogates with Conjugate Last-Layer Estimation,26/09/2025,"Ian Taylor, Juliane Mueller, Julie Bessac","As data collection and simulation capabilities advance, multi-modal learning,
the task of learning from multiple modalities and sources of data, is becoming
an increasingly important area of research. Surrogate models that learn from
data of multiple auxiliary modalities to support the modeling of a highly
expensive quantity of interest have the potential to aid outer loop
applications such as optimization, inverse problems, or sensitivity analyses
when multi-modal data are available. We develop two multi-modal Bayesian neural
network surrogate models and leverage conditionally conjugate distributions in
the last layer to estimate model parameters using stochastic variational
inference (SVI). We provide a method to perform this conjugate SVI estimation
in the presence of partially missing observations. We demonstrate improved
prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification compared to uni-modal
surrogate models for both scalar and time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21711v1,,False
