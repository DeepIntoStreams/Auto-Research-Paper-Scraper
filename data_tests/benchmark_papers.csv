IntervenGen: Interventional Data Generation for Robust and Data-Efficient Robot Imitation Learning,02/05/2024,"Ryan Hoque, Ajay Mandlekar, Caelan Garrett, Ken Goldberg, Dieter Fox","Imitation learning is a promising paradigm for training robot control policies, but these policies can suffer from distribution shift, where the conditions at evaluation time differ from those in the training data. A popular approach for increasing policy robustness to distribution shift is interactive imitation learning (i.e., DAgger and variants), where a human operator provides corrective interventions during policy rollouts. However, collecting a sufficient amount of interventions to cover the distribution of policy mistakes can be burdensome for human operators. We propose IntervenGen (I-Gen), a novel data generation system that can autonomously produce a large set of corrective interventions with rich coverage of the state space from a small number of human interventions. We apply I-Gen to 4 simulated environments and 1 physical environment with object pose estimation error and show that it can increase policy robustness by up to 39x with only 10 human interventions.

Data Scoping: Effectively Learning the Evolution of Generic Transport PDEs,02/05/2024,"Jiangce Chen, Wenzhuo Xu, Zeda Xu, Noelia Grande Guti√©rrez, Sneha Prabha Narra, Christopher McComb","Transport phenomena (e.g., fluid flows) are governed by time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) describing mass, momentum, and energy conservation, and are ubiquitous in many engineering applications. However, deep learning architectures are fundamentally incompatible with the simulation of these PDEs. This paper clearly articulates and then solves this incompatibility. The local-dependency of generic transport PDEs implies that it only involves local information to predict the physical properties at a location in the next time step. However, the deep learning architecture will inevitably increase the scope of information to make such predictions as the number of layers increases, which can cause sluggish convergence and compromise generalizability. This paper aims to solve this problem by proposing a distributed data scoping method with linear time complexity to strictly limit the scope of information to predict the local properties. The numerical experiments over multiple physics show that our data scoping method significantly accelerates training convergence and improves the generalizability of benchmark models on large-scale engineering simulations. Specifically, over the geometries not included in the training data for heat transferring simulation, it can increase the accuracy of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) by 21.7 \% and that of Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) by 38.5 \% on average.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01319v1,,N,N,N,N
Multivariate trace estimation using quantum state space linear algebra,02/05/2024,"Liron Mor Yosef, Shashanka Ubaru, Lior Horesh, Haim Avron","In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for approximating multivariate traces, i.e. the traces of matrix products. Our research is motivated by the extensive utility of multivariate traces in elucidating spectral characteristics of matrices, as well as by recent advancements in leveraging quantum computing for faster numerical linear algebra. Central to our approach is a direct translation of a multivariate trace formula into a quantum circuit, achieved through a sequence of low-level circuit construction operations. To facilitate this translation, we introduce \emph{quantum Matrix States Linear Algebra} (qMSLA), a framework tailored for the efficient generation of state preparation circuits via primitive matrix algebra operations. Our algorithm relies on sets of state preparation circuits for input matrices as its primary inputs and yields two state preparation circuits encoding the multivariate trace as output. These circuits are constructed utilizing qMSLA operations, which enact the aforementioned multivariate trace formula. We emphasize that our algorithm's inputs consist solely of state preparation circuits, eschewing harder to synthesize constructs such as Block Encodings. Furthermore, our approach operates independently of the availability of specialized hardware like QRAM, underscoring its versatility and practicality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01098v1,,N,N,N,N
"A text-based, generative deep learning model for soil reflectance spectrum simulation in the VIS-NIR (400-2499 nm) bands",02/05/2024,"Tong Lei, Brian N. Bailey","Simulating soil reflectance spectra is invaluable for soil-plant radiative modeling and training machine learning models, yet it is difficult as the intricate relationships between soil structure and its constituents. To address this, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra based on soil property inputs was developed. The model is trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property pairs from 17 datasets. It generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format. The generative model can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties. SOGM is based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the full visible-near-infrared range (VIS-NIR; 400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. The SOGM was up-scaled by coupling with the Helios 3D plant modeling software, which allowed for generation of synthetic aerial images of simulated soil and plant scenes. It can also be easily integrated with soil-plant radiation model used for remote sensin research like PROSAIL. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets that not included in model training proved that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs. The presented models are openly accessible on: https://github.com/GEMINI-Breeding/SOGM_soil_spectra_simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.01060v1,,N,N,N,N
SparseTSF: Modeling Long-term Time Series Forecasting with 1k Parameters,02/05/2024,"Shengsheng Lin, Weiwei Lin, Wentai Wu, Haojun Chen, Junjie Yang","This paper introduces SparseTSF, a novel, extremely lightweight model for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF), designed to address the challenges of modeling complex temporal dependencies over extended horizons with minimal computational resources. At the heart of SparseTSF lies the Cross-Period Sparse Forecasting technique, which simplifies the forecasting task by decoupling the periodicity and trend in time series data. This technique involves downsampling the original sequences to focus on cross-period trend prediction, effectively extracting periodic features while minimizing the model's complexity and parameter count. Based on this technique, the SparseTSF model uses fewer than 1k parameters to achieve competitive or superior performance compared to state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, SparseTSF showcases remarkable generalization capabilities, making it well-suited for scenarios with limited computational resources, small samples, or low-quality data.

Machine Learning Techniques for Data Reduction of Climate Applications,01/05/2024,"Xiao Li, Qian Gong, Jaemoon Lee, Scott Klasky, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka","Scientists conduct large-scale simulations to compute derived quantities-of-interest (QoI) from primary data. Often, QoI are linked to specific features, regions, or time intervals, such that data can be adaptively reduced without compromising the integrity of QoI. For many spatiotemporal applications, these QoI are binary in nature and represent presence or absence of a physical phenomenon. We present a pipelined compression approach that first uses neural-network-based techniques to derive regions where QoI are highly likely to be present. Then, we employ a Guaranteed Autoencoder (GAE) to compress data with differential error bounds. GAE uses QoI information to apply low-error compression to only these regions. This results in overall high compression ratios while still achieving downstream goals of simulation or data collections. Experimental results are presented for climate data generated from the E3SM Simulation model for downstream quantities such as tropical cyclone and atmospheric river detection and tracking. These results show that our approach is superior to comparable methods in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00879v1,,N,N,N,N
Gameplay Filters: Safe Robot Walking through Adversarial Imagination,01/05/2024,"Duy P. Nguyen, Kai-Chieh Hsu, Wenhao Yu, Jie Tan, Jaime F. Fisac","Ensuring the safe operation of legged robots in uncertain, novel environments is crucial to their widespread adoption. Despite recent advances in safety filters that can keep arbitrary task-driven policies from incurring safety failures, existing solutions for legged robot locomotion still rely on simplified dynamics and may fail when the robot is perturbed away from predefined stable gaits. This paper presents a general approach that leverages offline game-theoretic reinforcement learning to synthesize a highly robust safety filter for high-order nonlinear dynamics. This gameplay filter then maintains runtime safety by continually simulating adversarial futures and precluding task-driven actions that would cause it to lose future games (and thereby violate safety). Validated on a 36-dimensional quadruped robot locomotion task, the gameplay safety filter exhibits inherent robustness to the sim-to-real gap without manual tuning or heuristic designs. Physical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the gameplay safety filter under perturbations, such as tugging and unmodeled irregular terrains, while simulation studies shed light on how to trade off computation and conservativeness without compromising safety.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00846v1,,N,N,N,N
DAM: A Universal Dual Attention Mechanism for Multimodal Timeseries Cryptocurrency Trend Forecasting,01/05/2024,"Yihang Fu, Mingyu Zhou, Luyao Zhang","In the distributed systems landscape, Blockchain has catalyzed the rise of cryptocurrencies, merging enhanced security and decentralization with significant investment opportunities. Despite their potential, current research on cryptocurrency trend forecasting often falls short by simplistically merging sentiment data without fully considering the nuanced interplay between financial market dynamics and external sentiment influences. This paper presents a novel Dual Attention Mechanism (DAM) for forecasting cryptocurrency trends using multimodal time-series data. Our approach, which integrates critical cryptocurrency metrics with sentiment data from news and social media analyzed through CryptoBERT, addresses the inherent volatility and prediction challenges in cryptocurrency markets. By combining elements of distributed systems, natural language processing, and financial forecasting, our method outperforms conventional models like LSTM and Transformer by up to 20\% in prediction accuracy. This advancement deepens the understanding of distributed systems and has practical implications in financial markets, benefiting stakeholders in cryptocurrency and blockchain technologies. Moreover, our enhanced forecasting approach can significantly support decentralized science (DeSci) by facilitating strategic planning and the efficient adoption of blockchain technologies, improving operational efficiency and financial risk management in the rapidly evolving digital asset domain, thus ensuring optimal resource allocation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00522v1,,N,N,N,Y
Weight Sparsity Complements Activity Sparsity in Neuromorphic Language Models,01/05/2024,"Rishav Mukherji, Mark Sch√∂ne, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Christian Mayr, David Kappel, Anand Subramoney","Activity and parameter sparsity are two standard methods of making neural networks computationally more efficient. Event-based architectures such as spiking neural networks (SNNs) naturally exhibit activity sparsity, and many methods exist to sparsify their connectivity by pruning weights. While the effect of weight pruning on feed-forward SNNs has been previously studied for computer vision tasks, the effects of pruning for complex sequence tasks like language modeling are less well studied since SNNs have traditionally struggled to achieve meaningful performance on these tasks. Using a recently published SNN-like architecture that works well on small-scale language modeling, we study the effects of weight pruning when combined with activity sparsity. Specifically, we study the trade-off between the multiplicative efficiency gains the combination affords and its effect on task performance for language modeling. To dissect the effects of the two sparsities, we conduct a comparative analysis between densely activated models and sparsely activated event-based models across varying degrees of connectivity sparsity. We demonstrate that sparse activity and sparse connectivity complement each other without a proportional drop in task performance for an event-based neural network trained on the Penn Treebank and WikiText-2 language modeling datasets. Our results suggest sparsely connected event-based neural networks are promising candidates for effective and efficient sequence modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00433v1,,N,N,N,Y
HMAMP: Hypervolume-Driven Multi-Objective Antimicrobial Peptides Design,01/05/2024,"Li Wang, Yiping Li, Xiangzheng Fu, Xiucai Ye, Junfeng Shi, Gary G. Yen, Xiangxiang Zeng","Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have exhibited unprecedented potential as biomaterials in combating multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite the increasing adoption of artificial intelligence for novel AMP design, challenges pertaining to conflicting attributes such as activity, hemolysis, and toxicity have significantly impeded the progress of researchers. This paper introduces a paradigm shift by considering multiple attributes in AMP design. Presented herein is a novel approach termed Hypervolume-driven Multi-objective Antimicrobial Peptide Design (HMAMP), which prioritizes the simultaneous optimization of multiple attributes of AMPs. By synergizing reinforcement learning and a gradient descent algorithm rooted in the hypervolume maximization concept, HMAMP effectively expands exploration space and mitigates the issue of pattern collapse. This method generates a wide array of prospective AMP candidates that strike a balance among diverse attributes. Furthermore, we pinpoint knee points along the Pareto front of these candidate AMPs. Empirical results across five benchmark models substantiate that HMAMP-designed AMPs exhibit competitive performance and heightened diversity. A detailed analysis of the helical structures and molecular dynamics simulations for ten potential candidate AMPs validates the superiority of HMAMP in the realm of multi-objective AMP design. The ability of HMAMP to systematically craft AMPs considering multiple attributes marks a pioneering milestone, establishing a universal computational framework for the multi-objective design of AMPs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00753v1,,N,N,N,N
How Can I Improve? Using GPT to Highlight the Desired and Undesired Parts of Open-ended Responses,01/05/2024,"Jionghao Lin, Eason Chen, Zeifei Han, Ashish Gurung, Danielle R. Thomas, Wei Tan, Ngoc Dang Nguyen, Kenneth R. Koedinger","Automated explanatory feedback systems play a crucial role in facilitating learning for a large cohort of learners by offering feedback that incorporates explanations, significantly enhancing the learning process. However, delivering such explanatory feedback in real-time poses challenges, particularly when high classification accuracy for domain-specific, nuanced responses is essential. Our study leverages the capabilities of large language models, specifically Generative Pre-Trained Transformers (GPT), to explore a sequence labeling approach focused on identifying components of desired and less desired praise for providing explanatory feedback within a tutor training dataset. Our aim is to equip tutors with actionable, explanatory feedback during online training lessons. To investigate the potential of GPT models for providing the explanatory feedback, we employed two commonly-used approaches: prompting and fine-tuning. To quantify the quality of highlighted praise components identified by GPT models, we introduced a Modified Intersection over Union (M-IoU) score. Our findings demonstrate that: (1) the M-IoU score effectively correlates with human judgment in evaluating sequence quality; (2) using two-shot prompting on GPT-3.5 resulted in decent performance in recognizing effort-based (M-IoU of 0.46) and outcome-based praise (M-IoU of 0.68); and (3) our optimally fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieved M-IoU scores of 0.64 for effort-based praise and 0.84 for outcome-based praise, aligning with the satisfaction levels evaluated by human coders. Our results show promise for using GPT models to provide feedback that focuses on specific elements in their open-ended responses that are desirable or could use improvement.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.00291v1,,N,N,N,N
A model-free subdata selection method for classification,29/04/2024,Rakhi Singh,"Subdata selection is a study of methods that select a small representative sample of the big data, the analysis of which is fast and statistically efficient. The existing subdata selection methods assume that the big data can be reasonably modeled using an underlying model, such as a (multinomial) logistic regression for classification problems. These methods work extremely well when the underlying modeling assumption is correct but often yield poor results otherwise. In this paper, we propose a model-free subdata selection method for classification problems, and the resulting subdata is called PED subdata. The PED subdata uses decision trees to find a partition of the data, followed by selecting an appropriate sample from each component of the partition. Random forests are used for analyzing the selected subdata. Our method can be employed for a general number of classes in the response and for both categorical and continuous predictors. We show analytically that the PED subdata results in a smaller Gini than a uniform subdata. Further, we demonstrate that the PED subdata has higher classification accuracy than other competing methods through extensive simulated and real datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.19127v1,,N,N,N,N

We show that these two tasks can be unified by using maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) from conditional generative models for energy regression. Unlike direct regression techniques, the MLE approach is prior-independent and non-Gaussian resolutions can be determined from the shape of the likelihood near the maximum. Using an ATLAS-like calorimeter simulation, we demonstrate this concept in the context of calorimeter energy calibration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18992v1,,N,N,N,N
A Survey on Diffusion Models for Time Series and Spatio-Temporal Data,29/04/2024,"Yiyuan Yang, Ming Jin, Haomin Wen, Chaoli Zhang, Yuxuan Liang, Lintao Ma, Yi Wang, Chenghao Liu, Bin Yang, Zenglin Xu, Jiang Bian, Shirui Pan, Qingsong Wen","The study of time series data is crucial for understanding trends and anomalies over time, enabling predictive insights across various sectors. Spatio-temporal data, on the other hand, is vital for analyzing phenomena in both space and time, providing a dynamic perspective on complex system interactions. Recently, diffusion models have seen widespread application in time series and spatio-temporal data mining. Not only do they enhance the generative and inferential capabilities for sequential and temporal data, but they also extend to other downstream tasks. In this survey, we comprehensively and thoroughly review the use of diffusion models in time series and spatio-temporal data, categorizing them by model category, task type, data modality, and practical application domain. In detail, we categorize diffusion models into unconditioned and conditioned types and discuss time series data and spatio-temporal data separately. Unconditioned models, which operate unsupervised, are subdivided into probability-based and score-based models, serving predictive and generative tasks such as forecasting, anomaly detection, classification, and imputation. Conditioned models, on the other hand, utilize extra information to enhance performance and are similarly divided for both predictive and generative tasks. Our survey extensively covers their application in various fields, including healthcare, recommendation, climate, energy, audio, and transportation, providing a foundational understanding of how these models analyze and generate data. Through this structured overview, we aim to provide researchers and practitioners with a comprehensive understanding of diffusion models for time series and spatio-temporal data analysis, aiming to direct future innovations and applications by addressing traditional challenges and exploring innovative solutions within the diffusion model framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18886v1,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Machine Learning for Quantum Computing Specialists,29/04/2024,"Daniel Goldsmith, M M Hassan Mahmud","Quantum machine learning (QML) is a promising early use case for quantum computing.

Use cases demonstrated on contemporary quantum devices include classifying medical images and items from the Iris dataset, classifying and generating handwritten images, toxicity screening, and learning a probability distribution. Potential benefits of QML include faster training and identification of feature maps not found classically. Although, these examples lack the scale for commercial exploitation, and it may be several years before QML algorithms replace the classical solutions, QML is an exciting area. This article is written for those who already have a sound knowledge of quantum computing and now wish to gain a basic overview of the terminology and some applications of classical machine learning ready to study quantum machine learning.

Time Series Data Augmentation as an Imbalanced Learning Problem,29/04/2024,"Vitor Cerqueira, Nuno Moniz, Ricardo In√°cio, Carlos Soares","Recent state-of-the-art forecasting methods are trained on collections of time series. These methods, often referred to as global models, can capture common patterns in different time series to improve their generalization performance. However, they require large amounts of data that might not be readily available. Besides this, global models sometimes fail to capture relevant patterns unique to a particular time series. In these cases, data augmentation can be useful to increase the sample size of time series datasets. The main contribution of this work is a novel method for generating univariate time series synthetic samples. Our approach stems from the insight that the observations concerning a particular time series of interest represent only a small fraction of all observations. In this context, we frame the problem of training a forecasting model as an imbalanced learning task. Oversampling strategies are popular approaches used to deal with the imbalance problem in machine learning. We use these techniques to create synthetic time series observations and improve the accuracy of forecasting models. We carried out experiments using 7 different databases that contain a total of 5502 univariate time series. We found that the proposed solution outperforms both a global and a local model, thus providing a better trade-off between these two approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18537v1,,Y,N,N,Y
Parameter-Efficient Tuning Large Language Models for Graph Representation Learning,28/04/2024,"Qi Zhu, Da Zheng, Xiang Song, Shichang Zhang, Bowen Jin, Yizhou Sun, George Karypis","Text-rich graphs, which exhibit rich textual information on nodes and edges, are prevalent across a wide range of real-world business applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable abilities in understanding text, which also introduced the potential for more expressive modeling in text-rich graphs. Despite these capabilities, efficiently applying LLMs to representation learning on graphs presents significant challenges. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for LLMs have enabled efficient new task generalization with minimal time and memory consumption. Inspired by this, we introduce Graph-aware Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning - GPEFT, a novel approach for efficient graph representation learning with LLMs on text-rich graphs. Specifically, we utilize a graph neural network (GNN) to encode structural information from neighboring nodes into a graph prompt. This prompt is then inserted at the beginning of the text sequence. To improve the quality of graph prompts, we pre-trained the GNN to assist the frozen LLM in predicting the next token in the node text. Compared with existing joint GNN and LMs, our method directly generate the node embeddings from large language models with an affordable fine-tuning cost. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments conducted on 8 different text-rich graphs, observing an average improvement of 2% in hit@1 and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) in link prediction evaluations. Our results demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our model, showing that it can be smoothly integrated with various large language models, including OPT, LLaMA and Falcon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18271v1,,N,N,N,N
A Note on Asynchronous Challenges: Unveiling Formulaic Bias and Data Loss in the Hayashi-Yoshida Estimator,28/04/2024,Evangelos Georgiadis,"The Hayashi-Yoshida (\HY)-estimator exhibits an intrinsic, telescoping property that leads to an often overlooked computational bias, which we denote,formulaic or intrinsic bias. This formulaic bias results in data loss by cancelling out potentially relevant data points, the nonextant data points. This paper attempts to formalize and quantify the data loss arising from this bias. In particular, we highlight the existence of nonextant data points via a concrete example, and prove necessary and sufficient conditions for the telescoping property to induce this type of formulaic bias.Since this type of bias is nonexistent when inputs, i.e., observation times, $\Pi^{(1)} :=(t_i^{(1)})_{i=0,1,\ldots}$ and $\Pi^{(2)} :=(t_j^{(2)})_{j=0,1,\ldots}$, are synchronous, we introduce the (a,b)-asynchronous adversary. This adversary generates inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$ according to two independent homogenous Poisson processes with rates a>0 and b>0, respectively. We address the foundational questions regarding cumulative minimal (or least) average data point loss, and determine the values for a and b. We prove that for equal rates a=b, the minimal average cumulative data loss over both inputs is attained and amounts to 25\%. We present an algorithm, which is based on our theorem, for computing the exact number of nonextant data points given inputs $\Pi^{(1)}$ and $\Pi^{(2)}$, and suggest alternative methods. Finally, we use simulated data to empirically compare the (cumulative) average data loss of the (\HY)-estimator.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18233v1,,N,N,N,N

Unlike commonly homogeneous data such as pixelated images, simulating high-dimensional tabular data and accurately capturing their correlations are often quite challenging, even with the most advanced architectures. Based on the findings that tree-based models surpass the performance of deep learning models for tasks specific to tabular data, we adopt the very recent generative modeling class named conditional flow matching and employ different techniques to integrate the usage of Gradient Boosted Trees. The performances are evaluated for various tasks on different analysis level with several public datasets. We demonstrate the training and inference time of most high-level simulation tasks can achieve speedup by orders of magnitude.

This paper provides a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts, key techniques, and state-of-the-art dynamic GNN models. We present the mainstream dynamic GNN models in detail and categorize models based on how temporal information is incorporated. We also discuss large-scale dynamic GNNs and pre-training techniques.

Machine Learning Techniques for Data Reduction of CFD Applications,28/04/2024,"Jaemoon Lee, Ki Sung Jung, Qian Gong, Xiao Li, Scott Klasky, Jacqueline Chen, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka","We present an approach called guaranteed block autoencoder that leverages Tensor Correlations (GBATC) for reducing the spatiotemporal data generated by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and other scientific applications. It uses a multidimensional block of tensors (spanning in space and time) for both input and output, capturing the spatiotemporal and interspecies relationship within a tensor. The tensor consists of species that represent different elements in a CFD simulation. To guarantee the error bound of the reconstructed data, principal component analysis (PCA) is applied to the residual between the original and reconstructed data. This yields a basis matrix, which is then used to project the residual of each instance. The resulting coefficients are retained to enable accurate reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach can deliver two orders of magnitude in reduction while still keeping the errors of primary data under scientifically acceptable bounds. Compared to reduction-based approaches based on SZ, our method achieves a substantially higher compression ratio for a given error bound or a better error for a given compression ratio.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.18063v1,,N,N,N,N

Exploring the efficacy of a hybrid approach with modal decomposition over fully deep learning models for flow dynamics forecasting,27/04/2024,"Rodrigo Abad√≠a-Heredia, Adri√°n Corrochano, Manuel Lopez-Martin, Soledad Le Clainche","Fluid dynamics problems are characterized by being multidimensional and nonlinear, causing the experiments and numerical simulations being complex, time-consuming and monetarily expensive. In this sense, there is a need to find new ways to obtain data in a more economical manner. Thus, in this work we study the application of time series forecasting to fluid dynamics problems, where the aim is to predict the flow dynamics using only past information. We focus our study on models based on deep learning that do not require a high amount of data for training, as this is the problem we are trying to address. Specifically in this work we have tested three autoregressive models where two of them are fully based on deep learning and the other one is a hybrid model that combines modal decomposition with deep learning. We ask these models to generate $200$ time-ahead predictions of two datasets coming from a numerical simulation and experimental measurements, where the latter is characterized by being turbulent. We show how the hybrid model generates more reliable predictions in the experimental case, as it is physics-informed in the sense that the modal decomposition extracts the physics in a way that allows us to predict it.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17884v1,,N,N,N,Y
Uncertainty quantification for iterative algorithms in linear models with application to early stopping,27/04/2024,"Pierre C. Bellec, Kai Tan","This paper investigates the iterates $\hbb^1,\dots,\hbb^T$ obtained from iterative algorithms in high-dimensional linear regression problems, in the regime where the feature dimension $p$ is comparable with the sample size $n$, i.e., $p \asymp n$. The analysis and proposed estimators are applicable to Gradient Descent (GD), proximal GD and their accelerated variants such as Fast Iterative Soft-Thresholding (FISTA). The paper proposes novel estimators for the generalization error of the iterate $\hbb^t$ for any fixed iteration $t$ along the trajectory. These estimators are proved to be $\sqrt n$-consistent under Gaussian designs. Applications to early-stopping are provided: when the generalization error of the iterates is a U-shape function of the iteration $t$, the estimates allow to select from the data an iteration $\hat t$ that achieves the smallest generalization error along the trajectory. Additionally, we provide a technique for developing debiasing corrections and valid confidence intervals for the components of the true coefficient vector from the iterate $\hbb^t$ at any finite iteration $t$. Extensive simulations on synthetic data illustrate the theoretical results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17856v1,,N,N,N,N
Motion planning for off-road autonomous driving based on human-like cognition and weight adaptation,27/04/2024,"Yuchun Wang, Cheng Gong, Jianwei Gong, Peng Jia","Driving in an off-road environment is challenging for autonomous vehicles due to the complex and varied terrain. To ensure stable and efficient travel, the vehicle requires consideration and balancing of environmental factors, such as undulations, roughness, and obstacles, to generate optimal trajectories that can adapt to changing scenarios. However, traditional motion planners often utilize a fixed cost function for trajectory optimization, making it difficult to adapt to different driving strategies in challenging irregular terrains and uncommon scenarios. To address these issues, we propose an adaptive motion planner based on human-like cognition and cost evaluation for off-road driving. First, we construct a multi-layer map describing different features of off-road terrains, including terrain elevation, roughness, obstacle, and artificial potential field map. Subsequently, we employ a CNN-LSTM network to learn the trajectories planned by human drivers in various off-road scenarios. Then, based on human-like generated trajectories in different environments, we design a primitive-based trajectory planner that aims to mimic human trajectories and cost weight selection, generating trajectories that are consistent with the dynamics of off-road vehicles. Finally, we compute optimal cost weights and select and extend behavioral primitives to generate highly adaptive, stable, and efficient trajectories. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments in a desert off-road environment with complex terrain and varying road conditions. The experimental results show that the proposed human-like motion planner has excellent adaptability to different off-road conditions. It shows real-time operation, greater stability, and more human-like planning ability in diverse and challenging scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17820v1,10.1002/rob.22345,N,N,N,N
Empirical Analysis of Dialogue Relation Extraction with Large Language Models,27/04/2024,"Guozheng Li, Zijie Xu, Ziyu Shang, Jiajun Liu, Ke Ji, Yikai Guo","Dialogue relation extraction (DRE) aims to extract relations between two arguments within a dialogue, which is more challenging than standard RE due to the higher person pronoun frequency and lower information density in dialogues. However, existing DRE methods still suffer from two serious issues: (1) hard to capture long and sparse multi-turn information, and (2) struggle to extract golden relations based on partial dialogues, which motivates us to discover more effective methods that can alleviate the above issues. We notice that the rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked considerable interest in evaluating their performance across diverse tasks. To this end, we initially investigate the capabilities of different LLMs in DRE, considering both proprietary models and open-source models. Interestingly, we discover that LLMs significantly alleviate two issues in existing DRE methods. Generally, we have following findings: (1) scaling up model size substantially boosts the overall DRE performance and achieves exceptional results, tackling the difficulty of capturing long and sparse multi-turn information; (2) LLMs encounter with much smaller performance drop from entire dialogue setting to partial dialogue setting compared to existing methods; (3) LLMs deliver competitive or superior performances under both full-shot and few-shot settings compared to current state-of-the-art; (4) LLMs show modest performances on inverse relations but much stronger improvements on general relations, and they can handle dialogues of various lengths especially for longer sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17802v1,,N,N,N,N
An Attention-Based Deep Learning Architecture for Real-Time Monocular Visual Odometry: Applications to GPS-free Drone Navigation,27/04/2024,"Olivier Brochu Dufour, Abolfazl Mohebbi, Sofiane Achiche","Drones are increasingly used in fields like industry, medicine, research, disaster relief, defense, and security. Technical challenges, such as navigation in GPS-denied environments, hinder further adoption. Research in visual odometry is advancing, potentially solving GPS-free navigation issues. Traditional visual odometry methods use geometry-based pipelines which, while popular, often suffer from error accumulation and high computational demands. Recent studies utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown improved performance, addressing these drawbacks. Deep visual odometry typically employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and sequence modeling networks like recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to interpret scenes and deduce visual odometry from video sequences. This paper presents a novel real-time monocular visual odometry model for drones, using a deep neural architecture with a self-attention module. It estimates the ego-motion of a camera on a drone, using consecutive video frames. An inference utility processes the live video feed, employing deep learning to estimate the drone's trajectory. The architecture combines a CNN for image feature extraction and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network with a multi-head attention module for video sequence modeling. Tested on two visual odometry datasets, this model converged 48% faster than a previous RNN model and showed a 22% reduction in mean translational drift and a 12% improvement in mean translational absolute trajectory error, demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17745v1,,N,N,N,N
Airlift Challenge: A Competition for Optimizing Cargo Delivery,26/04/2024,"Adis Delanovic, Carmen Chiu, Andre Beckus","Airlift operations require the timely distribution of various cargo, much of which is time sensitive and valuable. However, these operations have to contend with sudden disruptions from weather and malfunctions, requiring immediate rescheduling. The Airlift Challenge competition seeks possible solutions via a simulator that provides a simplified abstraction of the airlift problem. The simulator uses an OpenAI gym interface that allows participants to create an algorithm for planning agent actions. The algorithm is scored using a remote evaluator against scenarios of ever-increasing difficulty. The second iteration of the competition was underway from November 2023 to April 2024.

This approach offers the low power and efficiency of an ASIC along with the ease of FPGA configuration, particularly beneficial for the use case of machine learning in the data pipeline of next-generation collider experiments. An open-source framework called ""FABulous"" was used to design eFPGAs using 130 nm and 28 nm CMOS technology nodes, which were subsequently fabricated and verified through testing. The capability of an eFPGA to act as a front-end readout chip was tested using simulation of high energy particles passing through a silicon pixel sensor. A machine learning-based classifier, designed for reduction of sensor data at the source, was synthesized and configured onto the eFPGA.

Probabilistic Inference in Language Models via Twisted Sequential Monte Carlo,26/04/2024,"Stephen Zhao, Rob Brekelmans, Alireza Makhzani, Roger Grosse","Numerous capability and safety techniques of Large Language Models (LLMs), including RLHF, automated red-teaming, prompt engineering, and infilling, can be cast as sampling from an unnormalized target distribution defined by a given reward or potential function over the full sequence. In this work, we leverage the rich toolkit of Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) for these probabilistic inference problems. In particular, we use learned twist functions to estimate the expected future value of the potential at each timestep, which enables us to focus inference-time computation on promising partial sequences. We propose a novel contrastive method for learning the twist functions, and establish connections with the rich literature of soft reinforcement learning. As a complementary application of our twisted SMC framework, we present methods for evaluating the accuracy of language model inference techniques using novel bidirectional SMC bounds on the log partition function. These bounds can be used to estimate the KL divergence between the inference and target distributions in both directions. We apply our inference evaluation techniques to show that twisted SMC is effective for sampling undesirable outputs from a pretrained model (a useful component of harmlessness training and automated red-teaming), generating reviews with varied sentiment, and performing infilling tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17546v1,,N,N,N,Y
Bayesian Federated Inference for Survival Models,26/04/2024,"Hassan Pazira, Emanuele Massa, Jetty AM Weijers, Anthony CC Coolen, Marianne A Jonker","In cancer research, overall survival and progression free survival are often analyzed with the Cox model. To estimate accurately the parameters in the model, sufficient data and, more importantly, sufficient events need to be observed. In practice, this is often a problem. Merging data sets from different medical centers may help, but this is not always possible due to strict privacy legislation and logistic difficulties. Recently, the Bayesian Federated Inference (BFI) strategy for generalized linear models was proposed. With this strategy the statistical analyses are performed in the local centers where the data were collected (or stored) and only the inference results are combined to a single estimated model; merging data is not necessary. The BFI methodology aims to compute from the separate inference results in the local centers what would have been obtained if the analysis had been based on the merged data sets. In this paper we generalize the BFI methodology as initially developed for generalized linear models to survival models. Simulation studies and real data analyses show excellent performance; i.e., the results obtained with the BFI methodology are very similar to the results obtained by analyzing the merged data. An R package for doing the analyses is available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17464v1,,N,N,N,N
Domain Adaptive and Fine-grained Anomaly Detection for Single-cell Sequencing Data and Beyond,26/04/2024,"Kaichen Xu, Yueyang Ding, Suyang Hou, Weiqiang Zhan, Nisang Chen, Jun Wang, Xiaobo Sun","Fined-grained anomalous cell detection from affected tissues is critical for clinical diagnosis and pathological research. Single-cell sequencing data provide unprecedented opportunities for this task. However, current anomaly detection methods struggle to handle domain shifts prevalent in multi-sample and multi-domain single-cell sequencing data, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, these methods fall short of distinguishing anomalous cells into pathologically distinct subtypes. In response, we propose ACSleuth, a novel, reconstruction deviation-guided generative framework that integrates the detection, domain adaptation, and fine-grained annotating of anomalous cells into a methodologically cohesive workflow. Notably, we present the first theoretical analysis of using reconstruction deviations output by generative models for anomaly detection in lieu of domain shifts. This analysis informs us to develop a novel and superior maximum mean discrepancy-based anomaly scorer in ACSleuth. Extensive benchmarks over various single-cell data and other types of tabular data demonstrate ACSleuth's superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in identifying and subtyping anomalies in multi-sample and multi-domain contexts.

In this paper, we propose a novel general approach for distributional forecasting capable of predicting arbitrary quantiles.

Existing learning-based methods construct subspaces by approximating pre-defined simulation data in a purely geometric way. However, this approach tends to produce high-energy configurations, leads to entangled latent space dimensions, and generalizes poorly beyond the training set. To overcome these limitations, we propose a self-supervised approach that directly minimizes the system's mechanical energy during training. We show that our method leads to learned subspaces that reflect physical equilibrium constraints, resolve overfitting issues of previous methods, and offer interpretable latent space parameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17620v1,,N,N,N,N
On the Road to Clarity: Exploring Explainable AI for World Models in a Driver Assistance System,26/04/2024,"Mohamed Roshdi, Julian Petzold, Mostafa Wahby, Hussein Ebrahim, Mladen Berekovic, Heiko Hamann","In Autonomous Driving (AD) transparency and safety are paramount, as mistakes are costly. However, neural networks used in AD systems are generally considered black boxes. As a countermeasure, we have methods of explainable AI (XAI), such as feature relevance estimation and dimensionality reduction. Coarse graining techniques can also help reduce dimensionality and find interpretable global patterns. A specific coarse graining method is Renormalization Groups from statistical physics. It has previously been applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) to interpret unsupervised learning. We refine this technique by building a transparent backbone model for convolutional variational autoencoders (VAE) that allows mapping latent values to input features and has performance comparable to trained black box VAEs. Moreover, we propose a custom feature map visualization technique to analyze the internal convolutional layers in the VAE to explain internal causes of poor reconstruction that may lead to dangerous traffic scenarios in AD applications. In a second key contribution, we propose explanation and evaluation techniques for the internal dynamics and feature relevance of prediction networks.

Efficient Deterministic Renewable Energy Forecasting Guided by Multiple-Location Weather Data,26/04/2024,"Charalampos Symeonidis, Nikos Nikolaidis","Electricity generated from renewable energy sources has been established as an efficient remedy for both energy shortages and the environmental pollution stemming from conventional energy production methods. Solar and wind power are two of the most dominant renewable energy sources. The accurate forecasting of the energy generation of those sources facilitates their integration into electric grids, by minimizing the negative impact of uncertainty regarding their management and operation. This paper proposes a novel methodology for deterministic wind and solar energy generation forecasting for multiple generation sites, utilizing multi-location weather forecasts. The method employs a U-shaped Temporal Convolutional Auto-Encoder (UTCAE) architecture for temporal processing of weather-related and energy-related time-series across each site. The Multi-sized Kernels convolutional Spatio-Temporal Attention (MKST-Attention), inspired by the multi-head scaled-dot product attention mechanism, is also proposed aiming to efficiently transfer temporal patterns from weather data to energy data, without a priori knowledge of the locations of the power stations and the locations of provided weather data.

MetaSD: A Unified Framework for Scalable Downscaling of Meteorological Variables in Diverse Situations,26/04/2024,"Jing Hu, Honghu Zhang, Peng Zheng, Jialin Mu, Xiaomeng Huang, Xi Wu","Addressing complex meteorological processes at a fine spatial resolution requires substantial computational resources. To accelerate meteorological simulations, researchers have utilized neural networks to downscale meteorological variables from low-resolution simulations. Despite notable advancements, contemporary cutting-edge downscaling algorithms tailored to specific variables. Addressing meteorological variables in isolation overlooks their interconnectedness, leading to an incomplete understanding of atmospheric dynamics. Additionally, the laborious processes of data collection, annotation, and computational resources required for individual variable downscaling are significant hurdles. Given the limited versatility of existing models across different meteorological variables and their failure to account for inter-variable relationships, this paper proposes a unified downscaling approach leveraging meta-learning. This framework aims to facilitate the downscaling of diverse meteorological variables derived from various numerical models and spatiotemporal scales. Trained at variables consisted of temperature, wind, surface pressure and total precipitation from ERA5 and GFS, the proposed method can be extended to downscale convective precipitation, potential energy, height, humidity and ozone from CFS, S2S and CMIP6 at different spatiotemporal scales, which demonstrating its capability to capture the interconnections among diverse variables. Our approach represents the initial effort to create a generalized downscaling model. Experimental evidence demonstrates that the proposed model outperforms existing top downscaling methods in both quantitative and qualitative assessments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17611v1,,N,N,N,N

In order to efficiently design and optimize the network, channel modeling plays a key role since FR3 systems are expected to operate at multiple frequency bands. Data-driven methods, especially generative adversarial networks (GANs), can capture the intricate relationships among data samples, and provide an appropriate tool for FR3 channel modeling. In this work, we present the architecture, link state model, and path generative network of GAN-based FR3 channel modeling.

Generative AI in Color-Changing Systems: Re-Programmable 3D Object Textures with Material and Design Constraints,25/04/2024,"Yunyi Zhu, Faraz Faruqi, Stefanie Mueller","Advances in Generative AI tools have allowed designers to manipulate existing 3D models using text or image-based prompts, enabling creators to explore different design goals. Photochromic color-changing systems, on the other hand, allow for the reprogramming of surface texture of 3D models, enabling easy customization of physical objects and opening up the possibility of using object surfaces for data display. However, existing photochromic systems require the user to manually design the desired texture, inspect the simulation of the pattern on the object, and verify the efficacy of the generated pattern. These manual design, inspection, and verification steps prevent the user from efficiently exploring the design space of possible patterns. Thus, by designing an automated workflow desired for an end-to-end texture application process, we can allow rapid iteration on different practicable patterns. In this workshop paper, we discuss the possibilities of extending generative AI systems, with material and design constraints for reprogrammable surfaces with photochromic materials. By constraining generative AI systems to colors and materials possible to be physically realized with photochromic dyes, we can create tools that would allow users to explore different viable patterns, with text and image-based prompts. We identify two focus areas in this topic: photochromic material constraints and design constraints for data-encoded textures. We highlight the current limitations of using generative AI tools to create viable textures using photochromic material. Finally, we present possible approaches to augment generative AI methods to take into account the photochromic material constraints, allowing for the creation of viable photochromic textures rapidly and easily.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.17028v1,,N,N,N,N
On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Forecasting with Deep Learning,25/04/2024,"Vitor Cerqueira, Mois√©s Santos, Yassine Baghoussi, Carlos Soares","Deep learning approaches are increasingly used to tackle forecasting tasks. A key factor in the successful application of these methods is a large enough training sample size, which is not always available. In these scenarios, synthetic data generation techniques are usually applied to augment the dataset. Data augmentation is typically applied before fitting a model. However, these approaches create a single augmented dataset, potentially limiting their effectiveness. This work introduces OnDAT (On-the-fly Data Augmentation for Time series) to address this issue by applying data augmentation during training and validation. Contrary to traditional methods that create a single, static augmented dataset beforehand, OnDAT performs augmentation on-the-fly. By generating a new augmented dataset on each iteration, the model is exposed to a constantly changing augmented data variations. We hypothesize this process enables a better exploration of the data space, which reduces the potential for overfitting and improves forecasting performance. We validated the proposed approach using a state-of-the-art deep learning forecasting method and 8 benchmark datasets containing a total of 75797 time series. The experiments suggest that OnDAT leads to better forecasting performance than a strategy that applies data augmentation before training as well as a strategy that does not involve data augmentation. The method and experiments are publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16918v1,,Y,N,N,Y
"Formal Specification, Assessment, and Enforcement of Fairness for Generative AIs",25/04/2024,"Chih-Hong Cheng, Changshun Wu, Harald Ruess, Xingyu Zhao, Saddek Bensalem","Reinforcing or even exacerbating societal biases and inequalities will increase significantly as generative AI increasingly produces useful artifacts, from text to images and beyond, for the real world. We address these issues by formally characterizing the notion of fairness for generative AI as a basis for monitoring and enforcing fairness. We define two levels of fairness using the notion of infinite sequences of abstractions of AI-generated artifacts such as text or images. The first is the fairness demonstrated on the generated sequences, which is evaluated only on the outputs while agnostic to the prompts and models used. The second is the inherent fairness of the generative AI model, which requires that fairness be manifested when input prompts are neutral, that is, they do not explicitly instruct the generative AI to produce a particular type of output. We also study relative intersectional fairness to counteract the combinatorial explosion of fairness when considering multiple categories together with lazy fairness enforcement. Finally, fairness monitoring and enforcement are tested against some current generative AI models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16663v2,,N,N,N,N
A Self-Organizing Clustering System for Unsupervised Distribution Shift Detection,25/04/2024,"Sebasti√°n Basterrech, Line Clemmensen, Gerardo Rubino","Modeling non-stationary data is a challenging problem in the field of continual learning, and data distribution shifts may result in negative consequences on the performance of a machine learning model. Classic learning tools are often vulnerable to perturbations of the input covariates, and are sensitive to outliers and noise, and some tools are based on rigid algebraic assumptions. Distribution shifts are frequently occurring due to changes in raw materials for production, seasonality, a different user base, or even adversarial attacks. Therefore, there is a need for more effective distribution shift detection techniques. In this work, we propose a continual learning framework for monitoring and detecting distribution changes. We explore the problem in a latent space generated by a bio-inspired self-organizing clustering and statistical aspects of the latent space. In particular, we investigate the projections made by two topology-preserving maps: the Self-Organizing Map and the Scale Invariant Map. Our method can be applied in both a supervised and an unsupervised context. We construct the assessment of changes in the data distribution as a comparison of Gaussian signals, making the proposed method fast and robust. We compare it to other unsupervised techniques, specifically Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Kernel-PCA. Our comparison involves conducting experiments using sequences of images (based on MNIST and injected shifts with adversarial samples), chemical sensor measurements, and the environmental variable related to ozone levels.

Application of RESNET50 Convolution Neural Network for the Extraction of Optical Parameters in Scattering Media,25/04/2024,"Bowen Deng, Yihan Zhang, Andrew Parkes, Alex Bentley, Amanda Wright, Michael Pound, Michael Somekh","Estimation of the optical properties of scattering media such as tissue is important in diagnostics as well as in the development of techniques to image deeper. As light penetrates the sample scattering events occur that alter the propagation direction of the photons in a random manner leading degradation of image quality. The distribution of the scattered light does, however, give a measure of the optical properties such as the reduced scattering coefficient and the absorption coefficient. Unfortunately, inverting scattering patterns to recover the optical properties is not simple, especially in the regime where the light is partially randomized. Machine learning has been proposed by several authors as a means of recovering these properties from either the back scattered or the transmitted light. In the present paper, we train a general purpose convolutional neural network RESNET 50 with simulated data based on Monte Carlo simulations. We show that compared with previous work our approach gives comparable or better reconstruction accuracy with training on a much smaller dataset. Moreover, by training on multiple parameters such as the intensity distribution at multiple planes or the exit angle and spatial distribution one achieves improved performance compared to training on a single input such as the intensity distribution captured at the sample surface. While our approach gives good parameter reconstruction, we identify factors that limit the accuracy of the recovered properties, particularly the absorption coefficient. In the light of these limitations, we suggest how the present approach may be enhanced for even better performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16647v1,,N,N,N,N
HEroBM: a deep equivariant graph neural network for universal backmapping from coarse-grained to all-atom representations,25/04/2024,"Daniele Angioletti, Stefano Raniolo, Vittorio Limongelli","Molecular simulations have assumed a paramount role in the fields of chemistry, biology, and material sciences, being able to capture the intricate dynamic properties of systems. Within this realm, coarse-grained (CG) techniques have emerged as invaluable tools to sample large-scale systems and reach extended timescales by simplifying system representation. However, CG approaches come with a trade-off: they sacrifice atomistic details that might hold significant relevance in deciphering the investigated process. Therefore, a recommended approach is to identify key CG conformations and process them using backmapping methods, which retrieve atomistic coordinates. Currently, rule-based methods yield subpar geometries and rely on energy relaxation, resulting in less-than-optimal outcomes. Conversely, machine learning techniques offer higher accuracy but are either limited in transferability between systems or tied to specific CG mappings. In this work, we introduce HEroBM, a dynamic and scalable method that employs deep equivariant graph neural networks and a hierarchical approach to achieve high-resolution backmapping. HEroBM handles any type of CG mapping, offering a versatile and efficient protocol for reconstructing atomistic structures with high accuracy. Focused on local principles, HEroBM spans the entire chemical space and is transferable to systems of varying sizes. We illustrate the versatility of our framework through diverse biological systems, including a complex real-case scenario. Here, our end-to-end backmapping approach accurately generates the atomistic coordinates of a G protein-coupled receptor bound to an organic small molecule within a cholesterol/phospholipid bilayer.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16911v1,,N,N,N,N

Ordinal classification is common in real applications where the target variable has natural ordering among the class labels. In this paper, we discuss constructing distribution-free prediction sets for such ordinal classification problems by leveraging the ideas of conformal prediction and multiple testing with FWER control. Newer conformal prediction methods are developed for constructing contiguous and non-contiguous prediction sets based on marginal and conditional (class-specific) conformal $p$-values, respectively. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed methods respectively achieve satisfactory levels of marginal and class-specific conditional coverages.

Energy-Latency Manipulation of Multi-modal Large Language Models via Verbose Samples,25/04/2024,"Kuofeng Gao, Jindong Gu, Yang Bai, Shu-Tao Xia, Philip Torr, Wei Liu, Zhifeng Li","Despite the exceptional performance of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs), their deployment requires substantial computational resources. Once malicious users induce high energy consumption and latency time (energy-latency cost), it will exhaust computational resources and harm availability of service. In this paper, we investigate this vulnerability for MLLMs, particularly image-based and video-based ones, and aim to induce high energy-latency cost during inference by crafting an imperceptible perturbation. We find that high energy-latency cost can be manipulated by maximizing the length of generated sequences, which motivates us to propose verbose samples, including verbose images and videos. Concretely, two modality non-specific losses are proposed, including a loss to delay end-of-sequence (EOS) token and an uncertainty loss to increase the uncertainty over each generated token. In addition, improving diversity is important to encourage longer responses by increasing the complexity, which inspires the following modality specific loss. For verbose images, a token diversity loss is proposed to promote diverse hidden states. For verbose videos, a frame feature diversity loss is proposed to increase the feature diversity among frames. To balance these losses, we propose a temporal weight adjustment algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that our verbose samples can largely extend the length of generated sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16557v1,,N,N,N,N

In the absence of analytical models and due to the complexity of the scour process, it is difficult for current empirical methods to achieve accurate predictions. In this paper, we exploit the power of deep learning algorithms to forecast the scour depth variations around bridge piers based on historical sensor monitoring data, including riverbed elevation, flow elevation, and flow velocity. We investigated the performance of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models for real-time scour forecasting using data collected from bridges in Alaska and Oregon from 2006 to 2021. The LSTM models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) ranging from 0.1m to 0.5m for predicting bed level variations a week in advance, showing a reasonable performance. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) variant of CNN outperformed other CNN configurations, showing a comparable performance to LSTMs with significantly lower computational costs. We explored various innovative random-search heuristics for hyperparameter tuning and model optimisation which resulted in reduced computational cost compared to grid-search method. The impact of different combinations of sensor features on scour prediction showed the significance of the historical time series of scour for predicting upcoming events. Overall, this study provides a greater understanding of the potential of Deep Learning (DL) for real-time scour forecasting and early warning in bridges with diverse scour and flow characteristics including riverine and tidal/coastal bridges.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16549v1,,N,N,N,N

In this work, we investigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training that could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively experiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and with different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g. sequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead to hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling objective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct pruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language modeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint existence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization behaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear order). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover transformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a correlation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset and whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a hierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16367v1,,N,N,N,Y
Bi-Mamba4TS: Bidirectional Mamba for Time Series Forecasting,24/04/2024,"Aobo Liang, Xingguo Jiang, Yan Sun, Chang Lu","Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) provides longer insights into future trends and patterns. In recent years, deep learning models especially Transformers have achieved advanced performance in LTSF tasks. However, the quadratic complexity of Transformers rises the challenge of balancing computaional efficiency and predicting performance. Recently, a new state space model (SSM) named Mamba is proposed. With the selective capability on input data and the hardware-aware parallel computing algorithm, Mamba can well capture long-term dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Mamba has shown great ability for long sequence modeling and is a potential competitor to Transformer-based models in LTSF. In this paper, we propose Bi-Mamba4TS, a bidirectional Mamba for time series forecasting. To address the sparsity of time series semantics, we adopt the patching technique to enrich the local information while capturing the evolutionary patterns of time series in a finer granularity. To select more appropriate modeling method based on the characteristics of the dataset, our model unifies the channel-independent and channel-mixing tokenization strategies and uses a series-relation-aware decider to control the strategy choosing process. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets show that our model achieves more accurate predictions compared with state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15772v1,,N,N,N,Y
Estimating the Distribution of Parameters in Differential Equations with Repeated Cross-Sectional Data,23/04/2024,"Hyeontae Jo, Sung Woong Cho, Hyung Ju Hwang","Differential equations are pivotal in modeling and understanding the dynamics of various systems, offering insights into their future states through parameter estimation fitted to time series data. In fields such as economy, politics, and biology, the observation data points in the time series are often independently obtained (i.e., Repeated Cross-Sectional (RCS) data). With RCS data, we found that traditional methods for parameter estimation in differential equations, such as using mean values of time trajectories or Gaussian Process-based trajectory generation, have limitations in estimating the shape of parameter distributions, often leading to a significant loss of data information. To address this issue, we introduce a novel method, Estimation of Parameter Distribution (EPD), providing accurate distribution of parameters without loss of data information. EPD operates in three main steps: generating synthetic time trajectories by randomly selecting observed values at each time point, estimating parameters of a differential equation that minimize the discrepancy between these trajectories and the true solution of the equation, and selecting the parameters depending on the scale of discrepancy. We then evaluated the performance of EPD across several models, including exponential growth, logistic population models, and target cell-limited models with delayed virus production, demonstrating its superiority in capturing the shape of parameter distributions. Furthermore, we applied EPD to real-world datasets, capturing various shapes of parameter distributions rather than a normal distribution. These results effectively address the heterogeneity within systems, marking a substantial progression in accurately modeling systems using RCS data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14873v1,,N,N,N,Y
Dynamically Anchored Prompting for Task-Imbalanced Continual Learning,23/04/2024,"Chenxing Hong, Yan Jin, Zhiqi Kang, Yizhou Chen, Mengke Li, Yang Lu, Hanzi Wang","Existing continual learning literature relies heavily on a strong assumption that tasks arrive with a balanced data stream, which is often unrealistic in real-world applications. In this work, we explore task-imbalanced continual learning (TICL) scenarios where the distribution of task data is non-uniform across the whole learning process. We find that imbalanced tasks significantly challenge the capability of models to control the trade-off between stability and plasticity from the perspective of recent prompt-based continual learning methods. On top of the above finding, we propose Dynamically Anchored Prompting (DAP), a prompt-based method that only maintains a single general prompt to adapt to the shifts within a task stream dynamically. This general prompt is regularized in the prompt space with two specifically designed prompt anchors, called boosting anchor and stabilizing anchor, to balance stability and plasticity in TICL. Remarkably, DAP achieves this balance by only storing a prompt across the data stream, therefore offering a substantial advantage in rehearsal-free CL. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DAP results in 4.5% to 15% absolute improvements over state-of-the-art methods on benchmarks under task-imbalanced settings.

FMint: Bridging Human Designed and Data Pretrained Models for Differential Equation Foundation Model,23/04/2024,"Zezheng Song, Jiaxin Yuan, Haizhao Yang","Human-designed algorithms have long been fundamental in solving a variety of scientific and engineering challenges. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods have also risen to prominence, offering innovative solutions across numerous scientific fields. While traditional algorithms excel in capturing the core aspects of specific problems, they often lack the flexibility needed for varying problem conditions due to the absence of specific data. Conversely, while data-driven approaches utilize vast datasets, they frequently fall short in domain-specific knowledge. To bridge these gaps, we introduce \textbf{FMint} (Foundation Model based on Initialization), a generative pre-trained model that synergizes the precision of human-designed algorithms with the adaptability of data-driven methods. This model is specifically engineered for high-accuracy simulation of dynamical systems. Starting from initial trajectories provided by conventional methods, FMint quickly delivers highly accurate solutions. It incorporates in-context learning and has been pre-trained on a diverse corpus of 500,000 dynamical systems, showcasing exceptional generalization across a broad spectrum of real-world applications. By effectively combining algorithmic rigor with data-driven flexibility, FMint sets the stage for the next generation of scientific foundation models, tackling complex problems with both efficiency and high accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14688v1,,N,N,N,Y
NExT: Teaching Large Language Models to Reason about Code Execution,23/04/2024,"Ansong Ni, Miltiadis Allamanis, Arman Cohan, Yinlin Deng, Kensen Shi, Charles Sutton, Pengcheng Yin","A fundamental skill among human developers is the ability to understand and reason about program execution. As an example, a programmer can mentally simulate code execution in natural language to debug and repair code (aka. rubber duck debugging). However, large language models (LLMs) of code are typically trained on the surface textual form of programs, thus may lack a semantic understanding of how programs execute at run-time. To address this issue, we propose NExT, a method to teach LLMs to inspect the execution traces of programs (variable states of executed lines) and reason about their run-time behavior through chain-of-thought (CoT) rationales. Specifically, NExT uses self-training to bootstrap a synthetic training set of execution-aware rationales that lead to correct task solutions (e.g., fixed programs) without laborious manual annotation. Experiments on program repair tasks based on MBPP and HumanEval demonstrate that NExT improves the fix rate of a PaLM 2 model, by 26.1% and 14.3% absolute, respectively, with significantly improved rationale quality as verified by automated metrics and human raters. Our model can also generalize to scenarios where program traces are absent at test-time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14662v1,,N,N,N,N
Fourier Series Guided Design of Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks for Enhanced Time Series Forecasting,23/04/2024,"Sandra Leticia Ju√°rez Osorio, Mayra Alejandra Rivera Ruiz, Andres Mendez-Vazquez, Eduardo Rodriguez-Tello","In this study, we apply 1D quantum convolution to address the task of time series forecasting. By encoding multiple points into the quantum circuit to predict subsequent data, each point becomes a feature, transforming the problem into a multidimensional one. Building on theoretical foundations from prior research, which demonstrated that Variational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) can be expressed as multidimensional Fourier series, we explore the capabilities of different architectures and ansatz. This analysis considers the concepts of circuit expressibility and the presence of barren plateaus. Analyzing the problem within the framework of the Fourier series enabled the design of an architecture that incorporates data reuploading, resulting in enhanced performance. Rather than a strict requirement for the number of free parameters to exceed the degrees of freedom of the Fourier series, our findings suggest that even a limited number of parameters can produce Fourier functions of higher degrees. This highlights the remarkable expressive power of quantum circuits. This observation is also significant in reducing training times. The ansatz with greater expressibility and number of non-zero Fourier coefficients consistently delivers favorable results across different scenarios, with performance metrics improving as the number of qubits increases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.15377v2,,N,N,N,Y
Multidimensional Interpolants,22/04/2024,"Dohoon Lee, Kyogu Lee","In the domain of differential equation-based generative modeling, conventional approaches often rely on single-dimensional scalar values as interpolation coefficients during both training and inference phases. In this work, we introduce, for the first time, a multidimensional interpolant that extends these coefficients into multiple dimensions, leveraging the stochastic interpolant framework. Additionally, we propose a novel path optimization problem tailored to adaptively determine multidimensional inference trajectories, with a predetermined differential equation solver and a fixed number of function evaluations. Our solution involves simulation dynamics coupled with adversarial training to optimize the inference path. Notably, employing a multidimensional interpolant during training improves the model's inference performance, even in the absence of path optimization. When the adaptive, multidimensional path derived from our optimization process is employed, it yields further performance gains, even with fixed solver configurations. The introduction of multidimensional interpolants not only enhances the efficacy of models but also opens up a new domain for exploration in training and inference methodologies, emphasizing the potential of multidimensional paths as an untapped frontier.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14161v1,,N,N,N,N
Stochastic Volatility in Mean: Efficient Analysis by a Generalized Mixture Sampler,22/04/2024,"Daichi Hiraki, Siddhartha Chib, Yasuhiro Omori","In this paper we consider the simulation-based Bayesian analysis of stochastic volatility in mean (SVM) models. Extending the highly efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo mixture sampler for the SV model proposed in Kim et al. (1998) and Omori et al. (2007), we develop an accurate approximation of the non-central chi-squared distribution as a mixture of thirty normal distributions. Under this mixture representation, we sample the parameters and latent volatilities in one block. We also detail a correction of the small approximation error by using additional Metropolis-Hastings steps. The proposed method is extended to the SVM model with leverage. The methodology and models are applied to excess holding yields in empirical studies, and the SVM model with leverage is shown to outperform competing volatility models based on marginal likelihoods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.13986v1,,N,N,N,N
Social Media Use is Predictable from App Sequences: Using LSTM and Transformer Neural Networks to Model Habitual Behavior,20/04/2024,"Heinrich Peters, Joseph B. Bayer, Sandra C. Matz, Yikun Chi, Sumer S. Vaid, Gabriella M. Harari","The present paper introduces a novel approach to studying social media habits through predictive modeling of sequential smartphone user behaviors. While much of the literature on media and technology habits has relied on self-report questionnaires and simple behavioral frequency measures, we examine an important yet understudied aspect of media and technology habits: their embeddedness in repetitive behavioral sequences. Leveraging Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and transformer neural networks, we show that (i) social media use is predictable at the within and between-person level and that (ii) there are robust individual differences in the predictability of social media use. We examine the performance of several modeling approaches, including (i) global models trained on the pooled data from all participants, (ii) idiographic person-specific models, and (iii) global models fine-tuned on person-specific data. Neither person-specific modeling nor fine-tuning on person-specific data substantially outperformed the global models, indicating that the global models were able to represent a variety of idiosyncratic behavioral patterns. Additionally, our analyses reveal that the person-level predictability of social media use is not substantially related to the frequency of smartphone use in general or the frequency of social media use, indicating that our approach captures an aspect of habits that is distinct from behavioral frequency. Implications for habit modeling and theoretical development are discussed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16066v1,,N,N,N,Y
A Novel A.I Enhanced Reservoir Characterization with a Combined Mixture of Experts -- NVIDIA Modulus based Physics Informed Neural Operator Forward Model,20/04/2024,"Clement Etienam, Yang Juntao, Issam Said, Oleg Ovcharenko, Kaustubh Tangsali, Pavel Dimitrov, Ken Hester","We have developed an advanced workflow for reservoir characterization, effectively addressing the challenges of reservoir history matching through a novel approach. This method integrates a Physics Informed Neural Operator (PINO) as a forward model within a sophisticated Cluster Classify Regress (CCR) framework. The process is enhanced by an adaptive Regularized Ensemble Kalman Inversion (aREKI), optimized for rapid uncertainty quantification in reservoir history matching. This innovative workflow parameterizes unknown permeability and porosity fields, capturing non-Gaussian posterior measures with techniques such as a variational convolution autoencoder and the CCR. Serving as exotic priors and a supervised model, the CCR synergizes with the PINO surrogate to accurately simulate the nonlinear dynamics of Peaceman well equations. The CCR approach allows for flexibility in applying distinct machine learning algorithms across its stages. Updates to the PINO reservoir surrogate are driven by a loss function derived from supervised data, initial conditions, and residuals of governing black oil PDEs. Our integrated model, termed PINO-Res-Sim, outputs crucial parameters including pressures, saturations, and production rates for oil, water, and gas. Validated against traditional simulators through controlled experiments on synthetic reservoirs and the Norne field, the methodology showed remarkable accuracy. Additionally, the PINO-Res-Sim in the aREKI workflow efficiently recovered unknown fields with a computational speedup of 100 to 6000 times faster than conventional methods. The learning phase for PINO-Res-Sim, conducted on an NVIDIA H100, was impressively efficient, compatible with ensemble-based methods for complex computational tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14447v1,,N,N,N,N

Neural Flow Diffusion Models: Learnable Forward Process for Improved Diffusion Modelling,19/04/2024,"Grigory Bartosh, Dmitry Vetrov, Christian A. Naesseth","Conventional diffusion models typically relies on a fixed forward process, which implicitly defines complex marginal distributions over latent variables. This can often complicate the reverse process' task in learning generative trajectories, and results in costly inference for diffusion models. To address these limitations, we introduce Neural Flow Diffusion Models (NFDM), a novel framework that enhances diffusion models by supporting a broader range of forward processes beyond the fixed linear Gaussian. We also propose a novel parameterization technique for learning the forward process. Our framework provides an end-to-end, simulation-free optimization objective, effectively minimizing a variational upper bound on the negative log-likelihood. Experimental results demonstrate NFDM's strong performance, evidenced by state-of-the-art likelihood estimation. Furthermore, we investigate NFDM's capacity for learning generative dynamics with specific characteristics, such as deterministic straight lines trajectories.

In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have shown a powerful performance in image generation as well as translation, rendering them a smart choice to be applied to reconstruction tasks. In this study, we proposed an end-to-end method called DensePANet to solve the problem of PAT image reconstruction from sparse data.

SOPHON: Non-Fine-Tunable Learning to Restrain Task Transferability For Pre-trained Models,19/04/2024,"Jiangyi Deng, Shengyuan Pang, Yanjiao Chen, Liangming Xia, Yijie Bai, Haiqin Weng, Wenyuan Xu","Instead of building deep learning models from scratch, developers are more and more relying on adapting pre-trained models to their customized tasks. However, powerful pre-trained models may be misused for unethical or illegal tasks, e.g., privacy inference and unsafe content generation. In this paper, we introduce a pioneering learning paradigm, non-fine-tunable learning, which prevents the pre-trained model from being fine-tuned to indecent tasks while preserving its performance on the original task. To fulfill this goal, we propose SOPHON, a protection framework that reinforces a given pre-trained model to be resistant to being fine-tuned in pre-defined restricted domains. Nonetheless, this is challenging due to a diversity of complicated fine-tuning strategies that may be adopted by adversaries. Inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning, we overcome this difficulty by designing sophisticated fine-tuning simulation and fine-tuning evaluation algorithms. In addition, we carefully design the optimization process to entrap the pre-trained model within a hard-to-escape local optimum regarding restricted domains. We have conducted extensive experiments on two deep learning modes (classification and generation), seven restricted domains, and six model architectures to verify the effectiveness of SOPHON. Experiment results verify that fine-tuning SOPHON-protected models incurs an overhead comparable to or even greater than training from scratch. Furthermore, we confirm the robustness of SOPHON to three fine-tuning methods, five optimizers, various learning rates and batch sizes. SOPHON may help boost further investigations into safe and responsible AI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12699v1,,N,N,N,N
Improving Chinese Character Representation with Formation Tree,19/04/2024,"Yang Hong, Yinfei Li, Xiaojun Qiao, Rui Li, Junsong Zhang","Learning effective representations for Chinese characters presents unique challenges, primarily due to the vast number of characters and their continuous growth, which requires models to handle an expanding category space. Additionally, the inherent sparsity of character usage complicates the generalization of learned representations. Prior research has explored radical-based sequences to overcome these issues, achieving progress in recognizing unseen characters. However, these approaches fail to fully exploit the inherent tree structure of such sequences. To address these limitations and leverage established data properties, we propose Formation Tree-CLIP (FT-CLIP). This model utilizes formation trees to represent characters and incorporates a dedicated tree encoder, significantly improving performance in both seen and unseen character recognition tasks. We further introduce masking for to both character images and tree nodes, enabling efficient and effective training. This approach accelerates training significantly (by a factor of 2 or more) while enhancing accuracy. Extensive experiments show that processing characters through formation trees aligns better with their inherent properties than direct sequential methods, significantly enhancing the generality and usability of the representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12693v1,,N,N,N,N
Continuous-time Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning via Quadratic Variation Penalty,19/04/2024,Yanwei Jia,"This paper studies continuous-time risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RL) under the entropy-regularized, exploratory diffusion process formulation with the exponential-form objective. The risk-sensitive objective arises either as the agent's risk attitude or as a distributionally robust approach against the model uncertainty. Owing to the martingale perspective in Jia and Zhou (2023) the risk-sensitive RL problem is shown to be equivalent to ensuring the martingale property of a process involving both the value function and the q-function, augmented by an additional penalty term: the quadratic variation of the value process, capturing the variability of the value-to-go along the trajectory. This characterization allows for the straightforward adaptation of existing RL algorithms developed for non-risk-sensitive scenarios to incorporate risk sensitivity by adding the realized variance of the value process. Additionally, I highlight that the conventional policy gradient representation is inadequate for risk-sensitive problems due to the nonlinear nature of quadratic variation; however, q-learning offers a solution and extends to infinite horizon settings. Finally, I prove the convergence of the proposed algorithm for Merton's investment problem and quantify the impact of temperature parameter on the behavior of the learning procedure. I also conduct simulation experiments to demonstrate how risk-sensitive RL improves the finite-sample performance in the linear-quadratic control problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12598v1,,N,N,N,N
Parameter Efficient Diverse Paraphrase Generation Using Sequence-Level Knowledge Distillation,19/04/2024,"Lasal Jayawardena, Prasan Yapa","Over the past year, the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has experienced an exponential surge, largely due to the introduction of Large Language Models (LLMs). These models have exhibited the most effective performance in a range of domains within the Natural Language Processing and Generation domains. However, their application in domain-specific tasks, such as paraphrasing, presents significant challenges. The extensive number of parameters makes them difficult to operate on commercial hardware, and they require substantial time for inference, leading to high costs in a production setting. In this study, we tackle these obstacles by employing LLMs to develop three distinct models for the paraphrasing field, applying a method referred to as sequence-level knowledge distillation. These distilled models are capable of maintaining the quality of paraphrases generated by the LLM. They demonstrate faster inference times and the ability to generate diverse paraphrases of comparable quality. A notable characteristic of these models is their ability to exhibit syntactic diversity while also preserving lexical diversity, features previously uncommon due to existing data quality issues in datasets and not typically observed in neural-based approaches. Human evaluation of our models shows that there is only a 4% drop in performance compared to the LLM teacher model used in the distillation process, despite being 1000 times smaller. This research provides a significant contribution to the NLG field, offering a more efficient and cost-effective solution for paraphrasing tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12596v1,10.1109/ICACS60934.2024.10473289,N,N,N,N
HalluciBot: Is There No Such Thing as a Bad Question?,18/04/2024,"William Watson, Nicole Cho","Hallucination continues to be one of the most critical challenges in the institutional adoption journey of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this context, an overwhelming number of studies have focused on analyzing the post-generation phase - refining outputs via feedback, analyzing logit output values, or deriving clues via the outputs' artifacts. We propose HalluciBot, a model that predicts the probability of hallucination $\textbf{before generation}$, for any query imposed to an LLM. In essence, HalluciBot does not invoke any generation during inference. To derive empirical evidence for HalluciBot, we employ a Multi-Agent Monte Carlo Simulation using a Query Perturbator to craft $n$ variations per query at train time. The construction of our Query Perturbator is motivated by our introduction of a new definition of hallucination - $\textit{truthful hallucination}$. Our training methodology generated 2,219,022 estimates for a training corpus of 369,837 queries, spanning 13 diverse datasets and 3 question-answering scenarios. HalluciBot predicts both binary and multi-class probabilities of hallucination, enabling a means to judge the query's quality with regards to its propensity to hallucinate. Therefore, HalluciBot paves the way to revise or cancel a query before generation and the ensuing computational waste. Moreover, it provides a lucid means to measure user accountability for hallucinatory queries.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12535v1,,N,N,N,N
NLP-enabled trajectory map-matching in urban road networks using transformer sequence-to-sequence model,18/04/2024,"Sevin Mohammadi, Andrew W. Smyth","Large-scale geolocation telematics data acquired from connected vehicles has the potential to significantly enhance mobility infrastructures and operational systems within smart cities. To effectively utilize this data, it is essential to accurately match the geolocation data to the road segments. However, this matching is often not trivial due to the low sampling rate and errors exacerbated by multipath effects in urban environments. Traditionally, statistical modeling techniques such as Hidden-Markov models incorporating domain knowledge into the matching process have been extensively used for map-matching tasks. However, rule-based map-matching tasks are noise-sensitive and inefficient in processing large-scale trajectory data. Deep learning techniques directly learn the relationship between observed data and road networks from the data, often without the need for hand-crafted rules or domain knowledge. This renders them an efficient approach for map-matching large-scale datasets and makes them more robust to the noise. This paper introduces a sequence-to-sequence deep-learning model, specifically the transformer-based encoder-decoder model, to perform as a surrogate for map-matching algorithms. The encoder-decoder architecture initially encodes the series of noisy GPS points into a representation that automatically captures autoregressive behavior and spatial correlations between GPS points. Subsequently, the decoder associates data points with the road network features and thus transforms these representations into a sequence of road segments. The model is trained and evaluated using GPS traces collected in Manhattan, New York. Achieving an accuracy of 76%, transformer-based encoder-decoder models extensively employed in natural language processing presented a promising performance for translating noisy GPS data to the navigated routes in urban road networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12460v1,,N,N,N,Y

However, RAG introduces long sequence generation and leads to high computation and memory costs. We propose RAGCache, a novel multilevel dynamic caching system tailored for RAG. Our analysis benchmarks current RAG systems, pinpointing the performance bottleneck (i.e., long sequence due to knowledge injection) and optimization opportunities (i.e., caching knowledge's intermediate states). Based on these insights, we design RAGCache, which organizes the intermediate states of retrieved knowledge in a knowledge tree and caches them in the GPU and host memory hierarchy. RAGCache proposes a replacement policy that is aware of LLM inference characteristics and RAG retrieval patterns. It also dynamically overlaps the retrieval and inference steps to minimize the end-to-end latency. We implement RAGCache and evaluate it on vLLM, a state-of-the-art LLM inference system and Faiss, a state-of-the-art vector database. The experimental results show that RAGCache reduces the time to first token (TTFT) by up to 4x and improves the throughput by up to 2.1x compared to vLLM integrated with Faiss.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12457v2,,N,N,N,N
Lazy Diffusion Transformer for Interactive Image Editing,18/04/2024,"Yotam Nitzan, Zongze Wu, Richard Zhang, Eli Shechtman, Daniel Cohen-Or, Taesung Park, Micha√´l Gharbi","We introduce a novel diffusion transformer, LazyDiffusion, that generates partial image updates efficiently. Our approach targets interactive image editing applications in which, starting from a blank canvas or an image, a user specifies a sequence of localized image modifications using binary masks and text prompts. Our generator operates in two phases. First, a context encoder processes the current canvas and user mask to produce a compact global context tailored to the region to generate. Second, conditioned on this context, a diffusion-based transformer decoder synthesizes the masked pixels in a ""lazy"" fashion, i.e., it only generates the masked region. This contrasts with previous works that either regenerate the full canvas, wasting time and computation, or confine processing to a tight rectangular crop around the mask, ignoring the global image context altogether. Our decoder's runtime scales with the mask size, which is typically small, while our encoder introduces negligible overhead. We demonstrate that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art inpainting methods in terms of quality and fidelity while providing a 10x speedup for typical user interactions, where the editing mask represents 10% of the image.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12382v1,,N,N,N,N
"Information theory unifies atomistic machine learning, uncertainty quantification, and materials thermodynamics",18/04/2024,"Daniel Schwalbe-Koda, Sebastien Hamel, Babak Sadigh, Fei Zhou, Vincenzo Lordi","An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic modeling, such as sampling methods, detecting rare events, analyzing datasets, or performing uncertainty quantification (UQ) in machine learning (ML)-driven simulations. Although individual methods have been proposed for each of these tasks, they lack a common theoretical background integrating their solutions. Here, we introduce an information theoretical framework that unifies predictions of phase transformations, kinetic events, dataset optimality, and model-free UQ from atomistic simulations, thus bridging materials modeling, ML, and statistical mechanics. We first demonstrate that, for a proposed representation, the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments is a surrogate value for thermodynamic entropy. Using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we show that information entropy differences from trajectories can be used to build phase diagrams, identify rare events, and recover classical theories of nucleation. Building on these results, we use this general concept of entropy to quantify information in datasets for ML interatomic potentials (IPs), informing compression, explaining trends in testing errors, and evaluating the efficiency of active learning strategies. Finally, we propose a model-free UQ method for MLIPs using information entropy, showing it reliably detects extrapolation regimes, scales to millions of atoms, and goes beyond model errors.

The anomaly detection approach presented in this paper consists of three stages.The first stage identifies the repetitive cycles in the lengthy time series and segments them into individual time series corresponding to one task cycle, while accounting for possible temporal distortions.The second stage computes a prototype for the cycles using a GPU-based barycenter algorithm, specifically tailored for very large time series.The third stage uses the prototype to detect abnormal cycles by computing an anomaly score for each cycle.The overall approach, named WarpEd Time Series ANomaly Detection (WETSAND), makes use of the Dynamic Time Warping algorithm and its variants because they are suited to the distorted nature of the time series.The experiments show that \wetsand scales to large signals, computes human-friendly prototypes, works with very little data, and outperforms some general purpose anomaly detection approaches such as autoencoders.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12134v1,,N,N,N,Y
Personalized Forgetting Mechanism with Concept-Driven Knowledge Tracing,18/04/2024,"Shanshan Wang, Ying Hu, Xun Yang, Zhongzhou Zhang, Keyang Wang, Xingyi Zhang","Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to trace changes in students' knowledge states throughout their entire learning process by analyzing their historical learning data and predicting their future learning performance. Existing forgetting curve theory based knowledge tracing models only consider the general forgetting caused by time intervals, ignoring the individualization of students and the causal relationship of the forgetting process. To address these problems, we propose a Concept-driven Personalized Forgetting knowledge tracing model (CPF) which integrates hierarchical relationships between knowledge concepts and incorporates students' personalized cognitive abilities. First, we integrate the students' personalized capabilities into both the learning and forgetting processes to explicitly distinguish students' individual learning gains and forgetting rates according to their cognitive abilities. Second, we take into account the hierarchical relationships between knowledge points and design a precursor-successor knowledge concept matrix to simulate the causal relationship in the forgetting process, while also integrating the potential impact of forgetting prior knowledge points on subsequent ones. The proposed personalized forgetting mechanism can not only be applied to the learning of specifc knowledge concepts but also the life-long learning process. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets show that our CPF outperforms current forgetting curve theory based methods in predicting student performance, demonstrating CPF can better simulate changes in students' knowledge status through the personalized forgetting mechanism.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12127v2,,N,N,N,N
Functional Protein Design with Local Domain Alignment,18/04/2024,"Chaohao Yuan, Songyou Li, Geyan Ye, Yikun Zhang, Long-Kai Huang, Wenbing Huang, Wei Liu, Jianhua Yao, Yu Rong","The core challenge of de novo protein design lies in creating proteins with specific functions or properties, guided by certain conditions. Current models explore to generate protein using structural and evolutionary guidance, which only provide indirect conditions concerning functions and properties. However, textual annotations of proteins, especially the annotations for protein domains, which directly describe the protein's high-level functionalities, properties, and their correlation with target amino acid sequences, remain unexplored in the context of protein design tasks. In this paper, we propose Protein-Annotation Alignment Generation (PAAG), a multi-modality protein design framework that integrates the textual annotations extracted from protein database for controllable generation in sequence space. Specifically, within a multi-level alignment module, PAAG can explicitly generate proteins containing specific domains conditioned on the corresponding domain annotations, and can even design novel proteins with flexible combinations of different kinds of annotations. Our experimental results underscore the superiority of the aligned protein representations from PAAG over 7 prediction tasks. Furthermore, PAAG demonstrates a nearly sixfold increase in generation success rate (24.7% vs 4.7% in zinc finger, and 54.3% vs 8.7% in the immunoglobulin domain) in comparison to the existing model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16866v1,,N,N,N,Y
Multi-fidelity Gaussian process surrogate modeling for regression problems in physics,18/04/2024,"Kislaya Ravi, Vladyslav Fediukov, Felix Dietrich, Tobias Neckel, Fabian Buse, Michael Bergmann, Hans-Joachim Bungartz","One of the main challenges in surrogate modeling is the limited availability of data due to resource constraints associated with computationally expensive simulations. Multi-fidelity methods provide a solution by chaining models in a hierarchy with increasing fidelity, associated with lower error, but increasing cost. In this paper, we compare different multi-fidelity methods employed in constructing Gaussian process surrogates for regression. Non-linear autoregressive methods in the existing literature are primarily confined to two-fidelity models, and we extend these methods to handle more than two levels of fidelity. Additionally, we propose enhancements for an existing method incorporating delay terms by introducing a structured kernel. We demonstrate the performance of these methods across various academic and real-world scenarios. Our findings reveal that multi-fidelity methods generally have a smaller prediction error for the same computational cost as compared to the single-fidelity method, although their effectiveness varies across different scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11965v1,,N,N,N,N
Toward Short-Term Glucose Prediction Solely Based on CGM Time Series,18/04/2024,"Ming Cheng, Xingjian Diao, Ziyi Zhou, Yanjun Cui, Wenjun Liu, Shitong Cheng","The global diabetes epidemic highlights the importance of maintaining good glycemic control. Glucose prediction is a fundamental aspect of diabetes management, facilitating real-time decision-making. Recent research has introduced models focusing on long-term glucose trend prediction, which are unsuitable for real-time decision-making and result in delayed responses. Conversely, models designed to respond to immediate glucose level changes cannot analyze glucose variability comprehensively. Moreover, contemporary research generally integrates various physiological parameters (e.g. insulin doses, food intake, etc.), which inevitably raises data privacy concerns. To bridge such a research gap, we propose TimeGlu -- an end-to-end pipeline for short-term glucose prediction solely based on CGM time series data. We implement four baseline methods to conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis of the model's performance. Through extensive experiments on two contrasting datasets (CGM Glucose and Colas dataset), TimeGlu achieves state-of-the-art performance without the need for additional personal data from patients, providing effective guidance for real-world diabetic glucose management.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11924v1,,N,N,N,Y
Short-term wind speed forecasting model based on an attention-gated recurrent neural network and error correction strategy,17/04/2024,Haojian Huang,"The accurate wind speed series forecast is very pivotal to security of grid dispatching and the application of wind power. Nevertheless, on account of their nonlinear and non-stationary nature, their short-term forecast is extremely challenging. Therefore, this dissertation raises one short-term wind speed forecast pattern on the foundation of attention with an improved gated recurrent neural network (AtGRU) and a tactic of error correction. That model uses the AtGRU model as the preliminary predictor and the GRU model as the error corrector. At the beginning, SSA (singular spectrum analysis) is employed in previous wind speed series for lessening the noise. Subsequently, historical wind speed series is going to be used for the predictor training. During this process, the prediction can have certain errors. The sequence of these errors processed by variational modal decomposition (VMD) is used to train the corrector of error. The eventual forecast consequence is just the sum of predictor forecast and error corrector. The proposed SSA-AtGRU-VMD-GRU model outperforms the compared models in three case studies on Woodburn, St. Thomas, and Santa Cruz. It is indicated that the model evidently enhances the correction of the wind speed forecast.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11422v2,,N,N,N,Y
Distributed Fractional Bayesian Learning for Adaptive Optimization,17/04/2024,"Yaqun Yang, Jinlong Lei, Guanghui Wen, Yiguang Hong","This paper considers a distributed adaptive optimization problem, where all agents only have access to their local cost functions with a common unknown parameter, whereas they mean to collaboratively estimate the true parameter and find the optimal solution over a connected network. A general mathematical framework for such a problem has not been studied yet. We aim to provide valuable insights for addressing parameter uncertainty in distributed optimization problems and simultaneously find the optimal solution. Thus, we propose a novel Prediction while Optimization scheme, which utilizes distributed fractional Bayesian learning through weighted averaging on the log-beliefs to update the beliefs of unknown parameters, and distributed gradient descent for renewing the estimation of the optimal solution. Then under suitable assumptions, we prove that all agents' beliefs and decision variables converge almost surely to the true parameter and the optimal solution under the true parameter, respectively. We further establish a sublinear convergence rate for the belief sequence. Finally, numerical experiments are implemented to corroborate the theoretical analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11354v1,,N,N,N,N
What's under the hood: Investigating Automatic Metrics on Meeting Summarization,17/04/2024,"Frederic Kirstein, Jan Philip Wahle, Terry Ruas, Bela Gipp","Meeting summarization has become a critical task considering the increase in online interactions. While new techniques are introduced regularly, their evaluation uses metrics not designed to capture meeting-specific errors, undermining effective evaluation. This paper investigates what the frequently used automatic metrics capture and which errors they mask by correlating automatic metric scores with human evaluations across a broad error taxonomy. We commence with a comprehensive literature review on English meeting summarization to define key challenges like speaker dynamics and contextual turn-taking and error types such as missing information and linguistic inaccuracy, concepts previously loosely defined in the field. We examine the relationship between characteristic challenges and errors by using annotated transcripts and summaries from Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence and autoregressive models from the general summary QMSum dataset. Through experimental validation, we find that different model architectures respond variably to challenges in meeting transcripts, resulting in different pronounced links between challenges and errors. Current default-used metrics struggle to capture observable errors, showing weak to mid-correlations, while a third of the correlations show trends of error masking. Only a subset reacts accurately to specific errors, while most correlations show either unresponsiveness or failure to reflect the error's impact on summary quality.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11124v1,,N,N,N,N
Variational quantization for state space models,17/04/2024,"Etienne David, Jean Bellot, Sylvain Le Corff","Forecasting tasks using large datasets gathering thousands of heterogeneous time series is a crucial statistical problem in numerous sectors. The main challenge is to model a rich variety of time series, leverage any available external signals and provide sharp predictions with statistical guarantees. In this work, we propose a new forecasting model that combines discrete state space hidden Markov models with recent neural network architectures and training procedures inspired by vector quantized variational autoencoders. We introduce a variational discrete posterior distribution of the latent states given the observations and a two-stage training procedure to alternatively train the parameters of the latent states and of the emission distributions. By learning a collection of emission laws and temporarily activating them depending on the hidden process dynamics, the proposed method allows to explore large datasets and leverage available external signals.

Reuse out-of-year data to enhance land cover mapping via feature disentanglement and contrastive learning,17/04/2024,"Cassio F. Dantas, Raffaele Gaetano, Claudia Paris, Dino Ienco","Timely up-to-date land use/land cover (LULC) maps play a pivotal role in supporting agricultural territory management, environmental monitoring and facilitating well-informed and sustainable decision-making. Typically, when creating a land cover (LC) map, precise ground truth data is collected through time-consuming and expensive field campaigns. This data is then utilized in conjunction with satellite image time series (SITS) through advanced machine learning algorithms to get the final map. Unfortunately, each time this process is repeated (e.g., annually over a region to estimate agricultural production or potential biodiversity loss), new ground truth data must be collected, leading to the complete disregard of previously gathered reference data despite the substantial financial and time investment they have required. How to make value of historical data, from the same or similar study sites, to enhance the current LULC mapping process constitutes a significant challenge that could enable the financial and human-resource efforts invested in previous data campaigns to be valued again. Aiming to tackle this important challenge, we here propose a deep learning framework based on recent advances in domain adaptation and generalization to combine remote sensing and reference data coming from two different domains (e.g. historical data and fresh ones) to ameliorate the current LC mapping process. Our approach, namely REFeD (data Reuse with Effective Feature Disentanglement for land cover mapping), leverages a disentanglement strategy, based on contrastive learning, where invariant and specific per-domain features are derived to recover the intrinsic information related to the downstream LC mapping task and alleviate possible distribution shifts between domains. Additionally, REFeD is equipped with an effective supervision scheme where feature disentanglement is further enforced via multiple levels of supervision at different granularities. The experimental assessment over two study areas covering extremely diverse and contrasted landscapes, namely Koumbia (located in the West-Africa region, in Burkina Faso) and Centre Val de Loire (located in centre Europe, France), underlines the quality of our framework and the obtained findings demonstrate that out-of-year information coming from the same (or similar) study site, at different periods of time, can constitute a valuable additional source of information to enhance the LC mapping process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11114v1,,N,N,N,Y
Inductive-Deductive Strategy Reuse for Multi-Turn Instructional Dialogues,17/04/2024,"Jiao Ou, Jiayu Wu, Che Liu, Fuzheng Zhang, Di Zhang, Kun Gai","Aligning large language models (LLMs) with human expectations requires high-quality instructional dialogues, which can be achieved by raising diverse, in-depth, and insightful instructions that deepen interactions. Existing methods target instructions from real instruction dialogues as a learning goal and fine-tune a user simulator for posing instructions. However, the user simulator struggles to implicitly model complex dialogue flows and pose high-quality instructions. In this paper, we take inspiration from the cognitive abilities inherent in human learning and propose the explicit modeling of complex dialogue flows through instructional strategy reuse. Specifically, we first induce high-level strategies from various real instruction dialogues. These strategies are applied to new dialogue scenarios deductively, where the instructional strategies facilitate high-quality instructions. Experimental results show that our method can generate diverse, in-depth, and insightful instructions for a given dialogue history. The constructed multi-turn instructional dialogues can outperform competitive baselines on the downstream chat model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11095v1,,N,N,N,N
Empowering Large Language Models on Robotic Manipulation with Affordance Prompting,17/04/2024,"Guangran Cheng, Chuheng Zhang, Wenzhe Cai, Li Zhao, Changyin Sun, Jiang Bian","While large language models (LLMs) are successful in completing various language processing tasks, they easily fail to interact with the physical world by generating control sequences properly. We find that the main reason is that LLMs are not grounded in the physical world. Existing LLM-based approaches circumvent this problem by relying on additional pre-defined skills or pre-trained sub-policies, making it hard to adapt to new tasks. In contrast, we aim to address this problem and explore the possibility to prompt pre-trained LLMs to accomplish a series of robotic manipulation tasks in a training-free paradigm. Accordingly, we propose a framework called LLM+A(ffordance) where the LLM serves as both the sub-task planner (that generates high-level plans) and the motion controller (that generates low-level control sequences). To ground these plans and control sequences on the physical world, we develop the affordance prompting technique that stimulates the LLM to 1) predict the consequences of generated plans and 2) generate affordance values for relevant objects. Empirically, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLM+A in various language-conditioned robotic manipulation tasks, which show that our approach substantially improves performance by enhancing the feasibility of generated plans and control and can easily generalize to different environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11027v1,,N,N,N,N
Online Algorithms with Limited Data Retention,17/04/2024,"Nicole Immorlica, Brendan Lucier, Markus Mobius, James Siderius","We introduce a model of online algorithms subject to strict constraints on data retention. An online learning algorithm encounters a stream of data points, one per round, generated by some stationary process. Crucially, each data point can request that it be removed from memory $m$ rounds after it arrives. To model the impact of removal, we do not allow the algorithm to store any information or calculations between rounds other than a subset of the data points (subject to the retention constraints). At the conclusion of the stream, the algorithm answers a statistical query about the full dataset. We ask: what level of performance can be guaranteed as a function of $m$? We illustrate this framework for multidimensional mean estimation and linear regression problems. We show it is possible to obtain an exponential improvement over a baseline algorithm that retains all data as long as possible. Specifically, we show that $m = \textsc{Poly}(d, \log(1/\epsilon))$ retention suffices to achieve mean squared error $\epsilon$ after observing $O(1/\epsilon)$ $d$-dimensional data points. This matches the error bound of the optimal, yet infeasible, algorithm that retains all data forever. We also show a nearly matching lower bound on the retention required to guarantee error $\epsilon$. One implication of our results is that data retention laws are insufficient to guarantee the right to be forgotten even in a non-adversarial world in which firms merely strive to (approximately) optimize the performance of their algorithms. Our approach makes use of recent developments in the multidimensional random subset sum problem to simulate the progression of stochastic gradient descent under a model of adversarial noise, which may be of independent interest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10997v1,,N,N,N,N
Function Approximation for Reinforcement Learning Controller for Energy from Spread Waves,17/04/2024,"Soumyendu Sarkar, Vineet Gundecha, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Alexander Shmakov, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Avisek Naug, Alexandre Pichard, Mathieu Cocho","The industrial multi-generator Wave Energy Converters (WEC) must handle multiple simultaneous waves coming from different directions called spread waves. These complex devices in challenging circumstances need controllers with multiple objectives of energy capture efficiency, reduction of structural stress to limit maintenance, and proactive protection against high waves. The Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) controller trained with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm can handle these complexities. In this paper, we explore different function approximations for the policy and critic networks in modeling the sequential nature of the system dynamics and find that they are key to better performance. We investigated the performance of a fully connected neural network (FCN), LSTM, and Transformer model variants with varying depths and gated residual connections. Our results show that the transformer model of moderate depth with gated residual connections around the multi-head attention, multi-layer perceptron, and the transformer block (STrXL) proposed in this paper is optimal and boosts energy efficiency by an average of 22.1% for these complex spread waves over the existing spring damper (SD) controller. Furthermore, unlike the default SD controller, the transformer controller almost eliminated the mechanical stress from the rotational yaw motion for angled waves.

Our approach is flexible, accommodating various privacy-preserving techniques and model types, and can be applied in horizontal, hybrid, and vertically partitioned federations.

Tao: Re-Thinking DL-based Microarchitecture Simulation,16/04/2024,"Santosh Pandey, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Hang Liu","Microarchitecture simulators are indispensable tools for microarchitecture designers to validate, estimate, and optimize new hardware that meets specific design requirements. While the quest for a fast, accurate and detailed microarchitecture simulation has been ongoing for decades, existing simulators excel and fall short at different aspects: (i) Although execution-driven simulation is accurate and detailed, it is extremely slow and requires expert-level experience to design. (ii) Trace-driven simulation reuses the execution traces in pursuit of fast simulation but faces accuracy concerns and fails to achieve significant speedup. (iii) Emerging deep learning (DL)-based simulations are remarkably fast and have acceptable accuracy but fail to provide adequate low-level microarchitectural performance metrics crucial for microarchitectural bottleneck analysis. Additionally, they introduce substantial overheads from trace regeneration and model re-training when simulating a new microarchitecture. Re-thinking the advantages and limitations of the aforementioned simulation paradigms, this paper introduces TAO that redesigns the DL-based simulation with three primary contributions: First, we propose a new training dataset design such that the subsequent simulation only needs functional trace as inputs, which can be rapidly generated and reused across microarchitectures. Second, we redesign the input features and the DL model using self-attention to support predicting various performance metrics. Third, we propose techniques to train a microarchitecture agnostic embedding layer that enables fast transfer learning between different microarchitectural configurations and reduces the re-training overhead of conventional DL-based simulators. Our extensive evaluation shows TAO can reduce the overall training and simulation time by 18.06x over the state-of-the-art DL-based endeavors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10921v2,,N,N,N,N
A variational neural Bayes framework for inference on intractable posterior distributions,16/04/2024,"Elliot Maceda, Emily C. Hector, Amanda Lenzi, Brian J. Reich","Classic Bayesian methods with complex models are frequently infeasible due to an intractable likelihood. Simulation-based inference methods, such as Approximate Bayesian Computing (ABC), calculate posteriors without accessing a likelihood function by leveraging the fact that data can be quickly simulated from the model, but converge slowly and/or poorly in high-dimensional settings. In this paper, we propose a framework for Bayesian posterior estimation by mapping data to posteriors of parameters using a neural network trained on data simulated from the complex model. Posterior distributions of model parameters are efficiently obtained by feeding observed data into the trained neural network. We show theoretically that our posteriors converge to the true posteriors in Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our approach yields computationally efficient and theoretically justified uncertainty quantification, which is lacking in existing simulation-based neural network approaches. Comprehensive simulation studies highlight our method's robustness and accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10899v1,,N,N,N,N
Tree Bandits for Generative Bayes,16/04/2024,"Sean O'Hagan, Jungeum Kim, Veronika Rockova","In generative models with obscured likelihood, Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) is often the tool of last resort for inference. However, ABC demands many prior parameter trials to keep only a small fraction that passes an acceptance test. To accelerate ABC rejection sampling, this paper develops a self-aware framework that learns from past trials and errors. We apply recursive partitioning classifiers on the ABC lookup table to sequentially refine high-likelihood regions into boxes. Each box is regarded as an arm in a binary bandit problem treating ABC acceptance as a reward. Each arm has a proclivity for being chosen for the next ABC evaluation, depending on the prior distribution and past rejections. The method places more splits in those areas where the likelihood resides, shying away from low-probability regions destined for ABC rejections. We provide two versions: (1) ABC-Tree for posterior sampling, and (2) ABC-MAP for maximum a posteriori estimation. We demonstrate accurate ABC approximability at much lower simulation cost. We justify the use of our tree-based bandit algorithms with nearly optimal regret bounds. Finally, we successfully apply our approach to the problem of masked image classification using deep generative models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10436v1,,N,N,N,Y
Offline Trajectory Generalization for Offline Reinforcement Learning,16/04/2024,"Ziqi Zhao, Zhaochun Ren, Liu Yang, Fajie Yuan, Pengjie Ren, Zhumin Chen, jun Ma, Xin Xin","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies from static datasets of previously collected trajectories. Existing methods for offline RL either constrain the learned policy to the support of offline data or utilize model-based virtual environments to generate simulated rollouts. However, these methods suffer from (i) poor generalization to unseen states; and (ii) trivial improvement from low-qualified rollout simulation. In this paper, we propose offline trajectory generalization through world transformers for offline reinforcement learning (OTTO). Specifically, we use casual Transformers, a.k.a. World Transformers, to predict state dynamics and the immediate reward. Then we propose four strategies to use World Transformers to generate high-rewarded trajectory simulation by perturbing the offline data. Finally, we jointly use offline data with simulated data to train an offline RL algorithm. OTTO serves as a plug-in module and can be integrated with existing offline RL methods to enhance them with better generalization capability of transformers and high-rewarded data augmentation.

Learning Wireless Data Knowledge Graph for Green Intelligent Communications: Methodology and Experiments,16/04/2024,"Yongming Huang, Xiaohu You, Hang Zhan, Shiwen He, Ningning Fu, Wei Xu","Intelligent communications have played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks. Native artificial intelligence (AI) within green communication systems must meet stringent real-time requirements. To achieve this, deploying lightweight and resource-efficient AI models is necessary. However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and indicators during operation, only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the network AI models. Therefore, real-time intelligence of communication systems heavily relies on a small but critical set of the data that profoundly influences the performance of network AI models. These challenges underscore the need for innovative architectures and solutions. In this paper, we propose a solution, termed the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which integrates the concept of knowledge graph (KG) into the intelligent operational manipulations of mobile networks, resulting in the establishment of a wireless data KG. Leveraging the wireless data KG, we characterize the massive and complex data collected from wireless communication networks and analyze the relationships among various data fields. The obtained graph of data field relations enables the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets, tailored to specific application requirements. Consequently, this architecture not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks. To implement this architecture, we have developed a specific solution comprising a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) as well as a feature dataset generation algorithm.

Attention-based biasing is a leading approach which allows for full end-to-end cotraining of the recognizer and biasing system and requires no separate inference-time components. Such biasers typically consist of a context encoder; followed by a context filter which narrows down the context to apply, improving per-step inference time; and, finally, context application via cross attention. Though much work has gone into optimizing per-frame performance, the context encoder is at least as important: recognition cannot begin before context encoding ends. Here, we show the lightweight phrase selection pass can be moved before context encoding, resulting in a speedup of up to 16.1 times and enabling biasing to scale to 20K phrases with a maximum pre-decoding delay under 33ms.

Optimal Kernel Tuning Parameter Prediction using Deep Sequence Models,15/04/2024,"Khawir Mahmood, Jehandad Khan, Hammad Afzal","GPU kernels have come to the forefront of computing due to their utility in varied fields, from high-performance computing to machine learning. A typical GPU compute kernel is invoked millions, if not billions of times in a typical application, which makes their performance highly critical. Due to the unknown nature of the optimization surface, an exhaustive search is required to discover the global optimum, which is infeasible due to the possible exponential number of parameter combinations. In this work, we propose a methodology that uses deep sequence-to-sequence models to predict the optimal tuning parameters governing compute kernels. This work considers the prediction of kernel parameters as a sequence to the sequence translation problem, borrowing models from the Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain. Parameters describing the input, output and weight tensors are considered as the input language to the model that emits the corresponding kernel parameters. In essence, the model translates the problem parameter language to kernel parameter language. The core contributions of this work are: a) Proposing that a sequence to sequence model can accurately learn the performance dynamics of a GPU compute kernel b) A novel network architecture which predicts the kernel tuning parameters for GPU kernels, c) A constrained beam search which incorporates the physical limits of the GPU hardware as well as other expert knowledge reducing the search space. The proposed algorithm can achieve more than 90% accuracy on various convolutional kernels in MIOpen, the AMD machine learning primitives library. As a result, the proposed technique can reduce the development time and compute resources required to tune unseen input configurations, resulting in shorter development cycles, reduced development costs, and better user experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10162v1,,N,N,N,Y
Language Model Cascades: Token-level uncertainty and beyond,15/04/2024,"Neha Gupta, Harikrishna Narasimhan, Wittawat Jitkrittum, Ankit Singh Rawat, Aditya Krishna Menon, Sanjiv Kumar","Recent advances in language models (LMs) have led to significant improvements in quality on complex NLP tasks, but at the expense of increased inference costs. Cascading offers a simple strategy to achieve more favorable cost-quality tradeoffs: here, a small model is invoked for most ""easy"" instances, while a few ""hard"" instances are deferred to the large model. While the principles underpinning cascading are well-studied for classification tasks - with deferral based on predicted class uncertainty favored theoretically and practically - a similar understanding is lacking for generative LM tasks. In this work, we initiate a systematic study of deferral rules for LM cascades. We begin by examining the natural extension of predicted class uncertainty to generative LM tasks, namely, the predicted sequence uncertainty. We show that this measure suffers from the length bias problem, either over- or under-emphasizing outputs based on their lengths. This is because LMs produce a sequence of uncertainty values, one for each output token; and moreover, the number of output tokens is variable across examples. To mitigate this issue, we propose to exploit the richer token-level uncertainty information implicit in generative LMs. We argue that naive predicted sequence uncertainty corresponds to a simple aggregation of these uncertainties. By contrast, we show that incorporating token-level uncertainty through learned post-hoc deferral rules can significantly outperform such simple aggregation strategies, via experiments on a range of natural language benchmarks with FLAN-T5 models. We further show that incorporating embeddings from the smaller model and intermediate layers of the larger model can give an additional boost in the overall cost-quality tradeoff.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10136v1,,N,N,N,Y
Using Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) to merge precipitation data over mountainous area in Sierra Nevada,15/04/2024,"Yihan Wang, Lujun Zhang","Obtaining reliable precipitation estimation with high resolutions in time and space is of great importance to hydrological studies. However, accurately estimating precipitation is a challenging task over high mountainous complex terrain. The three widely used precipitation measurement approaches, namely rainfall gauge, precipitation radars, and satellite-based precipitation sensors, have their own pros and cons in producing reliable precipitation products over complex areas. One way to decrease the detection error probability and improve data reliability is precipitation data merging. With the rapid advancements in computational capabilities and the escalating volume and diversity of earth observational data, Deep Learning (DL) models have gained considerable attention in geoscience. In this study, a deep learning technique, namely Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), was employed to merge a radar-based and a satellite-based Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product Integrated Multi-Satellite Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) precipitation product at hourly scale.

The findings indicated that the LSTM-based merged precipitation notably underestimated gauge observations and, at times, failed to provide meaningful estimates, showing predominantly near-zero values. Relying solely on individual Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPEs) without additional meteorological input proved insufficient for generating reliable merged QPE. However, the merged results effectively captured the temporal trends of the observations, outperforming MRMS in this aspect. This suggested that incorporating bias correction techniques could potentially enhance the accuracy of the merged product.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10135v2,,N,N,N,N
AIGeN: An Adversarial Approach for Instruction Generation in VLN,15/04/2024,"Niyati Rawal, Roberto Bigazzi, Lorenzo Baraldi, Rita Cucchiara","In the last few years, the research interest in Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) has grown significantly. VLN is a challenging task that involves an agent following human instructions and navigating in a previously unknown environment to reach a specified goal. Recent work in literature focuses on different ways to augment the available datasets of instructions for improving navigation performance by exploiting synthetic training data. In this work, we propose AIGeN, a novel architecture inspired by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that produces meaningful and well-formed synthetic instructions to improve navigation agents' performance. The model is composed of a Transformer decoder (GPT-2) and a Transformer encoder (BERT). During the training phase, the decoder generates sentences for a sequence of images describing the agent's path to a particular point while the encoder discriminates between real and fake instructions. Experimentally, we evaluate the quality of the generated instructions and perform extensive ablation studies. Additionally, we generate synthetic instructions for 217K trajectories using AIGeN on Habitat-Matterport 3D Dataset (HM3D) and show an improvement in the performance of an off-the-shelf VLN method. The validation analysis of our proposal is conducted on REVERIE and R2R and highlights the promising aspects of our proposal, achieving state-of-the-art performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10054v1,,N,N,N,N
Variational quantum simulation: a case study for understanding warm starts,15/04/2024,"Ricard Puig-i-Valls, Marc Drudis, Supanut Thanasilp, Zo√´ Holmes","The barren plateau phenomenon, characterized by loss gradients that vanish exponentially with system size, poses a challenge to scaling variational quantum algorithms. Here we explore the potential of warm starts, whereby one initializes closer to a solution in the hope of enjoying larger loss variances. Focusing on an iterative variational method for learning shorter-depth circuits for quantum real and imaginary time evolution we conduct a case study to elucidate the potential and limitations of warm starts. We start by proving that the iterative variational algorithm will exhibit substantial (at worst vanishing polynomially in system size) gradients in a small region around the initializations at each time-step. Convexity guarantees for these regions are then established, suggesting trainability for polynomial size time-steps. However, our study highlights scenarios where a good minimum shifts outside the region with trainability guarantees. Our analysis leaves open the question whether such minima jumps necessitate optimization across barren plateau landscapes or whether there exist gradient flows, i.e., fertile valleys away from the plateau with substantial gradients, that allow for training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10044v2,,N,N,N,N
Federated Learning on Riemannian Manifolds with Differential Privacy,15/04/2024,"Zhenwei Huang, Wen Huang, Pratik Jawanpuria, Bamdev Mishra","In recent years, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a prominent paradigm in distributed machine learning. Despite the partial safeguarding of agents' information within FL systems, a malicious adversary can potentially infer sensitive information through various means. In this paper, we propose a generic private FL framework defined on Riemannian manifolds (PriRFed) based on the differential privacy (DP) technique. We analyze the privacy guarantee while establishing the convergence properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first federated learning framework on Riemannian manifold with a privacy guarantee and convergence results. Numerical simulations are performed on synthetic and real-world datasets to showcase the efficacy of the proposed PriRFed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.10029v1,,N,N,N,N
Sampling for Model Predictive Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving using Normalizing Flows,15/04/2024,"Georg Rabenstein, Lars Ullrich, Knut Graichen","Alongside optimization-based planners, sampling-based approaches are often used in trajectory planning for autonomous driving due to their simplicity. Model predictive path integral control is a framework that builds upon optimization principles while incorporating stochastic sampling of input trajectories. This paper investigates several sampling approaches for trajectory generation. In this context, normalizing flows originating from the field of variational inference are considered for the generation of sampling distributions, as they model transformations of simple to more complex distributions. Accordingly, learning-based normalizing flow models are trained for a more efficient exploration of the input domain for the task at hand. The developed algorithm and the proposed sampling distributions are evaluated in two simulation scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09657v1,,N,N,N,N
œÉ-GPTs: A New Approach to Autoregressive Models,15/04/2024,"Arnaud Pannatier, Evann Courdier, Fran√ßois Fleuret","Autoregressive models, such as the GPT family, use a fixed order, usually left-to-right, to generate sequences. However, this is not a necessity. In this paper, we challenge this assumption and show that by simply adding a positional encoding for the output, this order can be modulated on-the-fly per-sample which offers key advantageous properties. It allows for the sampling of and conditioning on arbitrary subsets of tokens, and it also allows sampling in one shot multiple tokens dynamically according to a rejection strategy, leading to a sub-linear number of model evaluations. We evaluate our method across various domains, including language modeling, path-solving, and aircraft vertical rate prediction, decreasing the number of steps required for generation by an order of magnitude.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09562v1,,N,N,N,Y
Characterization and Mitigation of Insufficiencies in Automated Driving Systems,15/04/2024,"Yuting Fu, Jochen Seemann, Caspar Hanselaar, Tim Beurskens, Andrei Terechko, Emilia Silvas, Maurice Heemels","Automated Driving (AD) systems have the potential to increase safety, comfort and energy efficiency. Recently, major automotive companies have started testing and validating AD systems (ADS) on public roads. Nevertheless, the commercial deployment and wide adoption of ADS have been moderate, partially due to system functional insufficiencies (FI) that undermine passenger safety and lead to hazardous situations on the road. FIs are defined in ISO 21448 Safety Of The Intended Functionality (SOTIF). FIs are insufficiencies in sensors, actuators and algorithm implementations, including neural networks and probabilistic calculations. Examples of FIs in ADS include inaccurate ego-vehicle localization on the road, incorrect prediction of a cyclist maneuver, unreliable detection of a pedestrian, etc. The main goal of our study is to formulate a generic architectural design pattern, which is compatible with existing methods and ADS, to improve FI mitigation and enable faster commercial deployment of ADS. First, we studied the 2021 autonomous vehicles disengagement reports published by the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV). The data clearly show that disengagements are five times more often caused by FIs rather than by system faults. We then made a comprehensive list of insufficiencies and their characteristics by analyzing over 10 hours of publicly available road test videos. In particular, we identified insufficiency types in four major categories: world model, motion plan, traffic rule, and operational design domain. The insufficiency characterization helps making the SOTIF analyses of triggering conditions more systematic and comprehensive. Based on our FI characterization, simulation experiments and literature survey, we define a novel generic architectural design pattern Daruma to dynamically select the channel that is least likely to have a FI at the moment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09557v1,,N,N,N,N
TMPQ-DM: Joint Timestep Reduction and Quantization Precision Selection for Efficient Diffusion Models,15/04/2024,"Haojun Sun, Chen Tang, Zhi Wang, Yuan Meng, Jingyan jiang, Xinzhu Ma, Wenwu Zhu","Diffusion models have emerged as preeminent contenders in the realm of generative models. Distinguished by their distinctive sequential generative processes, characterized by hundreds or even thousands of timesteps, diffusion models progressively reconstruct images from pure Gaussian noise, with each timestep necessitating full inference of the entire model. However, the substantial computational demands inherent to these models present challenges for deployment, quantization is thus widely used to lower the bit-width for reducing the storage and computing overheads. Current quantization methodologies primarily focus on model-side optimization, disregarding the temporal dimension, such as the length of the timestep sequence, thereby allowing redundant timesteps to continue consuming computational resources, leaving substantial scope for accelerating the generative process. In this paper, we introduce TMPQ-DM, which jointly optimizes timestep reduction and quantization to achieve a superior performance-efficiency trade-off, addressing both temporal and model optimization aspects. For timestep reduction, we devise a non-uniform grouping scheme tailored to the non-uniform nature of the denoising process, thereby mitigating the explosive combinations of timesteps. In terms of quantization, we adopt a fine-grained layer-wise approach to allocate varying bit-widths to different layers based on their respective contributions to the final generative performance, thus rectifying performance degradation observed in prior studies. To expedite the evaluation of fine-grained quantization, we further devise a super-network to serve as a precision solver by leveraging shared quantization results. These two design components are seamlessly integrated within our framework, enabling rapid joint exploration of the exponentially large decision space via a gradient-free evolutionary search algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09532v1,,Y,N,N,Y
Prepacking: A Simple Method for Fast Prefilling and Increased Throughput in Large Language Models,15/04/2024,"Siyan Zhao, Daniel Israel, Guy Van den Broeck, Aditya Grover","During inference for transformer-based large language models (LLM), prefilling is the computation of the key-value (KV) cache for input tokens in the prompt prior to autoregressive generation. For longer input prompt lengths, prefilling will incur a significant overhead on decoding time. In this work, we highlight the following pitfall of prefilling: for batches containing high-varying prompt lengths, significant computation is wasted by the standard practice of padding sequences to the maximum length. As LLMs increasingly support longer context lengths, potentially up to 10 million tokens, variations in prompt lengths within a batch become more pronounced. To address this, we propose Prepacking, a simple yet effective method to optimize prefilling computation. To avoid redundant computation on pad tokens, prepacking combines prompts of varying lengths into a sequence and packs multiple sequences into a compact batch using a bin-packing algorithm. It then modifies the attention mask and positional encoding to compute multiple prefilled KV-caches for multiple prompts within a single sequence. On standard curated dataset containing prompts with varying lengths, we obtain a significant speed and memory efficiency improvements as compared to the default padding-based prefilling computation within Huggingface across a range of base model configurations and inference serving scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09529v1,,N,N,N,N
Inferring Behavior-Specific Context Improves Zero-Shot Generalization in Reinforcement Learning,15/04/2024,"Tidiane Camaret Ndir, Andr√© Biedenkapp, Noor Awad","In this work, we address the challenge of zero-shot generalization (ZSG) in Reinforcement Learning (RL), where agents must adapt to entirely novel environments without additional training. We argue that understanding and utilizing contextual cues, such as the gravity level of the environment, is critical for robust generalization, and we propose to integrate the learning of context representations directly with policy learning. Our algorithm demonstrates improved generalization on various simulated domains, outperforming prior context-learning techniques in zero-shot settings. By jointly learning policy and context, our method acquires behavior-specific context representations, enabling adaptation to unseen environments and marks progress towards reinforcement learning systems that generalize across diverse real-world tasks.

Existing work suffers from certain limitations (a) (Liang et al., 2023) and their multi-modal extensions, rely heavily on prior knowledge and are not grounded in the demonstrations (b) (Liu et al., 2023) lack the ability to generalize due to their purely neural approach. A key challenge is to achieve a fine balance between symbolic representations which have the capability to generalize, and neural representations that are physically grounded. In response, we propose a neuro-symbolic approach by expressing inductive concepts as symbolic compositions over grounded neural concepts. Our key insight is to decompose the concept learning problem into the following steps 1) Sketch: Getting a programmatic representation for the given instruction 2) Plan: Perform Model-Based RL over the sequence of grounded neural action concepts to learn a grounded plan 3) Generalize: Abstract out a generic (lifted) Python program to facilitate generalizability. Continual learning is achieved by interspersing learning of grounded neural concepts with higher level symbolic constructs.

PINNACLE: PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection,11/04/2024,"Gregory Kang Ruey Lau, Apivich Hemachandra, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs), which incorporate PDEs as soft constraints, train with a composite loss function that contains multiple training point types: different types of collocation points chosen during training to enforce each PDE and initial/boundary conditions, and experimental points which are usually costly to obtain via experiments or simulations. Training PINNs using this loss function is challenging as it typically requires selecting large numbers of points of different types, each with different training dynamics. Unlike past works that focused on the selection of either collocation or experimental points, this work introduces PINN Adaptive ColLocation and Experimental points selection (PINNACLE), the first algorithm that jointly optimizes the selection of all training point types, while automatically adjusting the proportion of collocation point types as training progresses. PINNACLE uses information on the interaction among training point types, which had not been considered before, based on an analysis of PINN training dynamics via the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK). We theoretically show that the criterion used by PINNACLE is related to the PINN generalization error, and empirically demonstrate that PINNACLE is able to outperform existing point selection methods for forward, inverse, and transfer learning problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07662v1,,N,N,N,Y
Diffusion posterior sampling for simulation-based inference in tall data settings,11/04/2024,"Julia Linhart, Gabriel Victorino Cardoso, Alexandre Gramfort, Sylvain Le Corff, Pedro L. C. Rodrigues","Determining which parameters of a non-linear model could best describe a set of experimental data is a fundamental problem in science and it has gained much traction lately with the rise of complex large-scale simulators (a.k.a. black-box simulators). The likelihood of such models is typically intractable, which is why classical MCMC methods can not be used. Simulation-based inference (SBI) stands out in this context by only requiring a dataset of simulations to train deep generative models capable of approximating the posterior distribution that relates input parameters to a given observation. In this work, we consider a tall data extension in which multiple observations are available and one wishes to leverage their shared information to better infer the parameters of the model. The method we propose is built upon recent developments from the flourishing score-based diffusion literature and allows us to estimate the tall data posterior distribution simply using information from the score network trained on individual observations. We compare our method to recently proposed competing approaches on various numerical experiments and demonstrate its superiority in terms of numerical stability and computational cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07593v1,,N,N,N,N

Then, by carefully integrating message passing and VBI with a decentralized turbo framework, we propose the D-Turbo-VBI algorithm which can (i) reduce both upstream and downstream communication overhead during federated training, and (ii) reduce the computational complexity during local inference. Additionally, we establish the convergence property for thr proposed D-Turbo-VBI algorithm.

Generative Probabilistic Planning for Optimizing Supply Chain Networks,11/04/2024,"Hyung-il Ahn, Santiago Olivar, Hershel Mehta, Young Chol Song","Supply chain networks in enterprises are typically composed of complex topological graphs involving various types of nodes and edges, accommodating numerous products with considerable demand and supply variability. However, as supply chain networks expand in size and complexity, traditional supply chain planning methods (e.g., those found in heuristic rule-based and operations research-based systems) tend to become locally optimal or lack computational scalability, resulting in substantial imbalances between supply and demand across nodes in the network. This paper introduces a novel Generative AI technique, which we call Generative Probabilistic Planning (GPP). GPP generates dynamic supply action plans that are globally optimized across all network nodes over the time horizon for changing objectives like maximizing profits or service levels, factoring in time-varying probabilistic demand, lead time, and production conditions. GPP leverages attention-based graph neural networks (GNN), offline deep reinforcement learning (Offline RL), and policy simulations to train generative policy models and create optimal plans through probabilistic simulations, effectively accounting for various uncertainties. Our experiments using historical data from a global consumer goods company with complex supply chain networks demonstrate that GPP accomplishes objective-adaptable, probabilistically resilient, and dynamic planning for supply chain networks, leading to significant improvements in performance and profitability for enterprises. Our work plays a pivotal role in shaping the trajectory of AI adoption within the supply chain domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07511v1,,N,N,N,Y
VeTraSS: Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search Through Graph Modeling and Representation Learning,11/04/2024,"Ming Cheng, Bowen Zhang, Ziyu Wang, Ziyi Zhou, Weiqi Feng, Yi Lyu, Xingjian Diao","Trajectory similarity search plays an essential role in autonomous driving, as it enables vehicles to analyze the information and characteristics of different trajectories to make informed decisions and navigate safely in dynamic environments. Existing work on the trajectory similarity search task primarily utilizes sequence-processing algorithms or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), which suffer from the inevitable issues of complicated architecture and heavy training costs. Considering the intricate connections between trajectories, using Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for data modeling is feasible. However, most methods directly use existing mathematical graph structures as the input instead of constructing specific graphs from certain vehicle trajectory data. This ignores such data's unique and dynamic characteristics. To bridge such a research gap, we propose VeTraSS -- an end-to-end pipeline for Vehicle Trajectory Similarity Search. Specifically, VeTraSS models the original trajectory data into multi-scale graphs, and generates comprehensive embeddings through a novel multi-layer attention-based GNN. The learned embeddings can be used for searching similar vehicle trajectories. Extensive experiments on the Porto and Geolife datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of VeTraSS, where our model outperforms existing work and reaches the state-of-the-art. This demonstrates the potential of VeTraSS for trajectory analysis and safe navigation in self-driving vehicles in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08021v1,,N,N,N,Y
Graph Attention Network for Lane-Wise and Topology-Invariant Intersection Traffic Simulation,11/04/2024,"Nooshin Yousefzadeh, Rahul Sengupta, Yashaswi Karnati, Anand Rangarajan, Sanjay Ranka","Traffic congestion has significant economic, environmental, and social ramifications. Intersection traffic flow dynamics are influenced by numerous factors. While microscopic traffic simulators are valuable tools, they are computationally intensive and challenging to calibrate. Moreover, existing machine-learning approaches struggle to provide lane-specific waveforms or adapt to intersection topology and traffic patterns. In this study, we propose two efficient and accurate ""Digital Twin"" models for intersections, leveraging Graph Attention Neural Networks (GAT). These attentional graph auto-encoder digital twins capture temporal, spatial, and contextual aspects of traffic within intersections, incorporating various influential factors such as high-resolution loop detector waveforms, signal state records, driving behaviors, and turning-movement counts. Trained on diverse counterfactual scenarios across multiple intersections, our models generalize well, enabling the estimation of detailed traffic waveforms for any intersection approach and exit lanes. Multi-scale error metrics demonstrate that our models perform comparably to microsimulations. The primary application of our study lies in traffic signal optimization, a pivotal area in transportation systems research. These lightweight digital twins can seamlessly integrate into corridor and network signal timing optimization frameworks. Furthermore, our study's applications extend to lane reconfiguration, driving behavior analysis, and facilitating informed decisions regarding intersection safety and efficiency enhancements.

Deep Generative Sampling in the Dual Divergence Space: A Data-efficient & Interpretative Approach for Generative AI,10/04/2024,"Sahil Garg, Anderson Schneider, Anant Raj, Kashif Rasul, Yuriy Nevmyvaka, Sneihil Gopal, Amit Dhurandhar, Guillermo Cecchi, Irina Rish","Building on the remarkable achievements in generative sampling of natural images, we propose an innovative challenge, potentially overly ambitious, which involves generating samples of entire multivariate time series that resemble images. However, the statistical challenge lies in the small sample size, sometimes consisting of a few hundred subjects. This issue is especially problematic for deep generative models that follow the conventional approach of generating samples from a canonical distribution and then decoding or denoising them to match the true data distribution. In contrast, our method is grounded in information theory and aims to implicitly characterize the distribution of images, particularly the (global and local) dependency structure between pixels. We achieve this by empirically estimating its KL-divergence in the dual form with respect to the respective marginal distribution. This enables us to perform generative sampling directly in the optimized 1-D dual divergence space. Specifically, in the dual space, training samples representing the data distribution are embedded in the form of various clusters between two end points. In theory, any sample embedded between those two end points is in-distribution w.r.t. the data distribution. Our key idea for generating novel samples of images is to interpolate between the clusters via a walk as per gradients of the dual function w.r.t. the data dimensions. In addition to the data efficiency gained from direct sampling, we propose an algorithm that offers a significant reduction in sample complexity for estimating the divergence of the data distribution with respect to the marginal distribution. We provide strong theoretical guarantees along with an extensive empirical evaluation using many real-world datasets from diverse domains, establishing the superiority of our approach w.r.t. state-of-the-art deep learning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07377v1,,N,N,N,Y

Predicting Mergers and Acquisitions: Temporal Dynamic Industry Networks,10/04/2024,Dayu Yang,"M&A activities are pivotal for market consolidation, enabling firms to augment market power through strategic complementarities. Existing research often overlooks the peer effect, the mutual influence of M&A behaviors among firms, and fails to capture complex interdependencies within industry networks. Common approaches suffer from reliance on ad-hoc feature engineering, data truncation leading to significant information loss, reduced predictive accuracy, and challenges in real-world application. Additionally, the rarity of M&A events necessitates data rebalancing in conventional models, introducing bias and undermining prediction reliability. We propose an innovative M&A predictive model utilizing the Temporal Dynamic Industry Network (TDIN), leveraging temporal point processes and deep learning to adeptly capture industry-wide M&A dynamics. This model facilitates accurate, detailed deal-level predictions without arbitrary data manipulation or rebalancing, demonstrated through superior evaluation results from M&A cases between January 1997 and December 2020.

While retrospective evaluation metrics show decreased mortality when these policies are followed, studies with clinicians suggest their recommendations are often spurious. We propose that these shortcomings may be due to lack of diversity in observed actions and outcomes in the training data, and we construct experiments to investigate the feasibility of predicting sepsis disease severity changes due to clinician actions. Preliminary results suggest incorporating action information does not significantly improve model performance, indicating that clinician actions may not be sufficiently variable to yield measurable effects on disease progression.

Hedonic Models Incorporating ESG Factors for Time Series of Average Annual Home Prices,10/04/2024,"Jason R. Bailey, W. Brent Lindquist, Svetlozar T. Rachev","Using data from 2000 through 2022, we analyze the predictive capability of the annual numbers of new home constructions and four available environmental, social, and governance factors on the average annual price of homes sold in eight major U.S. cities. We contrast the predictive capability of a P-spline generalized additive model (GAM) against a strictly linear version of the commonly used generalized linear model (GLM). As the data for the annual price and predictor variables constitute non-stationary time series, to avoid spurious correlations in the analysis we transform each time series appropriately to produce stationary series for use in the GAM and GLM models. While arithmetic returns or first differences are adequate transformations for the predictor variables, for the average price response variable we utilize the series of innovations obtained from AR(q)-ARCH(1) fits. Based on the GAM results, we find that the influence of ESG factors varies markedly by city, reflecting geographic diversity. Notably, the presence of air conditioning emerges as a strong factor. Despite limitations on the length of available time series, this study represents a pivotal step toward integrating ESG considerations into predictive real estate models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07132v1,,N,N,N,N
Rethinking Out-of-Distribution Detection for Reinforcement Learning: Advancing Methods for Evaluation and Detection,10/04/2024,"Linas Nasvytis, Kai Sandbrink, Jakob Foerster, Tim Franzmeyer, Christian Schroeder de Witt","While reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been successfully applied across numerous sequential decision-making problems, their generalization to unforeseen testing environments remains a significant concern. In this paper, we study the problem of out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in RL, which focuses on identifying situations at test time that RL agents have not encountered in their training environments. We first propose a clarification of terminology for OOD detection in RL, which aligns it with the literature from other machine learning domains. We then present new benchmark scenarios for OOD detection, which introduce anomalies with temporal autocorrelation into different components of the agent-environment loop. We argue that such scenarios have been understudied in the current literature, despite their relevance to real-world situations. Confirming our theoretical predictions, our experimental results suggest that state-of-the-art OOD detectors are not able to identify such anomalies. To address this problem, we propose a novel method for OOD detection, which we call DEXTER (Detection via Extraction of Time Series Representations). By treating environment observations as time series data, DEXTER extracts salient time series features, and then leverages an ensemble of isolation forest algorithms to detect anomalies. We find that DEXTER can reliably identify anomalies across benchmark scenarios, exhibiting superior performance compared to both state-of-the-art OOD detectors and high-dimensional changepoint detectors adopted from statistics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.07099v1,,N,N,N,N

Beyond such preprocessing, machine learners would hope to deal with such data as with any other time series data. For EEG classification many models have been developed with layer types and architectures we typically do not see in time series classification. Furthermore, typically separate models for each individual subject are learned, not one model for all of them. In this paper, we systematically study the differences between EEG classification models and generic time series classification models. We describe three different model setups to deal with EEG data from different subjects, subject-specific models (most EEG literature), subject-agnostic models and subject-conditional models. In experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that off-the-shelf time series classification models trained per subject perform close to EEG classification models, but that do not quite reach the performance of domain-specific modeling. Additionally, we combine time-series models with subject embeddings to train one joint subject-conditional classifier on all subjects.

Neural temporal point process (NTPP) has achieved great success in modeling event sequences that occur in continuous time space. However, due to the black-box nature of neural networks, existing NTPP models fall short in explaining the dependencies between different event types. In this paper, inspired by word2vec and Hawkes process, we propose an interpretable framework inf2vec for event sequence modelling, where the event influences are directly parameterized and can be learned end-to-end. In the experiment, we demonstrate the superiority of our model on event prediction as well as type-type influences learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08007v1,,Y,N,N,Y
Neural Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling with Attention by Leveraging Deep Learning Architectures for Enhanced Contextual Understanding in Abstractive Text Summarization,08/04/2024,"Bhavith Chandra Challagundla, Chakradhar Peddavenkatagari","Automatic text summarization (TS) plays a pivotal role in condensing large volumes of information into concise, coherent summaries, facilitating efficient information retrieval and comprehension. This paper presents a novel framework for abstractive TS of single documents, which integrates three dominant aspects: structural, semantic, and neural-based approaches. The proposed framework merges machine learning and knowledge-based techniques to achieve a unified methodology. The framework consists of three main phases: pre-processing, machine learning, and post-processing. In the pre-processing phase, a knowledge-based Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) technique is employed to generalize ambiguous words, enhancing content generalization. Semantic content generalization is then performed to address out-of-vocabulary (OOV) or rare words, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the input document. Subsequently, the generalized text is transformed into a continuous vector space using neural language processing techniques. A deep sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) model with an attention mechanism is employed to predict a generalized summary based on the vector representation. In the post-processing phase, heuristic algorithms and text similarity metrics are utilized to refine the generated summary further. Concepts from the generalized summary are matched with specific entities, enhancing coherence and readability. Experimental evaluations conducted on prominent datasets, including Gigaword, Duc 2004, and CNN/DailyMail, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Results indicate significant improvements in handling rare and OOV words, outperforming existing state-of-the-art deep learning techniques. The proposed framework presents a comprehensive and unified approach towards abstractive TS, combining the strengths of structure, semantics, and neural-based methodologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08685v1,,N,N,N,N
Back to the Future: GNN-based NO$_2$ Forecasting via Future Covariates,08/04/2024,"Antonio Giganti, Sara Mandelli, Paolo Bestagini, Umberto Giuriato, Alessandro D'Ausilio, Marco Marcon, Stefano Tubaro","Due to the latest environmental concerns in keeping at bay contaminants emissions in urban areas, air pollution forecasting has been rising the forefront of all researchers around the world. When predicting pollutant concentrations, it is common to include the effects of environmental factors that influence these concentrations within an extended period, like traffic, meteorological conditions and geographical information. Most of the existing approaches exploit this information as past covariates, i.e., past exogenous variables that affected the pollutant but were not affected by it. In this paper, we present a novel forecasting methodology to predict NO$_2$ concentration via both past and future covariates. Future covariates are represented by weather forecasts and future calendar events, which are already known at prediction time. In particular, we deal with air quality observations in a city-wide network of ground monitoring stations, modeling the data structure and estimating the predictions with a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN). We propose a conditioning block that embeds past and future covariates into the current observations. After extracting meaningful spatiotemporal representations, these are fused together and projected into the forecasting horizon to generate the final prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that future covariates are included in time series predictions in a structured way. Remarkably, we find that conditioning on future weather information has a greater impact than considering past traffic conditions. We release our code implementation at https://github.com/polimi-ispl/MAGCRN.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05324v1,,N,N,N,Y
StockGPT: A GenAI Model for Stock Prediction and Trading,07/04/2024,Dat Mai,"This paper introduces StockGPT, an autoregressive ``number'' model trained and tested on 70 million daily U.S. stock returns over nearly 100 years. Treating each return series as a sequence of tokens, StockGPT automatically learns the hidden patterns predictive of future returns via its attention mechanism. On a held-out test sample from 2001 to 2023, a daily rebalanced long-short portfolio formed from StockGPT predictions earns an annual return of 119% with a Sharpe ratio of 6.5. The StockGPT-based portfolio completely spans momentum and long-/short-term reversals, eliminating the need for manually crafted price-based strategies, and also encompasses most leading stock market factors. This highlights the immense promise of generative AI in surpassing human in making complex financial investment decisions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05101v2,,N,N,N,Y
Temporal Generalization Estimation in Evolving Graphs,07/04/2024,"Bin Lu, Tingyan Ma, Xiaoying Gan, Xinbing Wang, Yunqiang Zhu, Chenghu Zhou, Shiyu Liang","Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are widely deployed in vast fields, but they often struggle to maintain accurate representations as graphs evolve. We theoretically establish a lower bound, proving that under mild conditions, representation distortion inevitably occurs over time. To estimate the temporal distortion without human annotation after deployment, one naive approach is to pre-train a recurrent model (e.g., RNN) before deployment and use this model afterwards, but the estimation is far from satisfactory. In this paper, we analyze the representation distortion from an information theory perspective, and attribute it primarily to inaccurate feature extraction during evolution. Consequently, we introduce Smart, a straightforward and effective baseline enhanced by an adaptive feature extractor through self-supervised graph reconstruction. In synthetic random graphs, we further refine the former lower bound to show the inevitable distortion over time and empirically observe that Smart achieves good estimation performance. Moreover, we observe that Smart consistently shows outstanding generalization estimation on four real-world evolving graphs. The ablation studies underscore the necessity of graph reconstruction. For example, on OGB-arXiv dataset, the estimation metric MAPE deteriorates from 2.19% to 8.00% without reconstruction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04969v1,,N,N,N,N
TimeGPT in Load Forecasting: A Large Time Series Model Perspective,07/04/2024,"Wenlong Liao, Fernando Porte-Agel, Jiannong Fang, Christian Rehtanz, Shouxiang Wang, Dechang Yang, Zhe Yang","Machine learning models have made significant progress in load forecasting, but their forecast accuracy is limited in cases where historical load data is scarce. Inspired by the outstanding performance of large language models (LLMs) in computer vision and natural language processing, this paper aims to discuss the potential of large time series models in load forecasting with scarce historical data. Specifically, the large time series model is constructed as a time series generative pre-trained transformer (TimeGPT), which is trained on massive and diverse time series datasets consisting of 100 billion data points (e.g., finance, transportation, banking, web traffic, weather, energy, healthcare, etc.). Then, the scarce historical load data is used to fine-tune the TimeGPT, which helps it to adapt to the data distribution and characteristics associated with load forecasting. Simulation results show that TimeGPT outperforms the benchmarks (e.g., popular machine learning models and statistical models) for load forecasting on several real datasets with scarce training samples, particularly for short look-ahead times. However, it cannot be guaranteed that TimeGPT is always superior to benchmarks for load forecasting with scarce data, since the performance of TimeGPT may be affected by the distribution differences between the load data and the training data. In practical applications, we can divide the historical data into a training set and a validation set, and then use the validation set loss to decide whether TimeGPT is the best choice for a specific dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04885v1,,Y,N,N,Y
The Identification and Categorization of Anemia Through Artificial Neural Networks: A Comparative Analysis of Three Models,06/04/2024,Mohammed A. A.

A Novel Bi-LSTM And Transformer Architecture For Generating Tabla Music,06/04/2024,"Roopa Mayya, Vivekanand Venkataraman, Anwesh P R, Narayana Darapaneni","Introduction: Music generation is a complex task that has received significant attention in recent years, and deep learning techniques have shown promising results in this field. Objectives: While extensive work has been carried out on generating Piano and other Western music, there is limited research on generating classical Indian music due to the scarcity of Indian music in machine-encoded formats. In this technical paper, methods for generating classical Indian music, specifically tabla music, is proposed. Initially, this paper explores piano music generation using deep learning architectures. Then the fundamentals are extended to generating tabla music. Methods: Tabla music in waveform (.wav) files are pre-processed using the librosa library in Python. A novel Bi-LSTM with an Attention approach and a transformer model are trained on the extracted features and labels. Results: The models are then used to predict the next sequences of tabla music. A loss of 4.042 and MAE of 1.0814 are achieved with the Bi-LSTM model. With the transformer model, a loss of 55.9278 and MAE of 3.5173 are obtained for tabla music generation. Conclusion: The resulting music embodies a harmonious fusion of novelty and familiarity, pushing the limits of music composition to new horizons.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.05765v1,,N,N,N,N
Generalizable Temperature Nowcasting with Physics-Constrained RNNs for Predictive Maintenance of Wind Turbine Components,05/04/2024,"Johannes Exenberger, Matteo Di Salvo, Thomas Hirsch, Franz Wotawa, Gerald Schweiger","Machine learning plays an important role in the operation of current wind energy production systems. One central application is predictive maintenance to increase efficiency and lower electricity costs by reducing downtimes. Integrating physics-based knowledge in neural networks to enforce their physical plausibilty is a promising method to improve current approaches, but incomplete system information often impedes their application in real world scenarios. We describe a simple and efficient way for physics-constrained deep learning-based predictive maintenance for wind turbine gearbox bearings with partial system knowledge. The approach is based on temperature nowcasting constrained by physics, where unknown system coefficients are treated as learnable neural network parameters. Results show improved generalization performance to unseen environments compared to a baseline neural network, which is especially important in low data scenarios often encountered in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.04126v1,,N,N,N,Y
Conditional diffusion models for downscaling & bias correction of Earth system model precipitation,05/04/2024,"Michael Aich, Philipp Hess, Baoxiang Pan, Sebastian Bathiany, Yu Huang, Niklas Boers","Climate change exacerbates extreme weather events like heavy rainfall and flooding. As these events cause severe losses of property and lives, accurate high-resolution simulation of precipitation is imperative. However, existing Earth System Models (ESMs) struggle with resolving small-scale dynamics and suffer from biases, especially for extreme events. Traditional statistical bias correction and downscaling methods fall short in improving spatial structure, while recent deep learning methods lack controllability over the output and suffer from unstable training. Here, we propose a novel machine learning framework for simultaneous bias correction and downscaling. We train a generative diffusion model in a supervised way purely on observational data. We map observational and ESM data to a shared embedding space, where both are unbiased towards each other and train a conditional diffusion model to reverse the mapping. Our method can be used to correct any ESM field, as the training is independent of the ESM. Our approach ensures statistical fidelity, preserves large-scale spatial patterns and outperforms existing methods especially regarding extreme events and small-scale spatial features that are crucial for impact assessments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.14416v1,,N,N,N,Y
Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text,04/04/2024,"Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, Alex Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant","In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\""ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03626v1,,N,N,N,N
Elicitron: An LLM Agent-Based Simulation Framework for Design Requirements Elicitation,04/04/2024,"Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Hyunmin Cheong, Daniele Grandi, Ye Wang, Nigel Morris, Alexander Tessier","Requirements elicitation, a critical, yet time-consuming and challenging step in product development, often fails to capture the full spectrum of user needs. This may lead to products that fall short of expectations. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate and enhance the requirements elicitation process. LLMs are used to generate a vast array of simulated users (LLM agents), enabling the exploration of a much broader range of user needs and unforeseen use cases. These agents engage in product experience scenarios, through explaining their actions, observations, and challenges. Subsequent agent interviews and analysis uncover valuable user needs, including latent ones. We validate our framework with three experiments. First, we explore different methodologies for diverse agent generation, discussing their advantages and shortcomings. We measure the diversity of identified user needs and demonstrate that context-aware agent generation leads to greater diversity. Second, we show how our framework effectively mimics empathic lead user interviews, identifying a greater number of latent needs than conventional human interviews. Third, we showcase that LLMs can be used to analyze interviews, capture needs, and classify them as latent or not. Our work highlights the potential of using LLM agents to accelerate early-stage product development, reduce costs, and increase innovation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16045v1,,N,N,N,N
SENSOR: Imitate Third-Person Expert's Behaviors via Active Sensoring,04/04/2024,"Kaichen Huang, Minghao Shao, Shenghua Wan, Hai-Hang Sun, Shuai Feng, Le Gan, De-Chuan Zhan","In many real-world visual Imitation Learning (IL) scenarios, there is a misalignment between the agent's and the expert's perspectives, which might lead to the failure of imitation. Previous methods have generally solved this problem by domain alignment, which incurs extra computation and storage costs, and these methods fail to handle the \textit{hard cases} where the viewpoint gap is too large. To alleviate the above problems, we introduce active sensoring in the visual IL setting and propose a model-based SENSory imitatOR (SENSOR) to automatically change the agent's perspective to match the expert's. SENSOR jointly learns a world model to capture the dynamics of latent states, a sensor policy to control the camera, and a motor policy to control the agent. Experiments on visual locomotion tasks show that SENSOR can efficiently simulate the expert's perspective and strategy, and outperforms most baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03386v1,,N,N,N,N
Investigating the Robustness of Counterfactual Learning to Rank Models: A Reproducibility Study,04/04/2024,"Zechun Niu, Jiaxin Mao, Qingyao Ai, Ji-Rong Wen","Counterfactual learning to rank (CLTR) has attracted extensive attention in the IR community for its ability to leverage massive logged user interaction data to train ranking models. While the CLTR models can be theoretically unbiased when the user behavior assumption is correct and the propensity estimation is accurate, their effectiveness is usually empirically evaluated via simulation-based experiments due to a lack of widely-available, large-scale, real click logs. However, the mainstream simulation-based experiments are somewhat limited as they often feature a single, deterministic production ranker and simplified user simulation models to generate the synthetic click logs. As a result, the robustness of CLTR models in complex and diverse situations is largely unknown and needs further investigation. To address this problem, in this paper, we aim to investigate the robustness of existing CLTR models in a reproducibility study with extensive simulation-based experiments that (1) use both deterministic and stochastic production rankers, each with different ranking performance, and (2) leverage multiple user simulation models with different user behavior assumptions. We find that the DLA models and IPS-DCM show better robustness under various simulation settings than IPS-PBM and PRS with offline propensity estimation. Besides, the existing CLTR models often fail to outperform the naive click baselines when the production ranker has relatively high ranking performance or certain randomness, which suggests an urgent need for developing new CLTR algorithms that work for these settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.03707v1,,N,N,N,N
A Comprehensive Survey on Self-Supervised Learning for Recommendation,04/04/2024,"Xubin Ren, Wei Wei, Lianghao Xia, Chao Huang","Recommender systems play a crucial role in tackling the challenge of information overload by delivering personalized recommendations based on individual user preferences. Deep learning techniques, such as RNNs, GNNs, and Transformer architectures, have significantly propelled the advancement of recommender systems by enhancing their comprehension of user behaviors and preferences. However, supervised learning methods encounter challenges in real-life scenarios due to data sparsity, resulting in limitations in their ability to learn representations effectively. To address this, self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged as a solution, leveraging inherent data structures to generate supervision signals without relying solely on labeled data. By leveraging unlabeled data and extracting meaningful representations, recommender systems utilizing SSL can make accurate predictions and recommendations even when confronted with data sparsity. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of self-supervised learning frameworks designed for recommender systems, encompassing a thorough analysis of over 170 papers. We conduct an exploration of nine distinct scenarios, enabling a comprehensive understanding of SSL-enhanced recommenders in different contexts. For each domain, we elaborate on different self-supervised learning paradigms, namely contrastive learning, generative learning, and adversarial learning, so as to present technical details of how SSL enhances recommender systems in various contexts.

A Generative Deep Learning Approach for Crash Severity Modeling with Imbalanced Data,02/04/2024,"Junlan Chen, Ziyuan Pu, Nan Zheng, Xiao Wen, Hongliang Ding, Xiucheng Guo","Crash data is often greatly imbalanced, with the majority of crashes being non-fatal crashes, and only a small number being fatal crashes due to their rarity. Such data imbalance issue poses a challenge for crash severity modeling since it struggles to fit and interpret fatal crash outcomes with very limited samples. Usually, such data imbalance issues are addressed by data resampling methods, such as under-sampling and over-sampling techniques. However, most traditional and deep learning-based data resampling methods, such as synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) are designed dedicated to processing continuous variables. Though some resampling methods have improved to handle both continuous and discrete variables, they may have difficulties in dealing with the collapse issue associated with sparse discrete risk factors. Moreover, there is a lack of comprehensive studies that compare the performance of various resampling methods in crash severity modeling. To address the aforementioned issues, the current study proposes a crash data generation method based on the Conditional Tabular GAN. After data balancing, a crash severity model is employed to estimate the performance of classification and interpretation. A comparative study is conducted to assess classification accuracy and distribution consistency of the proposed generation method using a 4-year imbalanced crash dataset collected in Washington State, U.S. Additionally, Monte Carlo simulation is employed to estimate the performance of parameter and probability estimation in both two- and three-class imbalance scenarios. The results indicate that using synthetic data generated by CTGAN-RU for crash severity modeling outperforms using original data or synthetic data generated by other resampling methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.02187v1,,Y,N,N,Y

CtRL-Sim: Reactive and Controllable Driving Agents with Offline Reinforcement Learning,29/03/2024,"Luke Rowe, Roger Girgis, Anthony Gosselin, Bruno Carrez, Florian Golemo, Felix Heide, Liam Paull, Christopher Pal","Evaluating autonomous vehicle stacks (AVs) in simulation typically involves replaying driving logs from real-world recorded traffic. However, agents replayed from offline data do not react to the actions of the AV, and their behaviour cannot be easily controlled to simulate counterfactual scenarios. Existing approaches have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing methods that rely on heuristics or learned generative models of real-world data but these approaches either lack realism or necessitate costly iterative sampling procedures to control the generated behaviours. In this work, we take an alternative approach and propose CtRL-Sim, a method that leverages return-conditioned offline reinforcement learning within a physics-enhanced Nocturne simulator to efficiently generate reactive and controllable traffic agents. Specifically, we process real-world driving data through the Nocturne simulator to generate a diverse offline reinforcement learning dataset, annotated with various reward terms. With this dataset, we train a return-conditioned multi-agent behaviour model that allows for fine-grained manipulation of agent behaviours by modifying the desired returns for the various reward components. This capability enables the generation of a wide range of driving behaviours beyond the scope of the initial dataset, including those representing adversarial behaviours. We demonstrate that CtRL-Sim can efficiently generate diverse and realistic safety-critical scenarios while providing fine-grained control over agent behaviours. Further, we show that fine-tuning our model on simulated safety-critical scenarios generated by our model enhances this controllability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19918v1,,N,N,N,N
MambaMixer: Efficient Selective State Space Models with Dual Token and Channel Selection,29/03/2024,"Ali Behrouz, Michele Santacatterina, Ramin Zabih","Recent advances in deep learning have mainly relied on Transformers due to their data dependency and ability to learn at scale. The attention module in these architectures, however, exhibits quadratic time and space in input size, limiting their scalability for long-sequence modeling. Despite recent attempts to design efficient and effective architecture backbone for multi-dimensional data, such as images and multivariate time series, existing models are either data independent, or fail to allow inter- and intra-dimension communication. Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), and more specifically Selective State Space Models, with efficient hardware-aware implementation, have shown promising potential for long sequence modeling. Motivated by the success of SSMs, we present MambaMixer, a new architecture with data-dependent weights that uses a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels, called Selective Token and Channel Mixer. MambaMixer connects selective mixers using a weighted averaging mechanism, allowing layers to have direct access to early features. As a proof of concept, we design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) architectures based on the MambaMixer block and explore their performance in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. Our results underline the importance of selective mixing across both tokens and channels. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods while demonstrating significantly improved computational cost. These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and MLPs are sufficient for good performance in time series forecasting, neither is necessary.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19888v1,,N,N,N,Y
Gegenbauer Graph Neural Networks for Time-varying Signal Reconstruction,28/03/2024,"Jhon A. Castro-Correa, Jhony H. Giraldo, Mohsen Badiey, Fragkiskos D. Malliaros","Reconstructing time-varying graph signals (or graph time-series imputation) is a critical problem in machine learning and signal processing with broad applications, ranging from missing data imputation in sensor networks to time-series forecasting. Accurately capturing the spatio-temporal information inherent in these signals is crucial for effectively addressing these tasks. However, existing approaches relying on smoothness assumptions of temporal differences and simple convex optimization techniques have inherent limitations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that incorporates a learning module to enhance the accuracy of the downstream task. To this end, we introduce the Gegenbauer-based graph convolutional (GegenConv) operator, which is a generalization of the conventional Chebyshev graph convolution by leveraging the theory of Gegenbauer polynomials. By deviating from traditional convex problems, we expand the complexity of the model and offer a more accurate solution for recovering time-varying graph signals. Building upon GegenConv, we design the Gegenbauer-based time Graph Neural Network (GegenGNN) architecture, which adopts an encoder-decoder structure. Likewise, our approach also utilizes a dedicated loss function that incorporates a mean squared error component alongside Sobolev smoothness regularization. This combination enables GegenGNN to capture both the fidelity to ground truth and the underlying smoothness properties of the signals, enhancing the reconstruction performance. We conduct extensive experiments on real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The experimental results demonstrate that GegenGNN outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showcasing its superior capability in recovering time-varying graph signals.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19800v2,10.1109/TNNLS.2024.3381069,N,N,N,Y
InterDreamer: Zero-Shot Text to 3D Dynamic Human-Object Interaction,28/03/2024,"Sirui Xu, Ziyin Wang, Yu-Xiong Wang, Liang-Yan Gui","Text-conditioned human motion generation has experienced significant advancements with diffusion models trained on extensive motion capture data and corresponding textual annotations. However, extending such success to 3D dynamic human-object interaction (HOI) generation faces notable challenges, primarily due to the lack of large-scale interaction data and comprehensive descriptions that align with these interactions. This paper takes the initiative and showcases the potential of generating human-object interactions without direct training on text-interaction pair data. Our key insight in achieving this is that interaction semantics and dynamics can be decoupled. Being unable to learn interaction semantics through supervised training, we instead leverage pre-trained large models, synergizing knowledge from a large language model and a text-to-motion model. While such knowledge offers high-level control over interaction semantics, it cannot grasp the intricacies of low-level interaction dynamics. To overcome this issue, we further introduce a world model designed to comprehend simple physics, modeling how human actions influence object motion. By integrating these components, our novel framework, InterDreamer, is able to generate text-aligned 3D HOI sequences in a zero-shot manner. We apply InterDreamer to the BEHAVE and CHAIRS datasets, and our comprehensive experimental analysis demonstrates its capability to generate realistic and coherent interaction sequences that seamlessly align with the text directives.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19652v1,,N,N,N,N
Semantic Map-based Generation of Navigation Instructions,28/03/2024,"Chengzu Li, Chao Zhang, Simone Teufel, Rama Sanand Doddipatla, Svetlana Stoyanchev","We are interested in the generation of navigation instructions, either in their own right or as training material for robotic navigation task. In this paper, we propose a new approach to navigation instruction generation by framing the problem as an image captioning task using semantic maps as visual input. Conventional approaches employ a sequence of panorama images to generate navigation instructions. Semantic maps abstract away from visual details and fuse the information in multiple panorama images into a single top-down representation, thereby reducing computational complexity to process the input. We present a benchmark dataset for instruction generation using semantic maps, propose an initial model and ask human subjects to manually assess the quality of generated instructions. Our initial investigations show promise in using semantic maps for instruction generation instead of a sequence of panorama images, but there is vast scope for improvement.

Keypoint Action Tokens Enable In-Context Imitation Learning in Robotics,28/03/2024,"Norman Di Palo, Edward Johns","We show that off-the-shelf text-based Transformers, with no additional training, can perform few-shot in-context visual imitation learning, mapping visual observations to action sequences that emulate the demonstrator's behaviour. We achieve this by transforming visual observations (inputs) and trajectories of actions (outputs) into sequences of tokens that a text-pretrained Transformer (GPT-4 Turbo) can ingest and generate, via a framework we call Keypoint Action Tokens (KAT). Despite being trained only on language, we show that these Transformers excel at translating tokenised visual keypoint observations into action trajectories, performing on par or better than state-of-the-art imitation learning (diffusion policies) in the low-data regime on a suite of real-world, everyday tasks. Rather than operating in the language domain as is typical, KAT leverages text-based Transformers to operate in the vision and action domains to learn general patterns in demonstration data for highly efficient imitation learning, indicating promising new avenues for repurposing natural language models for embodied tasks.

Interpreting Key Mechanisms of Factual Recall in Transformer-Based Language Models,28/03/2024,"Ang Lv, Kaiyi Zhang, Yuhan Chen, Yulong Wang, Lifeng Liu, Ji-Rong Wen, Jian Xie, Rui Yan","In this paper, we deeply explore the mechanisms employed by Transformer-based language models in factual recall tasks. In zero-shot scenarios, given a prompt like ""The capital of France is,"" task-specific attention heads extract the topic entity, such as ""France,"" from the context and pass it to subsequent MLPs to recall the required answer such as ""Paris."" We introduce a novel analysis method aimed at decomposing the outputs of the MLP into components understandable by humans. Through this method, we quantify the function of the MLP layer following these task-specific heads. In the residual stream, it either erases or amplifies the information originating from individual heads. Moreover, it generates a component that redirects the residual stream towards the direction of its expected answer. These zero-shot mechanisms are also employed in few-shot scenarios. Additionally, we observed a widely existent anti-overconfidence mechanism in the final layer of models, which suppresses correct predictions. We mitigate this suppression by leveraging our interpretation to improve factual recall performance. Our interpretations have been evaluated across various language models, from the GPT-2 families to 1.3B OPT, and across tasks covering different domains of factual knowledge.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19521v2,,N,N,N,N
RiEMann: Near Real-Time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Manipulation without Point Cloud Segmentation,28/03/2024,"Chongkai Gao, Zhengrong Xue, Shuying Deng, Tianhai Liang, Siqi Yang, Lin Shao, Huazhe Xu","We present RiEMann, an end-to-end near Real-time SE(3)-Equivariant Robot Manipulation imitation learning framework from scene point cloud input. Compared to previous methods that rely on descriptor field matching, RiEMann directly predicts the target poses of objects for manipulation without any object segmentation. RiEMann learns a manipulation task from scratch with 5 to 10 demonstrations, generalizes to unseen SE(3) transformations and instances of target objects, resists visual interference of distracting objects, and follows the near real-time pose change of the target object. The scalable action space of RiEMann facilitates the addition of custom equivariant actions such as the direction of turning the faucet, which makes articulated object manipulation possible for RiEMann. In simulation and real-world 6-DOF robot manipulation experiments, we test RiEMann on 5 categories of manipulation tasks with a total of 25 variants and show that RiEMann outperforms baselines in both task success rates and SE(3) geodesic distance errors on predicted poses (reduced by 68.6%), and achieves a 5.4 frames per second (FPS) network inference speed.

Constants of Motion for Conserved and Non-conserved Dynamics,28/03/2024,Michael F. Zimmer,"This paper begins with a dynamical model that was obtained by applying a machine learning technique (FJet) to time-series data; this dynamical model is then analyzed with Lie symmetry techniques to obtain constants of motion. This analysis is performed on both the conserved and non-conserved cases of the 1D and 2D harmonic oscillators. For the 1D oscillator, constants are found in the cases where the system is underdamped, overdamped, and critically damped. The novel existence of such a constant for a non-conserved model is interpreted as a manifestation of the conservation of energy of the {\em total} system (i.e., oscillator plus dissipative environment). For the 2D oscillator, constants are found for the isotropic and anisotropic cases, including when the frequencies are incommensurate; it is also generalized to arbitrary dimensions. In addition, a constant is identified which generalizes angular momentum for all ratios of the frequencies. The approach presented here can produce {\em multiple} constants of motion from a {\em single}, generic data set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19418v1,,N,N,N,Y
Breaking the Length Barrier: LLM-Enhanced CTR Prediction in Long Textual User Behaviors,28/03/2024,"Binzong Geng, Zhaoxin Huan, Xiaolu Zhang, Yong He, Liang Zhang, Fajie Yuan, Jun Zhou, Linjian Mo","With the rise of large language models (LLMs), recent works have leveraged LLMs to improve the performance of click-through rate (CTR) prediction. However, we argue that a critical obstacle remains in deploying LLMs for practical use: the efficiency of LLMs when processing long textual user behaviors. As user sequences grow longer, the current efficiency of LLMs is inadequate for training on billions of users and items. To break through the efficiency barrier of LLMs, we propose Behavior Aggregated Hierarchical Encoding (BAHE) to enhance the efficiency of LLM-based CTR modeling. Specifically, BAHE proposes a novel hierarchical architecture that decouples the encoding of user behaviors from inter-behavior interactions. Firstly, to prevent computational redundancy from repeated encoding of identical user behaviors, BAHE employs the LLM's pre-trained shallow layers to extract embeddings of the most granular, atomic user behaviors from extensive user sequences and stores them in the offline database. Subsequently, the deeper, trainable layers of the LLM facilitate intricate inter-behavior interactions, thereby generating comprehensive user embeddings. This separation allows the learning of high-level user representations to be independent of low-level behavior encoding, significantly reducing computational complexity. Finally, these refined user embeddings, in conjunction with correspondingly processed item embeddings, are incorporated into the CTR model to compute the CTR scores. Extensive experimental results show that BAHE reduces training time and memory by five times for CTR models using LLMs, especially with longer user sequences. BAHE has been deployed in a real-world system, allowing for daily updates of 50 million CTR data on 8 A100 GPUs, making LLMs practical for industrial CTR prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19347v1,,N,N,N,N
IVLMap: Instance-Aware Visual Language Grounding for Consumer Robot Navigation,28/03/2024,"Jiacui Huang, Hongtao Zhang, Mingbo Zhao, Zhou Wu","Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is a challenging task that requires a robot to navigate in photo-realistic environments with human natural language promptings. Recent studies aim to handle this task by constructing the semantic spatial map representation of the environment, and then leveraging the strong ability of reasoning in large language models for generalizing code for guiding the robot navigation. However, these methods face limitations in instance-level and attribute-level navigation tasks as they cannot distinguish different instances of the same object. To address this challenge, we propose a new method, namely, Instance-aware Visual Language Map (IVLMap), to empower the robot with instance-level and attribute-level semantic mapping, where it is autonomously constructed by fusing the RGBD video data collected from the robot agent with special-designed natural language map indexing in the bird's-in-eye view. Such indexing is instance-level and attribute-level. In particular, when integrated with a large language model, IVLMap demonstrates the capability to i) transform natural language into navigation targets with instance and attribute information, enabling precise localization, and ii) accomplish zero-shot end-to-end navigation tasks based on natural language commands. Extensive navigation experiments are conducted. Simulation results illustrate that our method can achieve an average improvement of 14.4\% in navigation accuracy.

Fine-Tuning Language Models with Reward Learning on Policy,28/03/2024,"Hao Lang, Fei Huang, Yongbin Li","Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as an effective approach to aligning large language models (LLMs) to human preferences. RLHF contains three steps, i.e., human preference collecting, reward learning, and policy optimization, which are usually performed serially. Despite its popularity, however, (fixed) reward models may suffer from inaccurate off-distribution, since policy optimization continuously shifts LLMs' data distribution. Repeatedly collecting new preference data from the latest LLMs may alleviate this issue, which unfortunately makes the resulting system more complicated and difficult to optimize. In this paper, we propose reward learning on policy (RLP), an unsupervised framework that refines a reward model using policy samples to keep it on-distribution. Specifically, an unsupervised multi-view learning method is introduced to learn robust representations of policy samples. Meanwhile, a synthetic preference generation approach is developed to simulate high-quality preference data with policy outputs. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that RLP consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art.

STaR-GATE: Teaching Language Models to Ask Clarifying Questions,28/03/2024,"Chinmaya Andukuri, Jan-Philipp Fr√§nken, Tobias Gerstenberg, Noah D. Goodman","When prompting language models to complete a task, users often leave important aspects unsaid. While asking questions could resolve this ambiguity (GATE; Li et al., 2023), models often struggle to ask good questions. We explore a language model's ability to self-improve (STaR; Zelikman et al., 2022) by rewarding the model for generating useful questions-a simple method we dub STaR-GATE. We generate a synthetic dataset of 25,500 unique persona-task prompts to simulate conversations between a pretrained language model-the Questioner-and a Roleplayer whose preferences are unknown to the Questioner. By asking questions, the Questioner elicits preferences from the Roleplayer. The Questioner is iteratively finetuned on questions that increase the probability of high-quality responses to the task, which are generated by an Oracle with access to the Roleplayer's latent preferences. After two iterations of self-improvement, the Questioner asks better questions, allowing it to generate responses that are preferred over responses from the initial model on 72% of tasks. Our results indicate that teaching a language model to ask better questions leads to better personalized responses.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19154v2,,N,N,N,N
Topological Cycle Graph Attention Network for Brain Functional Connectivity,28/03/2024,"Jinghan Huang, Nanguang Chen, Anqi Qiu","This study, we introduce a novel Topological Cycle Graph Attention Network (CycGAT), designed to delineate a functional backbone within brain functional graph--key pathways essential for signal transmissio--from non-essential, redundant connections that form cycles around this core structure. We first introduce a cycle incidence matrix that establishes an independent cycle basis within a graph, mapping its relationship with edges. We propose a cycle graph convolution that leverages a cycle adjacency matrix, derived from the cycle incidence matrix, to specifically filter edge signals in a domain of cycles. Additionally, we strengthen the representation power of the cycle graph convolution by adding an attention mechanism, which is further augmented by the introduction of edge positional encodings in cycles, to enhance the topological awareness of CycGAT. We demonstrate CycGAT's localization through simulation and its efficacy on an ABCD study's fMRI data (n=8765), comparing it with baseline models. CycGAT outperforms these models, identifying a functional backbone with significantly fewer cycles, crucial for understanding neural circuits related to general intelligence.

"Meta-Learning with Generalized Ridge Regression: High-dimensional Asymptotics, Optimality and Hyper-covariance Estimation",27/03/2024,"Yanhao Jin, Krishnakumar Balasubramanian, Debashis Paul","Meta-learning involves training models on a variety of training tasks in a way that enables them to generalize well on new, unseen test tasks. In this work, we consider meta-learning within the framework of high-dimensional multivariate random-effects linear models and study generalized ridge-regression based predictions. The statistical intuition of using generalized ridge regression in this setting is that the covariance structure of the random regression coefficients could be leveraged to make better predictions on new tasks. Accordingly, we first characterize the precise asymptotic behavior of the predictive risk for a new test task when the data dimension grows proportionally to the number of samples per task. We next show that this predictive risk is optimal when the weight matrix in generalized ridge regression is chosen to be the inverse of the covariance matrix of random coefficients. Finally, we propose and analyze an estimator of the inverse covariance matrix of random regression coefficients based on data from the training tasks. As opposed to intractable MLE-type estimators, the proposed estimators could be computed efficiently as they could be obtained by solving (global) geodesically-convex optimization problems. Our analysis and methodology use tools from random matrix theory and Riemannian optimization. Simulation results demonstrate the improved generalization performance of the proposed method on new unseen test tasks within the considered framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19720v1,,N,N,N,N
Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation Learning for Text-to-Image Generation,27/03/2024,"Jingtao Zhan, Qingyao Ai, Yiqun Liu, Jia Chen, Shaoping Ma","Text-to-image generation systems have emerged as revolutionary tools in the realm of artistic creation, offering unprecedented ease in transforming textual prompts into visual art. However, the efficacy of these systems is intricately linked to the quality of user-provided prompts, which often poses a challenge to users unfamiliar with prompt crafting. This paper addresses this challenge by leveraging user reformulation data from interaction logs to develop an automatic prompt reformulation model. Our in-depth analysis of these logs reveals that user prompt reformulation is heavily dependent on the individual user's capability, resulting in significant variance in the quality of reformulation pairs. To effectively use this data for training, we introduce the Capability-aware Prompt Reformulation (CAPR) framework. CAPR innovatively integrates user capability into the reformulation process through two key components: the Conditional Reformulation Model (CRM) and Configurable Capability Features (CCF). CRM reformulates prompts according to a specified user capability, as represented by CCF. The CCF, in turn, offers the flexibility to tune and guide the CRM's behavior. This enables CAPR to effectively learn diverse reformulation strategies across various user capacities and to simulate high-capability user reformulation during inference. Extensive experiments on standard text-to-image generation benchmarks showcase CAPR's superior performance over existing baselines and its remarkable robustness on unseen systems. Furthermore, comprehensive analyses validate the effectiveness of different components. CAPR can facilitate user-friendly interaction with text-to-image systems and make advanced artistic creation more achievable for a broader range of users.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.19716v1,,N,N,N,N
Predicting Energy Budgets in Droplet Dynamics: A Recurrent Neural Network Approach,24/03/2024,"Diego A. de Aguiar, Hugo L. Fran√ßa, Cassio M. Oishi","Neural networks in fluid mechanics offer an efficient approach for exploring complex flows, including multiphase and free surface flows. The recurrent neural network, particularly the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, proves attractive for learning mappings from transient inputs to dynamic outputs. This study applies LSTM to predict transient and static outputs for fluid flows under surface tension effects. Specifically, we explore two distinct droplet dynamic scenarios: droplets with diverse initial shapes impacting with solid surfaces, as well as the coalescence of two droplets following collision. Using only dimensionless numbers and geometric time series data from numerical simulations, LSTM predicts the energy budget. The marker-and-cell front-tracking methodology combined with a marker-and-cell finite-difference strategy is adopted for simulating the droplet dynamics. Using a recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture fed with time series data derived from geometrical parameters, as for example droplet diameter variation, our study shows the accuracy of our approach in predicting energy budgets, as for instance the kinetic, dissipation, and surface energy trends, across a range of Reynolds and Weber numbers in droplet dynamic problems. Finally, a two-phase sequential neural network using only geometric data, which is readily available in experimental settings, is employed to predict the energies and then use them to estimate static parameters, such as the Reynolds and Weber numbers. While our methodology has been primarily validated with simulation data, its adaptability to experimental datasets is a promising avenue for future exploration. We hope that our strategy can be useful for diverse applications, spanning from inkjet printing to combustion engines, where the prediction of energy budgets or dissipation energies is crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.16144v1,,N,N,N,Y
SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series,22/03/2024,"Badri N. Patro, Vijay S. Agneeswaran","Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

An Analysis of Linear Time Series Forecasting Models,21/03/2024,"William Toner, Luke Darlow","Despite their simplicity, linear models perform well at time series forecasting, even when pitted against deeper and more expensive models. A number of variations to the linear model have been proposed, often including some form of feature normalisation that improves model generalisation. In this paper we analyse the sets of functions expressible using these linear model architectures. In so doing we show that several popular variants of linear models for time series forecasting are equivalent and functionally indistinguishable from standard, unconstrained linear regression. We characterise the model classes for each linear variant. We demonstrate that each model can be reinterpreted as unconstrained linear regression over a suitably augmented feature set, and therefore admit closed-form solutions when using a mean-squared loss function. We provide experimental evidence that the models under inspection learn nearly identical solutions, and finally demonstrate that the simpler closed form solutions are superior forecasters across 72% of test settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14587v2,,N,N,N,N
Heuristic Algorithm-based Action Masking Reinforcement Learning (HAAM-RL) with Ensemble Inference Method,21/03/2024,"Kyuwon Choi, Cheolkyun Rho, Taeyoun Kim, Daewoo Choi","This paper presents a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach called HAAM-RL (Heuristic Algorithm-based Action Masking Reinforcement Learning) for optimizing the color batching re-sequencing problem in automobile painting processes.

Our methodology incorporates several key techniques including a tailored Markov Decision Process (MDP) formulation, reward setting including Potential-Based Reward Shaping, action masking using heuristic algorithms (HAAM-RL), and an ensemble inference method that combines multiple RL models.

Protein Conformation Generation via Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion Models,21/03/2024,"Yan Wang, Lihao Wang, Yuning Shen, Yiqun Wang, Huizhuo Yuan, Yue Wu, Quanquan Gu","The conformational landscape of proteins is crucial to understanding their functionality in complex biological processes. Traditional physics-based computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from rare event sampling and long equilibration time problems, hindering their applications in general protein systems. Recently, deep generative modeling techniques, especially diffusion models, have been employed to generate novel protein conformations. However, existing score-based diffusion methods cannot properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge to guide the generation process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein conformations from the equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we propose a force-guided SE(3) diffusion model, ConfDiff, for protein conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with a mixture of data-based score models, ConfDiff can can generate protein conformations with rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14088v1,,N,N,N,N
Learning-based Multi-continuum Model for Multiscale Flow Problems,21/03/2024,"Fan Wang, Yating Wang, Wing Tat Leung, Zongben Xu","Multiscale problems can usually be approximated through numerical homogenization by an equation with some effective parameters that can capture the macroscopic behavior of the original system on the coarse grid to speed up the simulation. However, this approach usually assumes scale separation and that the heterogeneity of the solution can be approximated by the solution average in each coarse block. For complex multiscale problems, the computed single effective properties/continuum might be inadequate. In this paper, we propose a novel learning-based multi-continuum model to enrich the homogenized equation and improve the accuracy of the single continuum model for multiscale problems with some given data. Without loss of generalization, we consider a two-continuum case. The first flow equation keeps the information of the original homogenized equation with an additional interaction term. The second continuum is newly introduced, and the effective permeability in the second flow equation is determined by a neural network. The interaction term between the two continua aligns with that used in the Dual-porosity model but with a learnable coefficient determined by another neural network. The new model with neural network terms is then optimized using trusted data. We discuss both direct back-propagation and the adjoint method for the PDE-constraint optimization problem. Our proposed learning-based multi-continuum model can resolve multiple interacted media within each coarse grid block and describe the mass transfer among them, and it has been demonstrated to significantly improve the simulation results through numerical experiments involving both linear and nonlinear flow equations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14084v1,,N,N,N,N

The study investigates the ability of flow based neural networks to improve signal extraction of $\Lambda$ Hyperons at CLAS12. Normalizing Flows can help model complex probability density functions that describe physics processes, enabling uses such as event generation. $\Lambda$ signal extraction has been improved through the use of classifier networks, but differences in simulation and data domains limit classifier performance; this study utilizes the flows for domain adaptation between Monte Carlo simulation and data. We were successful in training a flow network to transform between the latent physics space and a normal distribution. We also found that applying the flows lessened the dependence of the figure of merit on the cut on the classifier output, meaning that there was a broader range where the cut results in a similar figure of merit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14076v1,,N,N,N,N
DiffSTOCK: Probabilistic relational Stock Market Predictions using Diffusion Models,21/03/2024,"Divyanshu Daiya, Monika Yadav, Harshit Singh Rao","In this work, we propose an approach to generalize denoising diffusion probabilistic models for stock market predictions and portfolio management. Present works have demonstrated the efficacy of modeling interstock relations for market time-series forecasting and utilized Graph-based learning models for value prediction and portfolio management. Though convincing, these deterministic approaches still fall short of handling uncertainties i.e., due to the low signal-to-noise ratio of the financial data, it is quite challenging to learn effective deterministic models. Since the probabilistic methods have shown to effectively emulate higher uncertainties for time-series predictions. To this end, we showcase effective utilisation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), to develop an architecture for providing better market predictions conditioned on the historical financial indicators and inter-stock relations.

Extracting Emotion Phrases from Tweets using BART,21/03/2024,Mahdi Rezapour,"Sentiment analysis is a natural language processing task that aims to identify and extract the emotional aspects of a text. However, many existing sentiment analysis methods primarily classify the overall polarity of a text, overlooking the specific phrases that convey sentiment. In this paper, we applied an approach to sentiment analysis based on a question-answering framework. Our approach leverages the power of Bidirectional Autoregressive Transformer (BART), a pre-trained sequence-to-sequence model, to extract a phrase from a given text that amplifies a given sentiment polarity. We create a natural language question that identifies the specific emotion to extract and then guide BART to pay attention to the relevant emotional cues in the text. We use a classifier within BART to predict the start and end positions of the answer span within the text, which helps to identify the precise boundaries of the extracted emotion phrase. Our approach offers several advantages over most sentiment analysis studies, including capturing the complete context and meaning of the text and extracting precise token spans that highlight the intended sentiment. We achieved an end loss of 87% and Jaccard score of 0.61.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14050v2,,N,N,N,N
A Roadmap Towards Automated and Regulated Robotic Systems,21/03/2024,"Yihao Liu, Mehran Armand","The rapid development of generative technology opens up possibility for higher level of automation, and artificial intelligence (AI) embodiment in robotic systems is imminent. However, due to the blackbox nature of the generative technology, the generation of the knowledge and workflow scheme is uncontrolled, especially in a dynamic environment and a complex scene. This poses challenges to regulations in safety-demanding applications such as medical scenes. We argue that the unregulated generative processes from AI is fitted for low level end tasks, but intervention in the form of manual or automated regulation should happen post-workflow-generation and pre-robotic-execution. To address this, we propose a roadmap that can lead to fully automated and regulated robotic systems. In this paradigm, the high level policies are generated as structured graph data, enabling regulatory oversight and reusability, while the code base for lower level tasks is generated by generative models. Our approach aims the transitioning from expert knowledge to regulated action, akin to the iterative processes of study, practice, scrutiny, and execution in human tasks. We identify the generative and deterministic processes in a design cycle, where generative processes serve as a text-based world simulator and the deterministic processes generate the executable system. We propose State Machine Seralization Language (SMSL) to be the conversion point between text simulator and executable workflow control. From there, we analyze the modules involved based on the current literature, and discuss human in the loop. As a roadmap, this work identifies the current possible implementation and future work. This work does not provide an implemented system but envisions to inspire the researchers working on the direction in the roadmap. We implement the SMSL and D-SFO paradigm that serve as the starting point of the roadmap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.14049v1,,N,N,N,N

Probabilistic Forecasting with Stochastic Interpolants and F√∂llmer Processes,20/03/2024,"Yifan Chen, Mark Goldstein, Mengjian Hua, Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas M. Boffi, Eric Vanden-Eijnden","We propose a framework for probabilistic forecasting of dynamical systems based on generative modeling. Given observations of the system state over time, we formulate the forecasting problem as sampling from the conditional distribution of the future system state given its current state. To this end, we leverage the framework of stochastic interpolants, which facilitates the construction of a generative model between an arbitrary base distribution and the target. We design a fictitious, non-physical stochastic dynamics that takes as initial condition the current system state and produces as output a sample from the target conditional distribution in finite time and without bias. This process therefore maps a point mass centered at the current state onto a probabilistic ensemble of forecasts. We prove that the drift coefficient entering the stochastic differential equation (SDE) achieving this task is non-singular, and that it can be learned efficiently by square loss regression over the time-series data. We show that the drift and the diffusion coefficients of this SDE can be adjusted after training, and that a specific choice that minimizes the impact of the estimation error gives a F\""ollmer process. We highlight the utility of our approach on several complex, high-dimensional forecasting problems, including stochastically forced Navier-Stokes and video prediction on the KTH and CLEVRER datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13724v1,,Y,N,N,Y

Multimodal Variational Autoencoder for Low-cost Cardiac Hemodynamics Instability Detection,20/03/2024,"Mohammod N. I. Suvon, Prasun C. Tripathi, Wenrui Fan, Shuo Zhou, Xianyuan Liu, Samer Alabed, Venet Osmani, Andrew J. Swift, Chen Chen, Haiping Lu","Recent advancements in non-invasive detection of cardiac hemodynamic instability (CHDI) primarily focus on applying machine learning techniques to a single data modality, e.g. cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Despite their potential, these approaches often fall short especially when the size of labeled patient data is limited, a common challenge in the medical domain. Furthermore, only a few studies have explored multimodal methods to study CHDI, which mostly rely on costly modalities such as cardiac MRI and echocardiogram. In response to these limitations, we propose a novel multimodal variational autoencoder ($\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$) to integrate low-cost chest X-ray (CXR) and electrocardiogram (ECG) modalities with pre-training on a large unlabeled dataset. Specifically, $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ introduces a novel tri-stream pre-training strategy to learn both shared and modality-specific features, thus enabling fine-tuning with both unimodal and multimodal datasets. We pre-train $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ on a large, unlabeled dataset of $50,982$ subjects from a subset of MIMIC database and then fine-tune the pre-trained model on a labeled dataset of $795$ subjects from the ASPIRE registry. Comprehensive evaluations against existing methods show that $\text{CardioVAE}_\text{X,G}$ offers promising performance (AUROC $=0.79$ and Accuracy $=0.77$), representing a significant step forward in non-invasive prediction of CHDI. Our model also excels in producing fine interpretations of predictions directly associated with clinical features, thereby supporting clinical decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13658v1,,N,N,N,Y
Find n' Propagate: Open-Vocabulary 3D Object Detection in Urban Environments,20/03/2024,"Djamahl Etchegaray, Zi Huang, Tatsuya Harada, Yadan Luo","In this work, we tackle the limitations of current LiDAR-based 3D object detection systems, which are hindered by a restricted class vocabulary and the high costs associated with annotating new object classes. Our exploration of open-vocabulary (OV) learning in urban environments aims to capture novel instances using pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with multi-sensor data. We design and benchmark a set of four potential solutions as baselines, categorizing them into either top-down or bottom-up approaches based on their input data strategies. While effective, these methods exhibit certain limitations, such as missing novel objects in 3D box estimation or applying rigorous priors, leading to biases towards objects near the camera or of rectangular geometries. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a universal \textsc{Find n' Propagate} approach for 3D OV tasks, aimed at maximizing the recall of novel objects and propagating this detection capability to more distant areas thereby progressively capturing more. In particular, we utilize a greedy box seeker to search against 3D novel boxes of varying orientations and depth in each generated frustum and ensure the reliability of newly identified boxes by cross alignment and density ranker. Additionally, the inherent bias towards camera-proximal objects is alleviated by the proposed remote simulator, which randomly diversifies pseudo-labeled novel instances in the self-training process, combined with the fusion of base samples in the memory bank. Extensive experiments demonstrate a 53% improvement in novel recall across diverse OV settings, VLMs, and 3D detectors. Notably, we achieve up to a 3.97-fold increase in Average Precision (AP) for novel object classes.

Motion Generation from Fine-grained Textual Descriptions,20/03/2024,"Kunhang Li, Yansong Feng","The task of text2motion is to generate human motion sequences from given textual descriptions, where the model explores diverse mappings from natural language instructions to human body movements. While most existing works are confined to coarse-grained motion descriptions, e.g., ""A man squats."", fine-grained descriptions specifying movements of relevant body parts are barely explored. Models trained with coarse-grained texts may not be able to learn mappings from fine-grained motion-related words to motion primitives, resulting in the failure to generate motions from unseen descriptions. In this paper, we build a large-scale language-motion dataset specializing in fine-grained textual descriptions, FineHumanML3D, by feeding GPT-3.5-turbo with step-by-step instructions with pseudo-code compulsory checks. Accordingly, we design a new text2motion model, FineMotionDiffuse, making full use of fine-grained textual information. Our quantitative evaluation shows that FineMotionDiffuse trained on FineHumanML3D improves FID by a large margin of 0.38, compared with competitive baselines. According to the qualitative evaluation and case study, our model outperforms MotionDiffuse in generating spatially or chronologically composite motions, by learning the implicit mappings from fine-grained descriptions to the corresponding basic motions. We release our data at https://github.com/KunhangL/finemotiondiffuse.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13518v2,,N,N,N,Y
Deepfake Detection without Deepfakes: Generalization via Synthetic Frequency Patterns Injection,20/03/2024,"Davide Alessandro Coccomini, Roberto Caldelli, Claudio Gennaro, Giuseppe Fiameni, Giuseppe Amato, Fabrizio Falchi","Deepfake detectors are typically trained on large sets of pristine and generated images, resulting in limited generalization capacity; they excel at identifying deepfakes created through methods encountered during training but struggle with those generated by unknown techniques. This paper introduces a learning approach aimed at significantly enhancing the generalization capabilities of deepfake detectors. Our method takes inspiration from the unique ""fingerprints"" that image generation processes consistently introduce into the frequency domain. These fingerprints manifest as structured and distinctly recognizable frequency patterns. We propose to train detectors using only pristine images injecting in part of them crafted frequency patterns, simulating the effects of various deepfake generation techniques without being specific to any. These synthetic patterns are based on generic shapes, grids, or auras. We evaluated our approach using diverse architectures across 25 different generation methods. The models trained with our approach were able to perform state-of-the-art deepfake detection, demonstrating also superior generalization capabilities in comparison with previous methods. Indeed, they are untied to any specific generation technique and can effectively identify deepfakes regardless of how they were made.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13479v1,,N,N,N,N
Detecting and Triaging Spoofing using Temporal Convolutional Networks,20/03/2024,"Kaushalya Kularatnam, Tania Stathaki","As algorithmic trading and electronic markets continue to transform the landscape of financial markets, detecting and deterring rogue agents to maintain a fair and efficient marketplace is crucial. The explosion of large datasets and the continually changing tricks of the trade make it difficult to adapt to new market conditions and detect bad actors. To that end, we propose a framework that can be adapted easily to various problems in the space of detecting market manipulation. Our approach entails initially employing a labelling algorithm which we use to create a training set to learn a weakly supervised model to identify potentially suspicious sequences of order book states. The main goal here is to learn a representation of the order book that can be used to easily compare future events. Subsequently, we posit the incorporation of expert assessment to scrutinize specific flagged order book states. In the event of an expert's unavailability, recourse is taken to the application of a more complex algorithm on the identified suspicious order book states. We then conduct a similarity search between any new representation of the order book against the expert labelled representations to rank the results of the weak learner. We show some preliminary results that are promising to explore further in this direction",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13429v1,,N,N,N,Y
USE: Dynamic User Modeling with Stateful Sequence Models,20/03/2024,"Zhihan Zhou, Qixiang Fang, Leonardo Neves, Francesco Barbieri, Yozen Liu, Han Liu, Maarten W. Bos, Ron Dotsch","User embeddings play a crucial role in user engagement forecasting and personalized services. Recent advances in sequence modeling have sparked interest in learning user embeddings from behavioral data. Yet behavior-based user embedding learning faces the unique challenge of dynamic user modeling. As users continuously interact with the apps, user embeddings should be periodically updated to account for users' recent and long-term behavior patterns. Existing methods highly rely on stateless sequence models that lack memory of historical behavior. They have to either discard historical data and use only the most recent data or reprocess the old and new data jointly. Both cases incur substantial computational overhead. To address this limitation, we introduce User Stateful Embedding (USE). USE generates user embeddings and reflects users' evolving behaviors without the need for exhaustive reprocessing by storing previous model states and revisiting them in the future. Furthermore, we introduce a novel training objective named future W-behavior prediction to transcend the limitations of next-token prediction by forecasting a broader horizon of upcoming user behaviors. By combining it with the Same User Prediction, a contrastive learning-based objective that predicts whether different segments of behavior sequences belong to the same user, we further improve the embeddings' distinctiveness and representativeness. We conducted experiments on 8 downstream tasks using Snapchat users' behavioral logs in both static (i.e., fixed user behavior sequences) and dynamic (i.e., periodically updated user behavior sequences) settings. We demonstrate USE's superior performance over established baselines. The results underscore USE's effectiveness and efficiency in integrating historical and recent user behavior sequences into user embeddings in dynamic user modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13344v1,,N,N,N,Y

Unlike prior LLM works in healthcare focusing on tasks like question answering, our work specifically focuses on long multi-turn voice conversations. Our one-trillion parameter constellation system is composed of several multibillion parameter LLMs as co-operative agents: a stateful primary agent that focuses on driving an engaging conversation and several specialist support agents focused on healthcare tasks performed by nurses to increase safety and reduce hallucinations. We develop a sophisticated training protocol for iterative co-training of the agents that optimize for diverse objectives. We train our models on proprietary data, clinical care plans, healthcare regulatory documents, medical manuals, and other medical reasoning documents. We align our models to speak like medical professionals, using organic healthcare conversations and simulated ones between patient actors and experienced nurses. This allows our system to express unique capabilities such as rapport building, trust building, empathy and bedside manner. Finally, we present the first comprehensive clinician evaluation of an LLM system for healthcare. We recruited over 1100 U.S. licensed nurses and over 130 U.S. licensed physicians to perform end-to-end conversational evaluations of our system by posing as patients and rating the system on several measures. We demonstrate Polaris performs on par with human nurses on aggregate across dimensions such as medical safety, clinical readiness, conversational quality, and bedside manner.

Bridging scales in multiscale bubble growth dynamics with correlated fluctuations using neural operator learning,20/03/2024,"Minglei Lu, Chensen Lin, Martian Maxey, George Karniadakis, Zhen Li","The intricate process of bubble growth dynamics involves a broad spectrum of physical phenomena from microscale mechanics of bubble formation to macroscale interplay between bubbles and surrounding thermo-hydrodynamics. Traditional bubble dynamics models including atomistic approaches and continuum-based methods segment the bubble dynamics into distinct scale-specific models. In order to bridge the gap between microscale stochastic fluid models and continuum-based fluid models for bubble dynamics, we develop a composite neural operator model to unify the analysis of nonlinear bubble dynamics across microscale and macroscale regimes by integrating a many-body dissipative particle dynamics (mDPD) model with a continuum-based Rayleigh-Plesset (RP) model through a novel neural network architecture, which consists of a deep operator network for learning the mean behavior of bubble growth subject to pressure variations and a long short-term memory network for learning the statistical features of correlated fluctuations in microscale bubble dynamics. Training and testing data are generated by conducting mDPD and RP simulations for nonlinear bubble dynamics with initial bubble radii ranging from 0.1 to 1.5 micrometers. Results show that the trained composite neural operator model can accurately predict bubble dynamics across scales, with a 99% accuracy for the time evaluation of the bubble radius under varying external pressure while containing correct size-dependent stochastic fluctuations in microscale bubble growth dynamics. The composite neural operator is the first deep learning surrogate for multiscale bubble growth dynamics that can capture correct stochastic fluctuations in microscopic fluid phenomena, which sets a new direction for future research in multiscale fluid dynamics modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13299v1,,N,N,N,Y
Federated reinforcement learning for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization,20/03/2024,"Zhenyuan Yuan, Siyuan Xu, Minghui Zhu","This paper considers the problem of learning a control policy for robot motion planning with zero-shot generalization, i.e., no data collection and policy adaptation is needed when the learned policy is deployed in new environments. We develop a federated reinforcement learning framework that enables collaborative learning of multiple learners and a central server, i.e., the Cloud, without sharing their raw data. In each iteration, each learner uploads its local control policy and the corresponding estimated normalized arrival time to the Cloud, which then computes the global optimum among the learners and broadcasts the optimal policy to the learners. Each learner then selects between its local control policy and that from the Cloud for next iteration. The proposed framework leverages on the derived zero-shot generalization guarantees on arrival time and safety. Theoretical guarantees on almost-sure convergence, almost consensus, Pareto improvement and optimality gap are also provided. Monte Carlo simulation is conducted to evaluate the proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13245v2,,N,N,N,N
A Comparative Study of Machine Learning Models Predicting Energetics of Interacting Defects,20/03/2024,Hao Yu,"Interacting defect systems are ubiquitous in materials under realistic scenarios, yet gaining an atomic-level understanding of these systems from a computational perspective is challenging - it often demands substantial resources due to the necessity of employing supercell calculations. While machine learning techniques have shown potential in accelerating materials simulations, their application to systems involving interacting defects remains relatively rare. In this work, we present a comparative study of three different methods to predict the free energy change of systems with interacting defects. We leveraging a limited dataset from Density Functional Theory(DFT) calculations to assess the performance models using materials descriptors, graph neural networks and cluster expansion.

Tackling Noisy Labels with Network Parameter Additive Decomposition,20/03/2024,"Jingyi Wang, Xiaobo Xia, Long Lan, Xinghao Wu, Jun Yu, Wenjing Yang, Bo Han, Tongliang Liu","Given data with noisy labels, over-parameterized deep networks suffer overfitting mislabeled data, resulting in poor generalization. The memorization effect of deep networks shows that although the networks have the ability to memorize all noisy data, they would first memorize clean training data, and then gradually memorize mislabeled training data. A simple and effective method that exploits the memorization effect to combat noisy labels is early stopping. However, early stopping cannot distinguish the memorization of clean data and mislabeled data, resulting in the network still inevitably overfitting mislabeled data in the early training stage.In this paper, to decouple the memorization of clean data and mislabeled data, and further reduce the side effect of mislabeled data, we perform additive decomposition on network parameters. Namely, all parameters are additively decomposed into two groups, i.e., parameters $\mathbf{w}$ are decomposed as $\mathbf{w}=\bm{\sigma}+\bm{\gamma}$. Afterward, the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are considered to memorize clean data, while the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are considered to memorize mislabeled data. Benefiting from the memorization effect, the updates of the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are encouraged to fully memorize clean data in early training, and then discouraged with the increase of training epochs to reduce interference of mislabeled data. The updates of the parameters $\bm{\gamma}$ are the opposite. In testing, only the parameters $\bm{\sigma}$ are employed to enhance generalization. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world benchmarks confirm the superior performance of our method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13241v2,,N,N,N,N
Safety-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Electric Vehicle Charging Station Management in Distribution Network,20/03/2024,"Jiarong Fan, Ariel Liebman, Hao Wang","The increasing integration of electric vehicles (EVs) into the grid can pose a significant risk to the distribution system operation in the absence of coordination. In response to the need for effective coordination of EVs within the distribution network, this paper presents a safety-aware reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to manage EV charging stations while ensuring the satisfaction of system constraints. Unlike existing methods, our proposed algorithm does not rely on explicit penalties for constraint violations, eliminating the need for penalty coefficient tuning. Furthermore, managing EV charging stations is further complicated by multiple uncertainties, notably the variability in solar energy generation and energy prices. To address this challenge, we develop an off-policy RL algorithm to efficiently utilize data to learn patterns in such uncertain environments. Our algorithm also incorporates a maximum entropy framework to enhance the RL algorithm's exploratory process, preventing convergence to local optimal solutions. Simulation results demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms traditional RL algorithms in managing EV charging in the distribution network.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13236v1,,N,N,N,N

A conditional latent autoregressive recurrent model for generation and forecasting of beam dynamics in particle accelerators,19/03/2024,"Mahindra Rautela, Alan Williams, Alexander Scheinker","Particle accelerators are complex systems that focus, guide, and accelerate intense charged particle beams to high energy. Beam diagnostics present a challenging problem due to limited non-destructive measurements, computationally demanding simulations, and inherent uncertainties in the system. We propose a two-step unsupervised deep learning framework named as Conditional Latent Autoregressive Recurrent Model (CLARM) for learning the spatiotemporal dynamics of charged particles in accelerators. CLARM consists of a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) transforming six-dimensional phase space into a lower-dimensional latent distribution and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network capturing temporal dynamics in an autoregressive manner. The CLARM can generate projections at various accelerator modules by sampling and decoding the latent space representation.

"Most Likely Sequence Generation for $n$-Grams, Transformers, HMMs, and Markov Chains, by Using Rollout Algorithms",19/03/2024,"Yuchao Li, Dimitri Bertsekas","In this paper we consider a transformer with an $n$-gram structure, such as the one underlying ChatGPT. The transformer provides next word probabilities, which can be used to generate word sequences. We consider methods for computing word sequences that are highly likely, based on these probabilities. Computing the optimal (i.e., most likely) word sequence starting with a given initial state is an intractable problem, so we propose methods to compute highly likely sequences of $N$ words in time that is a low order polynomial in $N$ and in the vocabulary size of the $n$-gram. These methods are based on the rollout approach from approximate dynamic programming, a form of single policy iteration, which can improve the performance of any given heuristic policy. In our case we use a greedy heuristic that generates as next word one that has the highest probability. We show with analysis, examples, and computational experimentation that our methods are capable of generating highly likely sequences with a modest increase in computation over the greedy heuristic. While our analysis and experiments are focused on Markov chains of the type arising in transformer and ChatGPT-like models, our methods apply to general finite-state Markov chains, and related inference applications of Hidden Markov Models (HMM), where Viterbi decoding is used extensively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15465v1,,N,N,N,Y
Modal Analysis of Spatiotemporal Data via Multivariate Gaussian Process Regression,19/03/2024,"Jiwoo Song, Daning Huang","Modal analysis has become an essential tool to understand the coherent structure of complex flows. The classical modal analysis methods, such as dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) and spectral proper orthogonal decomposition (SPOD), rely on a sufficient amount of data that is regularly sampled in time. However, often one needs to deal with sparse temporally irregular data, e.g., due to experimental measurements and simulation algorithm. To overcome the limitations of data scarcity and irregular sampling, we propose a novel modal analysis technique using multi-variate Gaussian process regression (MVGPR). We first establish the connection between MVGPR and the existing modal analysis techniques, DMD and SPOD, from a linear system identification perspective. Next, leveraging this connection, we develop a MVGPR-based modal analysis technique that addresses the aforementioned limitations. The capability of MVGPR is endowed by its judiciously designed kernel structure for correlation function, that is derived from the assumed linear dynamics. Subsequently, the proposed MVGPR method is benchmarked against DMD and SPOD on a range of examples, from academic and synthesized data to unsteady airfoil aerodynamics. The results demonstrate MVGPR as a promising alternative to classical modal analysis methods, especially in the scenario of scarce and temporally irregular data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13118v1,,N,N,N,N

SEVEN: Pruning Transformer Model by Reserving Sentinels,19/03/2024,"Jinying Xiao, Ping Li, Jie Nie, Zhe Tang","Large-scale Transformer models (TM) have demonstrated outstanding performance across various tasks. However, their considerable parameter size restricts their applicability, particularly on mobile devices. Due to the dynamic and intricate nature of gradients on TM compared to Convolutional Neural Networks, commonly used pruning methods tend to retain weights with larger gradient noise. This results in pruned models that are sensitive to sparsity and datasets, exhibiting suboptimal performance. Symbolic Descent (SD) is a general approach for training and fine-tuning TM. In this paper, we attempt to describe the noisy batch gradient sequences on TM through the cumulative process of SD. We utilize this design to dynamically assess the importance scores of weights.SEVEN is introduced by us, which particularly favors weights with consistently high sensitivity, i.e., weights with small gradient noise. These weights are tended to be preserved by SEVEN. Extensive experiments on various TM in natural language, question-answering, and image classification domains are conducted to validate the effectiveness of SEVEN. The results demonstrate significant improvements of SEVEN in multiple pruning scenarios and across different sparsity levels.

To validate the model, we generated datasets containing various aluminium configurations for the MOR, MFI, RHO and ITW zeolites along with their heat of adsorptions and Henry coefficients for CO$_2$, obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The predictions obtained from the Machine Learning model are in agreement with the values obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations, confirming that the model can be used for property prediction.

Most existing methods in the literature focus on manually building specific Contrastive Learning Strategies (CLS) by human heuristics for certain datasets and tasks. However, manually developing CLS usually require excessive prior knowledge about the datasets and tasks, e.g., professional cognition of the medical time series in healthcare, as well as huge human labor and massive experiments to determine the detailed learning configurations. In this paper, we present an Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) practice at Microsoft, which automatically learns to contrastively learn representations for various time series datasets and tasks, namely Automated Contrastive Learning (AutoCL). We first construct a principled universal search space of size over 3x1012, covering data augmentation, embedding transformation, contrastive pair construction and contrastive losses. Further, we introduce an efficient reinforcement learning algorithm, which optimizes CLS from the performance on the validation tasks, to obtain more effective CLS within the space. Experimental results on various real-world tasks and datasets demonstrate that AutoCL could automatically find the suitable CLS for a given dataset and task. From the candidate CLS found by AutoCL on several public datasets/tasks, we compose a transferable Generally Good Strategy (GGS), which has a strong performance for other datasets.

Footstep planning is one of those, where the sequence of footsteps is defined. Even in simpler environments, finding a minimal sequence, or even a feasible sequence, yields a complex optimization problem. In the literature, this problem is usually addressed by search-based algorithms (e.g. variants of A*). However, such approaches are either computationally expensive or rely on hand-crafted tuning of several parameters. In this work, at first, we propose an efficient footstep planning method to navigate in local environments with obstacles, based on state-of-the art Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques, with very low computational requirements for on-line inference. Our approach is heuristic-free and relies on a continuous set of actions to generate feasible footsteps. In contrast, other methods necessitate the selection of a relevant discrete set of actions. Second, we propose a forecasting method, allowing to quickly estimate the number of footsteps required to reach different candidates of local targets. This approach relies on inherent computations made by the actor-critic DRL architecture.

In this paper, we analyze the performance of two spectral clustering algorithms for community detection within the multi-layer degree-corrected stochastic block model (MLDCSBM) framework. One algorithm is based on the sum of adjacency matrices, while the other utilizes the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices. We establish consistency results for community detection using these methods under MLDCSBM as the size of the network and/or the number of layers increases. Our theorems demonstrate the advantages of utilizing multiple layers for community detection. Moreover, our analysis indicates that spectral clustering with the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices is generally superior to spectral clustering with the sum of adjacency matrices. Numerical simulations confirm that our algorithm, employing the debiased sum of squared adjacency matrices, surpasses existing methods for community detection in multi-layer networks. Finally, the analysis of several real-world multi-layer networks yields meaningful insights.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12540v1,,N,N,N,N
Generalized Consistency Trajectory Models for Image Manipulation,19/03/2024,"Beomsu Kim, Jaemin Kim, Jeongsol Kim, Jong Chul Ye","Diffusion-based generative models excel in unconditional generation, as well as on applied tasks such as image editing and restoration. The success of diffusion models lies in the iterative nature of diffusion: diffusion breaks down the complex process of mapping noise to data into a sequence of simple denoising tasks. Moreover, we are able to exert fine-grained control over the generation process by injecting guidance terms into each denoising step. However, the iterative process is also computationally intensive, often taking from tens up to thousands of function evaluations. Although consistency trajectory models (CTMs) enable traversal between any time points along the probability flow ODE (PFODE) and score inference with a single function evaluation, CTMs only allow translation from Gaussian noise to data. Thus, this work aims to unlock the full potential of CTMs by proposing generalized CTMs (GCTMs), which translate between arbitrary distributions via ODEs. We discuss the design space of GCTMs and demonstrate their efficacy in various image manipulation tasks such as image-to-image translation, restoration, and editing.

Learning Transferable Time Series Classifier with Cross-Domain Pre-training from Language Model,19/03/2024,"Mingyue Cheng, Xiaoyu Tao, Qi Liu, Hao Zhang, Yiheng Chen, Chenyi Lei","Advancements in self-supervised pre-training (SSL) have significantly advanced the field of learning transferable time series representations, which can be very useful in enhancing the downstream task. Despite being effective, most existing works struggle to achieve cross-domain SSL pre-training, missing valuable opportunities to integrate patterns and features from different domains. The main challenge lies in the significant differences in the characteristics of time-series data across different domains, such as variations in the number of channels and temporal resolution scales. To address this challenge, we propose CrossTimeNet, a novel cross-domain SSL learning framework to learn transferable knowledge from various domains to largely benefit the target downstream task. One of the key characteristics of CrossTimeNet is the newly designed time series tokenization module, which could effectively convert the raw time series into a sequence of discrete tokens based on a reconstruction optimization process. Besides, we highlight that predicting a high proportion of corrupted tokens can be very helpful for extracting informative patterns across different domains during SSL pre-training, which has been largely overlooked in past years. Furthermore, unlike previous works, our work treats the pre-training language model (PLM) as the initialization of the encoder network, investigating the feasibility of transferring the knowledge learned by the PLM to the time series area. Through these efforts, the path to cross-domain pre-training of a generic time series model can be effectively paved. We conduct extensive experiments in a real-world scenario across various time series classification domains. The experimental results clearly confirm CrossTimeNet's superior performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.12372v1,,N,N,N,N
Generative Modelling of Stochastic Rotating Shallow Water Noise,15/03/2024,"Dan Crisan, Oana Lang, Alexander Lobbe","In recent work, the authors have developed a generic methodology for calibrating the noise in fluid dynamics stochastic partial differential equations where the stochasticity was introduced to parametrize subgrid-scale processes. The stochastic parameterization of sub-grid scale processes is required in the estimation of uncertainty in weather and climate predictions, to represent systematic model errors arising from subgrid-scale fluctuations. The previous methodology used a principal component analysis (PCA) technique based on the ansatz that the increments of the stochastic parametrization are normally distributed. In this paper, the PCA technique is replaced by a generative model technique. This enables us to avoid imposing additional constraints on the increments. The methodology is tested on a stochastic rotating shallow water model with the elevation variable of the model used as input data. The numerical simulations show that the noise is indeed non-Gaussian. The generative modelling technology gives good RMSE, CRPS score and forecast rank histogram results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10578v1,,N,N,N,Y
Large Language Models to Generate System-Level Test Programs Targeting Non-functional Properties,15/03/2024,"Denis Schwachhofer, Peter Domanski, Steffen Becker, Stefan Wagner, Matthias Sauer, Dirk Pfl√ºger, Ilia Polian","System-Level Test (SLT) has been a part of the test flow for integrated circuits for over a decade and still gains importance. However, no systematic approaches exist for test program generation, especially targeting non-functional properties of the Device under Test (DUT). Currently, test engineers manually compose test suites from off-the-shelf software, approximating the end-user environment of the DUT. This is a challenging and tedious task that does not guarantee sufficient control over non-functional properties. This paper proposes Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate test programs. We take a first glance at how pre-trained LLMs perform in test program generation to optimize non-functional properties of the DUT. Therefore, we write a prompt to generate C code snippets that maximize the instructions per cycle of a super-scalar, out-of-order architecture in simulation. Additionally, we apply prompt and hyperparameter optimization to achieve the best possible results without further training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.10086v2,,N,N,N,N

Specifically, the Long-Short Term Memory recurrent neural network, which is particularly suited for application over long time series, is employed in the analysis of in-situ measurements of solar wind plasma and magnetic field acquired over more than one solar cycle, from $2005$ to $2019$, at the Lagrangian point L$1$. The problem is approached as a binary classification aiming to predict one hour in advance a decrease in the SYM-H geomagnetic activity index below the threshold of $-50$ nT, which is generally regarded as indicative of magnetospheric perturbations. The strong class imbalance issue is tackled by using an appropriate loss function tailored to optimize appropriate skill scores in the training phase of the neural network. Beside classical skill scores, value-weighted skill scores are then employed to evaluate predictions, suitable in the study of problems, such as the one faced here, characterized by strong temporal variability. For the first time, the content of magnetic helicity and energy carried by solar transients, associated with their detection and likelihood of geo-effectiveness, were considered as input features of the network architecture. Their predictive capabilities are demonstrated through a correlation-driven feature selection method to rank the most relevant characteristics involved in the neural network prediction model. The optimal performance of the adopted neural network in properly forecasting the onset of geomagnetic storms, which is a crucial point for giving real warnings in an operational setting, is finally showed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09847v1,,N,N,N,Y
Adapting OC20-trained EquiformerV2 Models for High-Entropy Materials,14/03/2024,"Christian M. Clausen, Jan Rossmeisl, Zachary W. Ulissi","Computational high-throughput studies, especially in research on high-entropy materials and catalysts, are hampered by high-dimensional composition spaces and myriad structural microstates. They present bottlenecks to the conventional use of density functional theory calculations, and consequently, the use of machine-learned potentials is becoming increasingly prevalent in atomic structure simulations. In this communication, we show the results of adjusting and fine-tuning the pretrained EquiformerV2 model from the Open Catalyst Project to infer adsorption energies of *OH and *O on the out-of-domain high-entropy alloy Ag-Ir-Pd-Pt-Ru. By applying an energy filter based on the local environment of the binding site the zero-shot inference is markedly improved and through few-shot fine-tuning the model yields state-of-the-art accuracy. It is also found that EquiformerV2, assuming the role of general machine learning potential, is able to inform a smaller, more focused direct inference model. This knowledge distillation setup boosts performance on complex binding sites. Collectively, this shows that foundational knowledge learned from ordered intermetallic structures, can be extrapolated to the highly disordered structures of solid-solutions. With the vastly accelerated computational throughput of these models, hitherto infeasible research in the high-entropy material space is now readily accessible.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09811v1,,N,N,N,N
Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series: Contrastive or Generative?,14/03/2024,"Ziyu Liu, Azadeh Alavi, Minyi Li, Xiang Zhang","Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a powerful approach to learning representations from large-scale unlabeled data, showing promising results in time series analysis. The self-supervised representation learning can be categorized into two mainstream: contrastive and generative. In this paper, we will present a comprehensive comparative study between contrastive and generative methods in time series. We first introduce the basic frameworks for contrastive and generative SSL, respectively, and discuss how to obtain the supervision signal that guides the model optimization. We then implement classical algorithms (SimCLR vs. MAE) for each type and conduct a comparative analysis in fair settings. Our results provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and offer practical recommendations for choosing suitable SSL methods.

MG-TSD: Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion Models with Guided Learning Process,09/03/2024,"Xinyao Fan, Yueying Wu, Chang Xu, Yuhao Huang, Weiqing Liu, Jiang Bian","Recently, diffusion probabilistic models have attracted attention in generative time series forecasting due to their remarkable capacity to generate high-fidelity samples. However, the effective utilization of their strong modeling ability in the probabilistic time series forecasting task remains an open question, partially due to the challenge of instability arising from their stochastic nature. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Time Series Diffusion (MG-TSD) model, which achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance by leveraging the inherent granularity levels within the data as given targets at intermediate diffusion steps to guide the learning process of diffusion models. The way to construct the targets is motivated by the observation that the forward process of the diffusion model, which sequentially corrupts the data distribution to a standard normal distribution, intuitively aligns with the process of smoothing fine-grained data into a coarse-grained representation, both of which result in a gradual loss of fine distribution features. In the study, we derive a novel multi-granularity guidance diffusion loss function and propose a concise implementation method to effectively utilize coarse-grained data across various granularity levels. More importantly, our approach does not rely on additional external data, making it versatile and applicable across various domains. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that our MG-TSD model outperforms existing time series prediction methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05751v2,,Y,N,N,Y
Forecasting Electricity Market Signals via Generative AI,09/03/2024,"Xinyi Wang, Qing Zhao, Lang Tong","This paper presents a generative artificial intelligence approach to probabilistic forecasting of electricity market signals, such as real-time locational marginal prices and area control error signals. Inspired by the Wiener-Kallianpur innovation representation of nonparametric time series, we propose a weak innovation autoencoder architecture and a novel deep learning algorithm that extracts the canonical independent and identically distributed innovation sequence of the time series, from which future time series samples are generated. The validity of the proposed approach is established by proving that, under ideal training conditions, the generated samples have the same conditional probability distribution as that of the ground truth. Three applications involving highly dynamic and volatile time series in real-time market operations are considered: (i) locational marginal price forecasting for self-scheduled resources such as battery storage participants, (ii) interregional price spread forecasting for virtual bidders in interchange markets, and (iii) area control error forecasting for frequency regulations. Numerical studies based on market data from multiple independent system operators demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed generative forecaster over leading classical and modern machine learning techniques under both probabilistic and point forecasting metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05743v3,,N,N,N,Y

Synthetic data generation for system identification: leveraging knowledge transfer from similar systems,08/03/2024,"Dario Piga, Matteo Rufolo, Gabriele Maroni, Manas Mejari, Marco Forgione","This paper addresses the challenge of overfitting in the learning of dynamical systems by introducing a novel approach for the generation of synthetic data, aimed at enhancing model generalization and robustness in scenarios characterized by data scarcity. Central to the proposed methodology is the concept of knowledge transfer from systems within the same class. Specifically, synthetic data is generated through a pre-trained meta-model that describes a broad class of systems to which the system of interest is assumed to belong. Training data serves a dual purpose: firstly, as input to the pre-trained meta model to discern the system's dynamics, enabling the prediction of its behavior and thereby generating synthetic output sequences for new input sequences; secondly, in conjunction with synthetic data, to define the loss function used for model estimation. A validation dataset is used to tune a scalar hyper-parameter balancing the relative importance of training and synthetic data in the definition of the loss function. The same validation set can be also used for other purposes, such as early stopping during the training, fundamental to avoid overfitting in case of small-size training datasets. The efficacy of the approach is shown through a numerical example that highlights the advantages of integrating synthetic data into the system identification process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.05164v1,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Feature Selection as Deep Sequential Generative Learning,06/03/2024,"Wangyang Ying, Dongjie Wang, Haifeng Chen, Yanjie Fu","Feature selection aims to identify the most pattern-discriminative feature subset. In prior literature, filter (e.g., backward elimination) and embedded (e.g., Lasso) methods have hyperparameters (e.g., top-K, score thresholding) and tie to specific models, thus, hard to generalize; wrapper methods search a feature subset in a huge discrete space and is computationally costly. To transform the way of feature selection, we regard a selected feature subset as a selection decision token sequence and reformulate feature selection as a deep sequential generative learning task that distills feature knowledge and generates decision sequences. Our method includes three steps: (1) We develop a deep variational transformer model over a joint of sequential reconstruction, variational, and performance evaluator losses. Our model can distill feature selection knowledge and learn a continuous embedding space to map feature selection decision sequences into embedding vectors associated with utility scores. (2) We leverage the trained feature subset utility evaluator as a gradient provider to guide the identification of the optimal feature subset embedding;(3) We decode the optimal feature subset embedding to autoregressively generate the best feature selection decision sequence with autostop. Extensive experimental results show this generative perspective is effective and generic, without large discrete search space and expert-specific hyperparameters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03838v1,,N,N,N,Y

Tung, Zhiyong Huang","Time Series Generation (TSG) has emerged as a pivotal technique in synthesizing data that accurately mirrors real-world time series, becoming indispensable in numerous applications. Despite significant advancements in TSG, its efficacy frequently hinges on having large training datasets. This dependency presents a substantial challenge in data-scarce scenarios, especially when dealing with rare or unique conditions. To confront these challenges, we explore a new problem of Controllable Time Series Generation (CTSG), aiming to produce synthetic time series that can adapt to various external conditions, thereby tackling the data scarcity issue. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontrollable \textbf{T}ime \textbf{S}eries (\textsf{CTS}), an innovative VAE-agnostic framework tailored for CTSG. A key feature of \textsf{CTS} is that it decouples the mapping process from standard VAE training, enabling precise learning of a complex interplay between latent features and external conditions. Moreover, we develop a comprehensive evaluation scheme for CTSG. Extensive experiments across three real-world time series datasets showcase \textsf{CTS}'s exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality, controllable outputs. This underscores its adeptness in seamlessly integrating latent features with external conditions. Extending \textsf{CTS} to the image domain highlights its remarkable potential for explainability and further reinforces its versatility across different modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.03698v1,,Y,Y,Y,Y

Time Weaver: A Conditional Time Series Generation Model,05/03/2024,"Sai Shankar Narasimhan, Shubhankar Agarwal, Oguzhan Akcin, Sujay Sanghavi, Sandeep Chinchali","Imagine generating a city's electricity demand pattern based on weather, the presence of an electric vehicle, and location, which could be used for capacity planning during a winter freeze. Such real-world time series are often enriched with paired heterogeneous contextual metadata (weather, location, etc.). Current approaches to time series generation often ignore this paired metadata, and its heterogeneity poses several practical challenges in adapting existing conditional generation approaches from the image, audio, and video domains to the time series domain. To address this gap, we introduce Time Weaver, a novel diffusion-based model that leverages the heterogeneous metadata in the form of categorical, continuous, and even time-variant variables to significantly improve time series generation. Additionally, we show that naive extensions of standard evaluation metrics from the image to the time series domain are insufficient. These metrics do not penalize conditional generation approaches for their poor specificity in reproducing the metadata-specific features in the generated time series. Thus, we innovate a novel evaluation metric that accurately captures the specificity of conditional generation and the realism of the generated time series. We show that Time Weaver outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), by up to 27% in downstream classification tasks on real-world energy, medical, air quality, and traffic data sets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.02682v1,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Diffusion-TS: Interpretable Diffusion for General Time Series Generation,04/03/2024,"Xinyu Yuan, Yan Qiao","Denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) are becoming the leading paradigm for generative models. It has recently shown breakthroughs in audio synthesis, time series imputation and forecasting. In this paper, we propose Diffusion-TS, a novel diffusion-based framework that generates multivariate time series samples of high quality by using an encoder-decoder transformer with disentangled temporal representations, in which the decomposition technique guides Diffusion-TS to capture the semantic meaning of time series while transformers mine detailed sequential information from the noisy model input. Different from existing diffusion-based approaches, we train the model to directly reconstruct the sample instead of the noise in each diffusion step, combining a Fourier-based loss term. Diffusion-TS is expected to generate time series satisfying both interpretablity and realness. In addition, it is shown that the proposed Diffusion-TS can be easily extended to conditional generation tasks, such as forecasting and imputation, without any model changes. This also motivates us to further explore the performance of Diffusion-TS under irregular settings. Finally, through qualitative and quantitative experiments, results show that Diffusion-TS achieves the state-of-the-art results on various realistic analyses of time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01742v2,,Y,Y,Y,Y

"StiefelGen: A Simple, Model Agnostic Approach for Time Series Data Augmentation over Riemannian Manifolds",29/02/2024,"Prasad Cheema, Mahito Sugiyama","Data augmentation is an area of research which has seen active development in many machine learning fields, such as in image-based learning models, reinforcement learning for self driving vehicles, and general noise injection for point cloud data. However, convincing methods for general time series data augmentation still leaves much to be desired, especially since the methods developed for these models do not readily cross-over. Three common approaches for time series data augmentation include: (i) Constructing a physics-based model and then imbuing uncertainty over the coefficient space (for example), (ii) Adding noise to the observed data set(s), and, (iii) Having access to ample amounts of time series data sets from which a robust generative neural network model can be trained. However, for many practical problems that work with time series data in the industry: (i) One usually does not have access to a robust physical model, (ii) The addition of noise can in of itself require large or difficult assumptions (for example, what probability distribution should be used? Or, how large should the noise variance be?), and, (iii) In practice, it can be difficult to source a large representative time series data base with which to train the neural network model for the underlying problem. In this paper, we propose a methodology which attempts to simultaneously tackle all three of these previous limitations to a large extent. The method relies upon the well-studied matrix differential geometry of the Stiefel manifold, as it proposes a simple way in which time series signals can placed on, and then smoothly perturbed over the manifold. We attempt to clarify how this method works by showcasing several potential use cases which in particular work to take advantage of the unique properties of this underlying manifold.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.19287v1,,Y,N,N,Y

Existing model families, like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), autoregressive models, and diffusion models, generally excel in specific capabilities and data types but fall short in others. We introduce generalized diffusion with learnable encoder-decoder (DiLED), that seamlessly integrates the core capabilities for broad applicability and enhanced performance. DiLED generalizes the Gaussian noising-denoising in standard diffusion by introducing parameterized encoding-decoding. Crucially, DiLED is compatible with the well-established diffusion model objective and training recipes, allowing effective learning of the encoder-decoder parameters jointly with diffusion. By choosing appropriate encoder/decoder (e.g., large language models), DiLED naturally applies to different data types.

In turn, Bayesian diffusion models, that map this low-dimensional manifold onto its corresponding high-dimensional space, capture the statistics of the system dynamics. We demonstrate the capabilities and drawbacks of G-LED in simulations of several benchmark systems, including the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation, two-dimensional high Reynolds number flow over a backward-facing step, and simulations of three-dimensional turbulent channel flow.

Generative models already demonstrated their capabilities for reliable protein design. However, previous models are limited to the unconditional generation of protein sequences and lack the controllable generation ability that is vital to biological tasks. In this work, we propose TaxDiff, a taxonomic-guided diffusion model for controllable protein sequence generation that combines biological species information with the generative capabilities of diffusion models to generate structurally stable proteins within the sequence space. Specifically, taxonomic control information is inserted into each layer of the transformer block to achieve fine-grained control. The combination of global and local attention ensures the sequence consistency and structural foldability of taxonomic-specific proteins. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TaxDiff can consistently achieve better performance on multiple protein sequence generation benchmarks in both taxonomic-guided controllable generation and unconditional generation. Remarkably, the sequences generated by TaxDiff even surpass those produced by direct-structure-generation models in terms of confidence based on predicted structures and require only a quarter of the time of models based on the diffusion model.

Time series generation for option pricing on quantum computers using tensor network,27/02/2024,"Nozomu Kobayashi, Yoshiyuki Suimon, Koichi Miyamoto","Finance, especially option pricing, is a promising industrial field that might benefit from quantum computing. While quantum algorithms for option pricing have been proposed, it is desired to devise more efficient implementations of costly operations in the algorithms, one of which is preparing a quantum state that encodes a probability distribution of the underlying asset price. In particular, in pricing a path-dependent option, we need to generate a state encoding a joint distribution of the underlying asset price at multiple time points, which is more demanding. To address these issues, we propose a novel approach using Matrix Product State (MPS) as a generative model for time series generation.

On the downside, training requires telling apart real data from artificially-generated ones using adversarial discriminators, leading to unstable training and mode-dropping issues. As reported by Zahee et al. (2017), even in the one-dimensional (1D) case, training a generative adversarial network (GAN) is challenging and often suboptimal. In this work, we develop a discriminator-free method for training one-dimensional (1D) generative implicit models and subsequently expand this method to accommodate multivariate cases. Our loss function is a discrepancy measure between a suitably chosen transformation of the model samples and a uniform distribution; hence, it is invariant with respect to the true distribution of the data. We first formulate our method for 1D random variables, providing an effective solution for approximate reparameterization of arbitrary complex distributions. Then, we consider the temporal setting (both univariate and multivariate), in which we model the conditional distribution of each sample given the history of the process.

Soft-DTW is used as a differentiable alternative for the reconstruction loss and is found to be superior to Euclidean distance. Combining reconstruction loss and the latent space's prior probability distribution serves as the anomaly score.

We show that the weak innovation sequence is Bayesian sufficient, which makes the proposed weak innovation autoencoder a canonical architecture for generative probabilistic forecasting. The proposed technique is applied to forecasting highly volatile real-time electricity prices, demonstrating superior performance across multiple forecasting measures over leading probabilistic and point forecasting techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13870v1,,N,N,Y,Y
Protect and Extend -- Using GANs for Synthetic Data Generation of Time-Series Medical Records,21/02/2024,"Navid Ashrafi, Vera Schmitt, Robert P. Spang, Sebastian M√∂ller, Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons","Preservation of private user data is of paramount importance for high Quality of Experience (QoE) and acceptability, particularly with services treating sensitive data, such as IT-based health services. Whereas anonymization techniques were shown to be prone to data re-identification, synthetic data generation has gradually replaced anonymization since it is relatively less time and resource-consuming and more robust to data leakage. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been used for generating synthetic datasets, especially GAN frameworks adhering to the differential privacy phenomena. This research compares state-of-the-art GAN-based models for synthetic data generation to generate time-series synthetic medical records of dementia patients which can be distributed without privacy concerns. Predictive modeling, autocorrelation, and distribution analysis are used to assess the Quality of Generating (QoG) of the generated data. The privacy preservation of the respective models is assessed by applying membership inference attacks to determine potential data leakage risks. Our experiments indicate the superiority of the privacy-preserving GAN (PPGAN) model over other models regarding privacy preservation while maintaining an acceptable level of QoG. The presented results can support better data protection for medical use cases in the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.14042v2,,Y,Y,Y,Y
DiffPLF: A Conditional Diffusion Model for Probabilistic Forecasting of EV Charging Load,21/02/2024,"Siyang Li, Hui Xiong, Yize Chen","Due to the vast electric vehicle (EV) penetration to distribution grid, charging load forecasting is essential to promote charging station operation and demand-side management.However, the stochastic charging behaviors and associated exogenous factors render future charging load patterns quite volatile and hard to predict. Accordingly, we devise a novel Diffusion model termed DiffPLF for Probabilistic Load Forecasting of EV charging, which can explicitly approximate the predictive load distribution conditioned on historical data and related covariates. Specifically, we leverage a denoising diffusion model, which can progressively convert the Gaussian prior to real time-series data by learning a reversal of the diffusion process. Besides, we couple such diffusion model with a cross-attention-based conditioning mechanism to execute conditional generation for possible charging demand profiles. We also propose a task-informed fine-tuning technique to better adapt DiffPLF to the probabilistic time-series forecasting task and acquire more accurate and reliable predicted intervals. Finally, we conduct multiple experiments to validate the superiority of DiffPLF to predict complex temporal patterns of erratic charging load and carry out controllable generation based on certain covariate. Results demonstrate that we can attain a notable rise of 39.58% and 49.87% on MAE and CRPS respectively compared to the conventional method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13548v1,,N,N,N,Y
Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks as Generative Models - Reconstructing Gaps in Time Series,02/11/2015,"Mathias Berglund, Tapani Raiko, Mikko Honkala, Leo K√§rkk√§inen, Akos Vetek, Juha Karhunen","Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (RNN) are trained to predict both in the positive and negative time directions simultaneously. They have not been used commonly in unsupervised tasks, because a probabilistic interpretation of the model has been difficult. Recently, two different frameworks, GSN and NADE, provide a connection between reconstruction and probabilistic modeling, which makes the interpretation possible. As far as we know, neither GSN or NADE have been studied in the context of time series before. As an example of an unsupervised task, we study the problem of filling in gaps in high-dimensional time series with complex dynamics. Although unidirectional RNNs have recently been trained successfully to model such time series, inference in the negative time direction is non-trivial. We propose two probabilistic interpretations of bidirectional RNNs that can be used to reconstruct missing gaps efficiently. Our experiments on text data show that both proposed methods are much more accurate than unidirectional reconstructions, although a bit less accurate than a computationally complex bidirectional Bayesian inference on the unidirectional RNN. We also provide results on music data for which the Bayesian inference is computationally infeasible, demonstrating the scalability of the proposed methods.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1504.01575,,Y,Y,Y,Y

RGANs make use of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in the generator and the discriminator. In the case of RCGANs, both of these RNNs are conditioned on auxiliary information. We demonstrate our models in a set of toy datasets, where we show visually and quantitatively (using sample likelihood and maximum mean discrepancy) that they can successfully generate realistic time-series. We also describe novel evaluation methods for GANs, where we generate a synthetic labelled training dataset, and evaluate on a real test set the performance of a model trained on the synthetic data, and vice-versa. We illustrate with these metrics that RCGANs can generate time-series data useful for supervised training, with only minor degradation in performance on real test data. This is demonstrated on digit classification from ‚Äòserialised‚Äô MNIST and by training an early warning system on a medical dataset of 17,000 patients from an intensive care unit.

Hierarchical Deep Generative Models For Multi-Rate Multivariate Time Series,10/07/2018,"Zhengping Che, Sanjay Purushotham, Guangyu Li, Bo Jiang, Yan Liu","Multi-Rate Multivariate Time Series (MR-MTS) are the multivariate time series observations which come with various sampling rates and encode multiple temporal dependencies. State-space models such as Kalman filters and deep learning models such as deep Markov models are mainly designed for time series data with the same sampling rate and cannot capture all the dependencies present in the MR-MTS data. To address this challenge, we propose the Multi-Rate Hierarchical Deep Markov Model (MR-HDMM), a novel deep generative model which uses the latent hierarchical structure with a learnable switch mechanism to capture the temporal dependencies of MR-MTS.

Our approach is based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGAN), where the generative step is implemented by a deconvolutional NN and the discriminative step by a convolutional NN. Both the generator and the discriminator are conditioned on the sampling timestamps, to learn the hidden relationship between data and timestamps, and consequently to generate new time series. We evaluate our model with synthetic and real-world datasets. For the synthetic data, we compare the performance of a classifier trained with T-CGAN-generated data, against the performance of the same classifier trained on the original data. Results show that classifiers trained on T-CGAN-generated data perform the same as classifiers trained on real data, even with very short time series and small training sets. For the real world datasets, we compare our method with other techniques of data augmentation for time series, such as time slicing and time warping, over a classification problem with unbalanced datasets. Results show that our method always outperforms the other approaches, both in case of regularly sampled and irregularly sampled time series.

However, we prove in this work that the performance of these models is limited on datasets with high-variability for example containing different classes. In such setups, it is extremely difficult for a generative model to find the right trade-off between sample fidelity i.e. their similarity to the real time series and sample diversity. Furthermore, it is essential to preserve the original classes and the variation within each class. To tackle this issue, we propose a new generative class sensitive model, Class-specific Recurrent GAN (CLaReGAN), that conditions the generator on an auxiliary information containing the class-specific and class-independent attributes. Our model relies on class specific encoders: a unique encoder for two contradictory functionalities i.e. extracting the inter- and intra-class attributes. To extract the high-level representation of the time series, we make a shared-latent space assumption [19]. At the same time, we use a class discriminator that discriminates between the latent vectors to efficiently extract the class-specific attributes. We test our approach on a set of publicly available datasets where the number of classes, the length and the number of available times series for each class varies and evaluate our approach both visually and computationally.

Conditional Loss And Deep Euler Scheme For Time Series Generation,06/10/2021,"Carl Remlinger, Joseph Mikael, Romuald Elie","We introduce three new generative models for time series that are based on Euler discretization of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and Wasserstein metrics. Two of these methods rely on the adaptation of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to time series. The third algorithm, called Conditional Euler Generator (CEGEN), minimizes a dedicated distance between the transition probability distributions over all time steps. In the context of It√¥ processes, we provide theoretical guarantees that minimizing this criterion implies accurate estimations of the drift and volatility parameters. We demonstrate empirically that CEGEN outperforms state-of-the-art and GAN generators on both marginal and temporal dynamics metrics. Besides, it identifies accurate correlation structures in high dimension. When few data points are available, we verify the effectiveness of CEGEN, when combined with transfer learning methods on Monte Carlo simulations.

Towards Generating Real-World Time Series Data,16/11/2021,"Hengzhi Pei, Kan Ren, Yuqing Yang, Chang Liu, Tao Qin, Dongsheng Li","Time series data generation has drawn increasing attention in recent years. Several generative adversarial network (GAN) based methods have been proposed to tackle the problem usually with the assumption that the targeted time series data are well-formatted and complete. However, real-world time series (RTS) data are far away from this utopia, e.g., long sequences with variable lengths and informative missing data raise intractable challenges for designing powerful generation algorithms. In this paper, we propose a novel generative framework for RTS data ‚Äî RTSGAN to tackle the aforementioned challenges. RTSGAN first learns an encoder-decoder module which provides a mapping between a time series instance and a fixeddimension latent vector and then learns a generation module to generate vectors in the same latent space. By combining the generator and the decoder, RTSGAN is able to generate RTS which respect the original feature distributions and the temporal dynamics. To generate time series with missing values, we further equip RTSGAN with an observation embedding layer and a decide-and-generate decoder to better utilize the informative missing patterns. Experiments on the four RTS datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the previous generation methods in terms of synthetic data utility for downstream classification and prediction tasks.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2111.08386,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Time-Series Generation By Contrastive Imitation,06/12/2021,"Daniel Jarrett, Ioana Bica, Mihaela van der Schaar","Consider learning a generative model for time-series data.

We propose a novel architecture for synthetically generating time-series data with the use of Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs). The proposed architecture has several distinct properties: interpretability, ability to encode domain knowledge, and reduced training times. We evaluate data generation quality by similarity and predictability against four multivariate datasets. We experiment with varying sizes of training data to measure the impact of data availability on generation quality for our VAE method as well as several state-of-the-art data generation methods. Our results on similarity tests show that the VAE approach is able to accurately represent the temporal attributes of the original data. On next-step prediction tasks using generated data, the proposed VAE architecture consistently meets or exceeds performance of state-ofthe-art data generation methods. While noise reduction may cause the generated data to deviate from original data, we demonstrate the resulting de-noised data can significantly improve performance for next-step prediction using generated data. Finally, the proposed architecture can incorporate domain-specific time-patterns such as polynomial trends and seasonalities to provide interpretable outputs. Such interpretability can be highly advantageous in applications requiring transparency of model outputs or where users desire to inject prior knowledge of time-series patterns into the generative model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08095.pdf,,Y,Y,Y,Y

Time Series Generation With Masked Autoencoder,19/05/2022,"Mengyue Zha, SiuTim Wong, Mengqi Liu, Tong Zhang, Kani Chen","This paper shows that masked autoencoder with extrapolator (ExtraMAE) is a scalable self-supervised model for time series generation. ExtraMAE randomly masks some patches of the original time series and learns temporal dynamics by recovering the masked patches. Our approach has two core designs. First, ExtraMAE is self-supervised. Supervision allows ExtraMAE to effectively and efficiently capture the temporal dynamics of the original time series. Second, ExtraMAE proposes an extrapolator to disentangle two jobs of the decoder: recovering latent representations and mapping them back into the feature space. These unique designs enable ExtraMAE to consistently and significantly outperform state-of-the-art (SoTA) benchmarks in time series generation. The lightweight architecture also makes ExtraMAE fast and scalable. ExtraMAE shows outstanding behavior in various downstream tasks such as time series classification, prediction, and imputation. As a self-supervised generative model, ExtraMAE allows explicit management of the synthetic data.

Knottenbelt","Many real-world tasks are plagued by limitations on data: in some instances very little data is available and in others, data is protected by privacy enforcing regulations (e.g. GDPR). We consider limitations posed specifically on time-series data and present a model that can generate synthetic time-series which can be used in place of real data. A model that generates synthetic time-series data has two objectives: 1) to capture the stepwise conditional distribution of real sequences, and 2) to faithfully model the joint distribution of entire real sequences. Autoregressive models trained via maximum likelihood estimation can be used in a system where previous predictions are fed back in and used to predict future ones; in such models, errors can accrue over time. Furthermore, a plausible initial value is required making MLE based models not really generative. Many downstream tasks learn to model conditional distributions of the time-series, hence, synthetic data drawn from a generative model must satisfy 1) in addition to performing 2).

For time-series, the suite of data augmentation tricks we can use to expand the size of the dataset is limited by the need to maintain the basic properties of the signal. Data generated by a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) can be utilized as another data augmentation tool. RNN-based GANs suffer from the fact that they cannot effectively model long sequences of data points with irregular temporal relations. To tackle these problems, we introduce TTS-GAN, a transformer-based GAN which can successfully generate realistic synthetic time-series data sequences of arbitrary length, similar to the real ones. Both the generator and discriminator networks of the GAN model are built using a pure transformer encoder architecture.

Wasserstein generative adversarial networks for modeling marked events,01/08/2022,"S. Haleh S.

Point processes and their non-functional variations using recurrent neural networks (RNN) model temporal events using intensity functions. However, since they usually utilize the likelihood maximization approach, they might fail. Moreover, their high simulation complexity makes them inappropriate. Since calculating the intensity function is not always necessary, generative models are utilized for modeling. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have been successful in modeling point processes, but they still lack in modeling interdependent types and times of events. In this research, a double Wasserstein GAN (WGAN), using a conditional GAN, is proposed which generates types of events that are categorical data, dependent on their times.

Machine-Learning-empowered monitoring offers the opportunity to anticipate costly failures early and hence reduce development time. However, machine learning (ML) for process monitoring requires large amounts of training data, especially as the targeted fault states are scarce and yet diverse in their appearances.Therefore, we propose to use synthetic time series data to leverage the high cost of acquiring training data from experiments in real test benches. In this article, we present a novel scheme to generate synthetic data based on a sub-dimensional time series representation. We introduce a highly flexible model by mapping the data to a latent representation and approximating the latent data distribution by a Gaussian Mixture Model. In addition, we propose the Fr√©chet InceptionTime Distance (FITD) as a new distance measure to evaluate the generated data. It allows extracting characteristics at different scales by using multiple kernel sizes. In this way, we ensure that the synthesized data contains characteristics similar to those present in the real data. In our experiment, we train two types of fault detectors, one based on real data of a motor test bench and the other based on synthetic data. We also consider employing fault-aware conditional architectures to generate training data for different fault types explicitly.

These equations can be hard to solve numerically. We provide an approximation algorithm using conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs) in combination with signatures, an object from rough path theory. The signature of a sufficiently smooth path determines the path completely. As a result, in some cases, GANs based on signatures have been shown to efficiently approximate the law of a stochastic process.

A common type of multivariate time series originates from a single source such as the biometric measurements from a medical patient. This leads to complex dynamical patterns between individual time series that are hard to learn by typical generation models such as GANs. There is valuable information in those patterns that machine learning models can use to better classify, predict or perform other downstream tasks. We propose a novel framework that takes time series' common origin into account and favors channel/feature relationships preservation. The two key points of our method are: 1) the individual time series are generated from a common point in latent space and 2) a central discriminator favors the preservation of inter-channel/feature dynamics. We demonstrate empirically that our method helps preserve channel/feature correlations and that our synthetic data performs very well in downstream tasks with medical and financial data.

In this study we use a time-series generative adversarial network (TimeGAN) to synthesize multivariate agricultural sensing data and train RNN (Recurrent Neural Network), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) neural network prediction models on the original and generated data to predict future pest populations. After our experiment, the data generated using TimeGAN and the original data have the smallest EC value in the GRU model, which is 9.86. The results show that the generative model effectively synthesizes multivariate agricultural sensing data and can be used to make up for the lack of actual data.

Non-adversarial training of Neural SDEs with signature kernel scores,01/05/2023,"Zacharia Issa, Blanka Horvath, Maud Lemercier, Cristopher Salvi","Neural SDEs are continuous-time generative models for sequential data. Stateof-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16274,,Y,Y,Y,Y

Towards this goal, a key step is the development of an effective discriminator to distinguish between time series distributions. We propose the so-called PCF-GAN, a novel GAN that incorporates the path characteristic function (PCF) as the principled representation of time series distribution into the discriminator to enhance its generative performance. On the one hand, we establish theoretical foundations of the PCF distance by proving its characteristicity, boundedness, differentiability with respect to generator parameters, and weak continuity, which ensure the stability and feasibility of training the PCF-GAN. On the other hand, we design efficient initialisation and optimisation schemes for PCFs to strengthen the discriminative power and accelerate training efficiency. To further boost the capabilities of complex time series generation, we integrate the auto-encoder structure via sequential embedding into the PCF-GAN, which provides additional reconstruction functionality.

Fully Embedded Time-Series Generative Adversarial Networks,30/08/2023,"Joe Beck, Subhadeep Chakraborty","Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) should produce synthetic data that fits the underlying distribution of the data being modeled. For real valued time-series data, this implies the need to simultaneously capture the static distribution of the data, but also the full temporal distribution of the data for any potential time horizon. This temporal element produces a more complex problem that can potentially leave current solutions under-constrained, unstable during training, or prone to varying degrees of mode collapse. In FETSGAN, entire sequences are translated directly to the generator‚Äôs sampling space using a seq2seq style adversarial autoencoder (AAE), where adversarial training is used to match the training distribution in both the feature space and the lower dimensional sampling space. This additional constraint provides a loose assurance that the temporal distribution of the synthetic samples will not collapse. In addition, the First Above Threshold (FAT) operator is introduced to supplement the reconstruction of encoded sequences, which improves training stability and the overall quality of the synthetic data being generated. These novel contributions demonstrate a significant improvement to the current state of the art for adversarial learners in qualitative measures of temporal similarity and quantitative predictive ability of data generated through FETSGAN.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2308.15730,,Y,Y,Y,Y

However, these methods struggle to capture the temporal dependence of joint probability distributions induced by time-series data. Furthermore, long time-series data streams hugely increase the dimension of the target space, which may render generative modelling infeasible. To overcome these challenges, motivated by the autoregressive models in econometric, we are interested in the conditional distribution of future time series given the past information. We propose the generic conditional Sig-WGAN framework by integrating Wasserstein-GANs (WGANs) with mathematically principled and efficient path feature extraction called the signature of a path. The signature of a path is a graded sequence of statistics that provides a universal description for a stream of data, and its expected value characterises the law of the time-series model. In particular, we develop the conditional Sig-W1 metric, that captures the conditional joint law of time series models, and use it as a discriminator. The signature feature space enables the explicit representation of the proposed discriminators which alleviates the need for expensive training.

Experiments on various synthetic and real-world data substantiate the superiority of the proposed point process model over conventional ones. ",https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1705.08051,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Fractional SDE-Net: Generation of Time Series Data with Long-term Memory,24/08/2022,"Kohei Hayashi, Kei Nakagawa","In this paper, we focus on the generation of time-series data using neural networks. It is often the case that input time-series data have only one realized (and usually irregularly sampled) path, which makes it difficult to extract time-series characteristics, and its noise structure is more complicated than i.i.d. type. Time series data, especially from hydrology, telecommunications, economics, and finance, exhibit long-term memory also called long-range dependency (LRD). The main purpose of this paper is to artificially generate time series with the help of neural networks, making the LRD of paths into account. We propose fSDE-Net: neural fractional Stochastic Differential Equation Network. It generalizes the neural stochastic differential equation model by using fractional Brownian motion with a Hurst index larger than half, which exhibits the LRD property. We derive the solver of fSDE-Net and theoretically analyze the existence and uniqueness of the solution to fSDE-Net. Our experiments with artificial and real time-series data demonstrate that the fSDE-Net model can replicate distributional properties well.",https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2201.05974,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Towards Realistic Market Simulations: a Generative Adversarial Networks Approach,25/10/2021,"Andrea Coletta, Matteo Prata, Michele Conti, Emanuele Mercanti, Novella Bartolini, Aymeric Moulin, Svitlana Vyetrenko, Tucker Balch","Simulated environments are increasingly used by trading firms and investment banks to evaluate trading strategies before approaching real markets. Backtesting, a widely used approach, consists of simulating experimental strategies while replaying historical market scenarios. Unfortunately, this approach does not capture the market response to the experimental agents' actions. In contrast, multi-agent simulation presents a natural bottom-up approach to emulating agent interaction in financial markets. It allows to set up pools of traders with diverse strategies to mimic the financial market trader population, and test the performance of new experimental strategies. Since individual agent-level historical data is typically proprietary and not available for public use, it is difficult to calibrate multiple market agents to obtain the realism required for testing trading strategies. To addresses this challenge we propose a synthetic market generator based on Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs) trained on real aggregate-level historical data. A CGAN-based ""world"" agent can generate meaningful orders in response to an experimental agent. We integrate our synthetic market generator into ABIDES, an open source simulator of financial markets. By means of extensive simulations we show that our proposal outperforms previous work in terms of stylized facts reflecting market responsiveness and realism.

Learning to simulate realistic limit order book markets from data as a World Agent,26/09/2022,"Andrea Coletta, Svitlana Vyetrenko, Aymeric Moulin, Tucker Balch","Multi-agent market simulators usually require careful calibration to emulate real markets, which includes the number and the type of agents. Poorly calibrated simulators can lead to misleading conclusions, potentially causing severe loss when employed by investment banks, hedge funds, and traders to study and evaluate trading strategies. In this paper, we propose a world model simulator that accurately emulates a limit order book market -- it requires no agent calibration but rather learns the simulated market behavior directly from historical data. Traditional approaches fail short to learn and calibrate trader population, as historical labeled data with details on each individual trader strategy is not publicly available. Our approach proposes to learn a unique ""world"" agent from historical data. It is intended to emulate the overall trader population, without the need of making assumptions about individual market agent strategies. We implement our world agent simulator models as a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN), as well as a mixture of parametric distributions, and we compare our models against previous work. Qualitatively and quantitatively, we show that the proposed approaches consistently outperform previous work, providing more realism and responsiveness. ",,,Y,Y,Y,N
"Conditional Generators for Limit Order Book Environments: Explainability, Challenges, and Robustness", and Robustness, Challenges,"Limit order books are a fundamental and widespread market mechanism. This paper investigates the use of conditional generative models for order book simulation. For developing a trading agent, this approach has drawn recent attention as an alternative to traditional backtesting due to its ability to react to the presence of the trading agent. Using a state-of-the-art CGAN (from Coletta et al. (2022)), we explore its dependence upon input features, which highlights both strengths and weaknesses. To do this, we use ""adversarial attacks"" on the model's features and its mechanism. We then show how these insights can be used to improve the CGAN, both in terms of its realism and robustness. We finish by laying out a roadmap for future work. ",,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Generating Realistic Stock Market Order Streams,07/06/2020,"Junyi Li, Xitong Wang, Yaoyang Lin, Arunesh Sinha, Micheal P. Wellman","We propose an approach to generate realistic and high-fidelity stock market data based on generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our Stock-GAN model employs a conditional Wasserstein GAN to capture history dependence of orders. The generator design includes specially crafted aspects including components that approximate the market's auction mechanism, augmenting the order history with order-book constructions to improve the generation task. We perform an ablation study to verify the usefulness of aspects of our network structure. We provide a mathematical characterization of distribution learned by the generator. We also propose statistics to measure the quality of generated orders. We test our approach with synthetic and actual market data, compare to many baseline generative models, and find the generated data to be close to real data.",,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Generative AI for End-to-End Limit Order Book Modelling: A Token-Level Autoregressive Generative Model of Message Flow Using a Deep State Space Network,23/08/2023,"Peer Nagy, Kang Li, Sascha Frey, Anisoara Calinescu, Jakob Foerster, Silvia Sapora, Stefan Zohren","Developing a generative model of realistic order flow in financial markets is a challenging open problem, with numerous applications for market participants. Addressing this, we propose the first end-to-end autoregressive generative model that generates tokenized limit order book (LOB) messages. These messages are interpreted by a Jax-LOB simulator, which updates the LOB state. To handle long sequences efficiently, the model employs simplified structured state-space layers to process sequences of order book states and tokenized messages. Using LOBSTER data of NASDAQ equity LOBs, we develop a custom tokenizer for message data, converting groups of successive digits to tokens, similar to tokenization in large language models. Out-of-sample results show promising performance in approximating the data distribution, as evidenced by low model perplexity. Furthermore, the mid-price returns calculated from the generated order flow exhibit a significant correlation with the data, indicating impressive conditional forecast performance. Due to the granularity of generated data, and the accuracy of the model, it offers new application areas for future work beyond forecasting, e.g. acting as a world model in high-frequency financial reinforcement learning applications. Overall, our results invite the use and extension of the model in the direction of autoregressive large financial models for the generation of high-frequency financial data and we commit to open-sourcing our code to facilitate future research.

Fin-GAN: Forecasting and Classifying Financial Time Series via Generative Adversarial Networks,19/01/2023,"Milena Vuletic, Mihai Cucuringu, Felix Prenzel","We investigate the use of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for probabilistic forecasting of financial time series. To this end, we introduce a novel economics-driven loss function for the generator. This newly designed loss function renders GANs more suitable for a classification task, and places them into a supervised learning setting, whilst producing full conditional probability distributions of price returns given previous historical values. Our approach moves beyond the point estimates traditionally employed in the forecasting literature, and allows for uncertainty estimates. Numerical experiments on equity data showcase the effectiveness of our proposed methodology, which achieves higher Sharpe Ratios compared to classical supervised learning models, such as LSTMs and ARIMA.",,,Y,N,N,Y
Market-GAN: Adding Control to Financial Market Data Generation with Semantic Context,14/09/2023,"Haochong Xia, Shuo Sun, Xinrun Wang, Bo An","Financial simulators play an important role in enhancing forecasting accuracy, managing risks, and fostering strategic financial decision-making. Despite the development of financial market simulation methodologies, existing frameworks often struggle with adapting to specialized simulation context. We pinpoint the challenges as i) current financial datasets do not contain context labels; ii) current techniques are not designed to generate financial data with context as control, which demands greater precision compared to other modalities; iii) the inherent difficulties in generating context-aligned, high-fidelity data given the non-stationary, noisy nature of financial data. To address these challenges, our contributions are: i) we proposed the Contextual Market Dataset with market dynamics, stock ticker, and history state as context, leveraging a market dynamics modeling method that combines linear regression and Dynamic Time Warping clustering to extract market dynamics; ii) we present Market-GAN, a novel architecture incorporating a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) for the controllable generation with context, an autoencoder for learning low-dimension features, and supervisors for knowledge transfer; iii) we introduce a two-stage training scheme to ensure that Market-GAN captures the intrinsic market distribution with multiple objectives. In the pertaining stage, with the use of the autoencoder and supervisors, we prepare the generator with a better initialization for the adversarial training stage. We propose a set of holistic evaluation metrics that consider alignment, fidelity, data usability on downstream tasks, and market facts. We evaluate Market-GAN with the Dow Jones Industrial Average data from 2000 to 2023 and showcase superior performance in comparison to 4 state-of-the-art time-series generative models. ",,,Y,Y,Y,Y
Generative Machine Learning for Multivariate Equity Returns,21/11/2023,"Ruslan Tepelyan, Achintya Gopal","The use of machine learning to generate synthetic data has grown in popularity with the proliferation of text-to-image models and especially large language models. The core methodology these models use is to learn the distribution of the underlying data, similar to the classical methods common in finance of fitting statistical models to data. In this work, we explore the efficacy of using modern machine learning methods, specifically conditional importance weighted autoencoders (a variant of variational autoencoders) and conditional normalizing flows, for the task of modeling the returns of equities. The main problem we work to address is modeling the joint distribution of all the members of the S&P 500, or, in other words, learning a 500-dimensional joint distribution. We show that this generative model has a broad range of applications in finance, including generating realistic synthetic data, volatility and correlation estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization.",,,N,N,N,Y
