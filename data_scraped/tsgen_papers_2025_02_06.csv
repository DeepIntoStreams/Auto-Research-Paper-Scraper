A Schema-Guided Reason-while-Retrieve framework for Reasoning on Scene Graphs with Large-Language-Models (LLMs),05/02/2025,"Yiye Chen, Harpreet Sawhney, Nicholas Gyd√©, Yanan Jian, Jack Saunders, Patricio Vela, Ben Lundell","Scene graphs have emerged as a structured and serializable environment
representation for grounded spatial reasoning with Large Language Models
(LLMs). In this work, we propose SG-RwR, a Schema-Guided Retrieve-while-Reason
framework for reasoning and planning with scene graphs. Our approach employs
two cooperative, code-writing LLM agents: a (1) Reasoner for task planning and
information queries generation, and a (2) Retriever for extracting
corresponding graph information following the queries. Two agents collaborate
iteratively, enabling sequential reasoning and adaptive attention to graph
information. Unlike prior works, both agents are prompted only with the scene
graph schema rather than the full graph data, which reduces the hallucination
by limiting input tokens, and drives the Reasoner to generate reasoning trace
abstractly.Following the trace, the Retriever programmatically query the scene
graph data based on the schema understanding, allowing dynamic and global
attention on the graph that enhances alignment between reasoning and retrieval.
Through experiments in multiple simulation environments, we show that our
framework surpasses existing LLM-based approaches in numerical Q\&A and
planning tasks, and can benefit from task-level few-shot examples, even in the
absence of agent-level demonstrations. Project code will be released.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03450v1,,False
Prediction of the Most Fire-Sensitive Point in Building Structures with Differentiable Agents for Thermal Simulators,05/02/2025,"Yuan Xinjie, Khalid M. Mosalam","Fire safety is a critical area of research in civil and mechanical
engineering, particularly in ensuring the structural stability of buildings
during fire events. The Most Fire-Sensitive Point (MFSP) in a structure is the
location where a fire would cause the greatest impact on structural stability.
Accurate prediction of the MFSP is vital for streamlining structural
assessments and optimizing the design process. This paper presents a novel
framework for MFSP prediction using a neural network-based approach that
integrates fire dynamics and finite element analysis through a differentiable
agent model. The framework focuses on predicting the Maximum Interstory Drift
Ratio (MIDR), a key indicator of structural performance under fire conditions.
By leveraging the differentiable agent model, we efficiently generate labeled
data for MFSP and directly train a predictor for this critical metric. To
achieve this, we generated extensive simulation data encompassing structural
and fire scenarios and employed graph neural networks to represent the building
structures. Transfer learning was applied to optimize the training process, and
an edge update mechanism was introduced to dynamically adjust edge attributes,
reflecting property changes under fire conditions. The proposed model was
rigorously evaluated on simulation data, demonstrating strong performance in
accurately predicting both MIDR and MFSP, thus advancing fire safety analysis
for building structures.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03424v1,,False
Lightweight Authenticated Task Offloading in 6G-Cloud Vehicular Twin Networks,05/02/2025,"Sarah Al-Shareeda, Fusun Ozguner, Keith Redmill, Trung Q. Duong, Berk Canberk","Task offloading management in 6G vehicular networks is crucial for
maintaining network efficiency, particularly as vehicles generate substantial
data. Integrating secure communication through authentication introduces
additional computational and communication overhead, significantly impacting
offloading efficiency and latency. This paper presents a unified framework
incorporating lightweight Identity-Based Cryptographic (IBC) authentication
into task offloading within cloud-based 6G Vehicular Twin Networks (VTNs).
Utilizing Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) in Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL), our approach optimizes authenticated offloading decisions to minimize
latency and enhance resource allocation. Performance evaluation under varying
network sizes, task sizes, and data rates reveals that IBC authentication can
reduce offloading efficiency by up to 50% due to the added overhead. Besides,
increasing network size and task size can further reduce offloading efficiency
by up to 91.7%. As a countermeasure, increasing the transmission data rate can
improve the offloading performance by as much as 63%, even in the presence of
authentication overhead. The code for the simulations and experiments detailed
in this paper is available on GitHub for further reference and reproducibility

Transformers and Their Roles as Time Series Foundation Models,05/02/2025,"Dennis Wu, Yihan He, Yuan Cao, Jianqing Fan, Han Liu","We give a comprehensive analysis of transformers as time series foundation
models, focusing on their approximation and generalization capabilities. First,
we demonstrate that there exist transformers that fit an autoregressive model

multivariate time series foundation model capable of handling an arbitrary
number of covariates. We prove that it is capable of automatically fitting
autoregressive models with an arbitrary number of covariates, offering insights
into its design and empirical success. For generalization, we establish bounds
for pretraining when the data satisfies Dobrushin's condition. Experiments
support our theoretical findings, highlighting the efficacy of transformers as
time series foundation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03383v1,,False
Energy-Efficient Flying LoRa Gateways: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Approach,05/02/2025,"Abdullahi Isa Ahmed, El Mehdi Amhoud","With the rapid development of next-generation Internet of Things (NG-IoT)
networks, the increasing number of connected devices has led to a surge in
power consumption. This rise in energy demand poses significant challenges to
resource availability and raises sustainability concerns for large-scale IoT
deployments. Efficient energy utilization in communication networks,
particularly for power-constrained IoT devices, has thus become a critical area
of research. In this paper, we deployed flying LoRa gateways (GWs) mounted on
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to collect data from LoRa end devices (EDs) and
transmit it to a central server. Our primary objective is to maximize the
global system energy efficiency (EE) of wireless LoRa networks by joint
optimization of transmission power (TP), spreading factor (SF), bandwidth (W),
and ED association. To solve this challenging problem, we model the problem as
a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), where each flying LoRa
GW acts as a learning agent using a cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement
Learning (MARL) approach under centralized training and decentralized execution
(CTDE). Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method, based on the
multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) algorithm, significantly
improves the global system EE and surpasses the conventional MARL schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03377v1,,False
A Beam's Eye View to Fluence Maps 3D Network for Ultra Fast VMAT Radiotherapy Planning,05/02/2025,"Simon Arberet, Florin C. Ghesu, Riqiang Gao, Martin Kraus, Jonathan Sackett, Esa Kuusela, Ali Kamen","Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) revolutionizes cancer treatment by
precisely delivering radiation while sparing healthy tissues. Fluence maps
generation, crucial in VMAT planning, traditionally involves complex and
iterative, and thus time consuming processes. These fluence maps are
subsequently leveraged for leaf-sequence. The deep-learning approach presented
in this article aims to expedite this by directly predicting fluence maps from
patient data. We developed a 3D network which we trained in a supervised way
using a combination of L1 and L2 losses, and RT plans generated by Eclipse and
from the REQUITE dataset, taking the RT dose map as input and the fluence maps
computed from the corresponding RT plans as target. Our network predicts
jointly the 180 fluence maps corresponding to the 180 control points (CP) of
single arc VMAT plans. In order to help the network, we pre-process the input
dose by computing the projections of the 3D dose map to the beam's eye view
(BEV) of the 180 CPs, in the same coordinate system as the fluence maps. We
generated over 2000 VMAT plans using Eclipse to scale up the dataset size.
Additionally, we evaluated various network architectures and analyzed the
impact of increasing the dataset size. We are measuring the performance in the
2D fluence maps domain using image metrics (PSNR, SSIM), as well as in the 3D
dose domain using the dose-volume histogram (DVH) on a validation dataset. The
network inference, which does not include the data loading and processing, is
less than 20ms. Using our proposed 3D network architecture as well as
increasing the dataset size using Eclipse improved the fluence map
reconstruction performance by approximately 8 dB in PSNR compared to a U-Net
architecture trained on the original REQUITE dataset. The resulting DVHs are
very close to the one of the input target dose.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03360v1,,False
IRIS: An Immersive Robot Interaction System,05/02/2025,"Xinkai Jiang, Qihao Yuan, Enes Ulas Dincer, Hongyi Zhou, Ge Li, Xueyin Li, Julius Haag, Nicolas Schreiber, Kailai Li, Gerhard Neumann, Rudolf Lioutikov","This paper introduces IRIS, an immersive Robot Interaction System leveraging
Extended Reality (XR), designed for robot data collection and interaction
across multiple simulators, benchmarks, and real-world scenarios. While
existing XR-based data collection systems provide efficient and intuitive
solutions for large-scale data collection, they are often challenging to
reproduce and reuse. This limitation arises because current systems are highly
tailored to simulator-specific use cases and environments. IRIS is a novel,
easily extendable framework that already supports multiple simulators,
benchmarks, and even headsets. Furthermore, IRIS is able to include additional
information from real-world sensors, such as point clouds captured through
depth cameras. A unified scene specification is generated directly from
simulators or real-world sensors and transmitted to XR headsets, creating
identical scenes in XR. This specification allows IRIS to support any of the
objects, assets, and robots provided by the simulators. In addition, IRIS
introduces shared spatial anchors and a robust communication protocol that
links simulations between multiple XR headsets. This feature enables multiple
XR headsets to share a synchronized scene, facilitating collaborative and
multi-user data collection. IRIS can be deployed on any device that supports
the Unity Framework, encompassing the vast majority of commercially available
headsets. In this work, IRIS was deployed and tested on the Meta Quest 3 and
the HoloLens 2. IRIS showcased its versatility across a wide range of
real-world and simulated scenarios, using current popular robot simulators such
as MuJoCo, IsaacSim, CoppeliaSim, and Genesis. In addition, a user study
evaluates IRIS on a data collection task for the LIBERO benchmark. The study
shows that IRIS significantly outperforms the baseline in both objective and
subjective metrics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03297v1,,False
Posterior SBC: Simulation-Based Calibration Checking Conditional on Data,05/02/2025,"Teemu S√§ilynoja, Marvin Schmitt, Paul B√ºrkner, Aki Vehtari","Simulation-based calibration checking (SBC) refers to the validation of an
inference algorithm and model implementation through repeated inference on data
simulated from a generative model. In the original and commonly used approach,
the generative model uses parameters drawn from the prior, and thus the
approach is testing whether the inference works for simulated data generated
with parameter values plausible under that prior. This approach is natural and
desirable when we want to test whether the inference works for a wide range of
datasets we might observe. However, after observing data, we are interested in
answering whether the inference works conditional on that particular data. In
this paper, we propose posterior SBC and demonstrate how it can be used to
validate the inference conditionally on observed data. We illustrate the
utility of posterior SBC in three case studies: (1) A simple multilevel model;
(2) a model that is governed by differential equations; and (3) a joint
integrative neuroscience model which is approximated via amortized Bayesian
inference with neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03279v1,,False
General Time-series Model for Universal Knowledge Representation of Multivariate Time-Series data,05/02/2025,"Cheng He, Xu Huang, Gangwei Jiang, Zhaoyi Li, Defu Lian, Hong Xie, Enhong Chen, Xijie Liang, Zengrong Zheng","Universal knowledge representation is a central problem for multivariate time
series(MTS) foundation models and yet remains open. This paper investigates
this problem from the first principle and it makes four folds of contributions.
First, a new empirical finding is revealed: time series with different time
granularities (or corresponding frequency resolutions) exhibit distinct joint
distributions in the frequency domain. This implies a crucial aspect of
learning universal knowledge, one that has been overlooked by previous studies.
Second, a novel Fourier knowledge attention mechanism is proposed to enable
learning time granularity-aware representations from both the temporal and
frequency domains. Third, an autoregressive blank infilling pre-training
framework is incorporated to time series analysis for the first time, leading
to a generative tasks agnostic pre-training strategy. To this end, we develop
the General Time-series Model (GTM), a unified MTS foundation model that
addresses the limitation of contemporary time series models, which often
require token, pre-training, or model-level customizations for downstream tasks
adaption. Fourth, extensive experiments show that GTM outperforms
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods across all generative tasks, including
long-term forecasting, anomaly detection, and imputation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03264v1,,False
Calibrated Unsupervised Anomaly Detection in Multivariate Time-series using Reinforcement Learning,05/02/2025,"Saba Sanami, Amir G. Aghdam","This paper investigates unsupervised anomaly detection in multivariate
time-series data using reinforcement learning (RL) in the latent space of an
autoencoder. A significant challenge is the limited availability of anomalous
data, often leading to misclassifying anomalies as normal events, thus raising
false negatives. RL can help overcome this limitation by promoting exploration
and balancing exploitation during training, effectively preventing overfitting.
Wavelet analysis is also utilized to enhance anomaly detection, enabling
time-series data decomposition into both time and frequency domains. This
approach captures anomalies at multiple resolutions, with wavelet coefficients
extracted to detect both sudden and subtle shifts in the data, thereby refining
the anomaly detection process. We calibrate the decision boundary by generating
synthetic anomalies and embedding a supervised framework within the model. This
supervised element aids the unsupervised learning process by fine-tuning the
decision boundary and increasing the model's capacity to distinguish between
normal and anomalous patterns effectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03245v1,,False
A Unified and General Humanoid Whole-Body Controller for Fine-Grained Locomotion,05/02/2025,"Yufei Xue, Wentao Dong, Minghuan Liu, Weinan Zhang, Jiangmiao Pang","Locomotion is a fundamental skill for humanoid robots. However, most existing
works made locomotion a single, tedious, unextendable, and passive movement.
This limits the kinematic capabilities of humanoid robots. In contrast, humans
possess versatile athletic abilities-running, jumping, hopping, and finely
adjusting walking parameters such as frequency, and foot height. In this paper,
we investigate solutions to bring such versatility into humanoid locomotion and
thereby propose HUGWBC: a unified and general humanoid whole-body controller
for fine-grained locomotion. By designing a general command space in the aspect
of tasks and behaviors, along with advanced techniques like symmetrical loss
and intervention training for learning a whole-body humanoid controlling policy
in simulation, HugWBC enables real-world humanoid robots to produce various
natural gaits, including walking (running), jumping, standing, and hopping,
with customizable parameters such as frequency, foot swing height, further
combined with different body height, waist rotation, and body pitch, all in one
single policy. Beyond locomotion, HUGWBC also supports real-time interventions
from external upper-body controllers like teleoperation, enabling
loco-manipulation while maintaining precise control under any locomotive
behavior. Our experiments validate the high tracking accuracy and robustness of
HUGWBC with/without upper-body intervention for all commands, and we further
provide an in-depth analysis of how the various commands affect humanoid
movement and offer insights into the relationships between these commands. To
our knowledge, HugWBC is the first humanoid whole-body controller that supports
such fine-grained locomotion behaviors with high robustness and flexibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03206v1,,False
SimSort: A Powerful Framework for Spike Sorting by Large-Scale Electrophysiology Simulation,05/02/2025,"Yimu Zhang, Dongqi Han, Yansen Wang, Yu Gu, Dongsheng Li","Spike sorting is an essential process in neural recording, which identifies
and separates electrical signals from individual neurons recorded by electrodes
in the brain, enabling researchers to study how specific neurons communicate
and process information. Although there exist a number of spike sorting methods
which have contributed to significant neuroscientific breakthroughs, many are
heuristically designed, making it challenging to verify their correctness due
to the difficulty of obtaining ground truth labels from real-world neural
recordings. In this work, we explore a data-driven, deep learning-based
approach. We begin by creating a large-scale dataset through electrophysiology
simulations using biologically realistic computational models. We then present
\textbf{SimSort}, a pretraining framework for spike sorting. Remarkably, when
trained on our simulated dataset, SimSort demonstrates strong zero-shot
generalization to real-world spike sorting tasks, significantly outperforming
existing methods. Our findings underscore the potential of data-driven

PICBench: Benchmarking LLMs for Photonic Integrated Circuits Design,05/02/2025,"Yuchao Wu, Xiaofei Yu, Hao Chen, Yang Luo, Yeyu Tong, Yuzhe Ma","While large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable potential in
automating various tasks in digital chip design, the field of Photonic
Integrated Circuits (PICs)-a promising solution to advanced chip

time-consuming and prone to errors due to the extensive and repetitive nature
of code involved in photonic chip design. In this paper, we introduce PICBench,
the first benchmarking and evaluation framework specifically designed to
automate PIC design generation using LLMs, where the generated output takes the

Scalable In-Context Learning on Tabular Data via Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models,05/02/2025,"Xumeng Wen, Shun Zheng, Zhen Xu, Yiming Sun, Jiang Bian","Recent studies have shown that large language models (LLMs), when customized
with post-training on tabular data, can acquire general tabular in-context
learning (TabICL) capabilities. These models are able to transfer effectively
across diverse data schemas and different task domains. However, existing
LLM-based TabICL approaches are constrained to few-shot scenarios due to the
sequence length limitations of LLMs, as tabular instances represented in plain
text consume substantial tokens. To address this limitation and enable scalable
TabICL for any data size, we propose retrieval-augmented LLMs tailored to
tabular data. Our approach incorporates a customized retrieval module, combined
with retrieval-guided instruction-tuning for LLMs. This enables LLMs to
effectively leverage larger datasets, achieving significantly improved
performance across 69 widely recognized datasets and demonstrating promising
scaling behavior. Extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art tabular models
reveal that, while LLM-based TabICL still lags behind well-tuned numeric models

Fast Sampling of Cosmological Initial Conditions with Gaussian Neural Posterior Estimation,05/02/2025,"Oleg Savchenko, Guillermo Franco Abell√°n, Florian List, Noemi Anau Montel, Christoph Weniger","Knowledge of the primordial matter density field from which the large-scale
structure of the Universe emerged over cosmic time is of fundamental importance
for cosmology. However, reconstructing these cosmological initial conditions
from late-time observations is a notoriously difficult task, which requires
advanced cosmological simulators and sophisticated statistical methods to
explore a multi-million-dimensional parameter space. We show how
simulation-based inference (SBI) can be used to tackle this problem and to
obtain data-constrained realisations of the primordial dark matter density
field in a simulation-efficient way with general non-differentiable simulators.
Our method is applicable to full high-resolution dark matter $N$-body
simulations and is based on modelling the posterior distribution of the
constrained initial conditions to be Gaussian with a diagonal covariance matrix
in Fourier space. As a result, we can generate thousands of posterior samples
within seconds on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than existing
methods, paving the way for sequential SBI for cosmological fields.
Furthermore, we perform an analytical fit of the estimated dependence of the
covariance on the wavenumber, effectively transforming any point-estimator of
initial conditions into a fast sampler. We test the validity of our obtained
samples by comparing them to the true values with summary statistics and
performing a Bayesian consistency test.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.03139v1,,False
Underwater Soft Fin Flapping Motion with Deep Neural Network Based Surrogate Model,05/02/2025,"Yuya Hamamatsu, Pavlo Kupyn, Roza Gkliva, Asko Ristolainen, Maarja Kruusmaa","This study presents a novel framework for precise force control of

Understanding and Enhancing the Transferability of Jailbreaking Attacks,05/02/2025,"Runqi Lin, Bo Han, Fengwang Li, Tongling Liu","Jailbreaking attacks can effectively manipulate open-source large language
models (LLMs) to produce harmful responses. However, these attacks exhibit
limited transferability, failing to disrupt proprietary LLMs consistently. To
reliably identify vulnerabilities in proprietary LLMs, this work investigates
the transferability of jailbreaking attacks by analysing their impact on the
model's intent perception. By incorporating adversarial sequences, these
attacks can redirect the source LLM's focus away from malicious-intent tokens
in the original input, thereby obstructing the model's intent recognition and
eliciting harmful responses. Nevertheless, these adversarial sequences fail to
mislead the target LLM's intent perception, allowing the target LLM to refocus
on malicious-intent tokens and abstain from responding. Our analysis further
reveals the inherent distributional dependency within the generated adversarial
sequences, whose effectiveness stems from overfitting the source LLM's
parameters, resulting in limited transferability to target LLMs. To this end,
we propose the Perceived-importance Flatten (PiF) method, which uniformly
disperses the model's focus across neutral-intent tokens in the original input,
thus obscuring malicious-intent tokens without relying on overfitted
adversarial sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiF provides an

"Label Anything: An Interpretable, High-Fidelity and Prompt-Free Annotator",05/02/2025,"Wei-Bin Kou, Guangxu Zhu, Rongguang Ye, Shuai Wang, Ming Tang, Yik-Chung Wu","Learning-based street scene semantic understanding in autonomous driving (AD)
has advanced significantly recently, but the performance of the AD model is
heavily dependent on the quantity and quality of the annotated training data.
However, traditional manual labeling involves high cost to annotate the vast
amount of required data for training robust model. To mitigate this cost of
manual labeling, we propose a Label Anything Model (denoted as LAM), serving as
an interpretable, high-fidelity, and prompt-free data annotator. Specifically,
we firstly incorporate a pretrained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract the
latent features. On top of ViT, we propose a semantic class adapter (SCA) and
an optimization-oriented unrolling algorithm (OptOU), both with a quite small
number of trainable parameters. SCA is proposed to fuse ViT-extracted features
to consolidate the basis of the subsequent automatic annotation. OptOU consists
of multiple cascading layers and each layer contains an optimization
formulation to align its output with the ground truth as closely as possible,
though which OptOU acts as being interpretable rather than learning-based
blackbox nature. In addition, training SCA and OptOU requires only a single
pre-annotated RGB seed image, owing to their small volume of learnable
parameters. Extensive experiments clearly demonstrate that the proposed LAM can
generate high-fidelity annotations (almost 100% in mIoU) for multiple

LLM-KT: Aligning Large Language Models with Knowledge Tracing using a Plug-and-Play Instruction,05/02/2025,"Ziwei Wang, Jie Zhou, Qin Chen, Min Zhang, Bo Jiang, Aimin Zhou, Qinchun Bai, Liang He","The knowledge tracing (KT) problem is an extremely important topic in
personalized education, which aims to predict whether students can correctly
answer the next question based on their past question-answer records. Prior
work on this task mainly focused on learning the sequence of behaviors based on

students' sufficient behavioral patterns without reasoning with rich world
knowledge about questions. In this paper, we propose a large language models

strengths of LLMs and traditional sequence interaction models. For task-level
alignment, we design Plug-and-Play instruction to align LLMs with KT,
leveraging LLMs' rich knowledge and powerful reasoning capacity. For
modality-level alignment, we design the plug-in context and sequence to
integrate multiple modalities learned by traditional methods. To capture the
long context of history records, we present a plug-in context to flexibly
insert the compressed context embedding into LLMs using question-specific and

of its representations, applying an instance-wise contrastive loss to capture
distinct flow-specific characteristics. Additionally, we develop a regularizer
to align output features with these flow-specific representations, enabling a
more comprehensive understanding of mobility dynamics. To validate our model,
we conduct extensive experiments in Chicago, New York, and Washington, D.C. to

traditional analytic methods. Tree-exploiting PSRO (TE-PSRO) is a variant of
this approach that iteratively builds a coarsened empirical game model in
extensive form using data obtained from querying a simulator that represents a
detailed description of the game. We make two main methodological advances to
TE-PSRO that enhance its applicability to complex games of imperfect
information. First, we introduce a scalable representation for the empirical
game tree where edges correspond to implicit policies learned through DRL.
These policies cover conditions in the underlying game abstracted in the game
model, supporting sustainable growth of the tree over epochs. Second, we
leverage extensive form in the empirical model by employing refined Nash
equilibria to direct strategy exploration. To enable this, we give a modular
and scalable algorithm based on generalized backward induction for computing a
subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) in an imperfect-information game. We
experimentally evaluate our approach on a suite of games including an
