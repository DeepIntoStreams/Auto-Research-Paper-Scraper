RoboTwin: Dual-Arm Robot Benchmark with Generative Digital Twins (early version),04/09/2024,"Yao Mu, Tianxing Chen, Shijia Peng, Zanxin Chen, Zeyu Gao, Yude Zou, Lunkai Lin, Zhiqiang Xie, Ping Luo","Effective collaboration of dual-arm robots and their tool use capabilities
are increasingly important areas in the advancement of robotics. These skills
play a significant role in expanding robots' ability to operate in diverse
real-world environments. However, progress is impeded by the scarcity of
specialized training data. This paper introduces RoboTwin, a novel benchmark
dataset combining real-world teleoperated data with synthetic data from digital
twins, designed for dual-arm robotic scenarios. Using the COBOT Magic platform,
we have collected diverse data on tool usage and human-robot interaction. We
present a innovative approach to creating digital twins using AI-generated
content, transforming 2D images into detailed 3D models. Furthermore, we
utilize large language models to generate expert-level training data and
task-specific pose sequences oriented toward functionality. Our key
contributions are: 1) the RoboTwin benchmark dataset, 2) an efficient
real-to-simulation pipeline, and 3) the use of language models for automatic
expert-level data generation. These advancements are designed to address the
shortage of robotic training data, potentially accelerating the development of
more capable and versatile robotic systems for a wide range of real-world

Hybrid Imitation-Learning Motion Planner for Urban Driving,04/09/2024,"Cristian Gariboldi, Matteo Corno, Beng Jin","With the release of open source datasets such as nuPlan and Argoverse, the
research around learning-based planners has spread a lot in the last years.
Existing systems have shown excellent capabilities in imitating the human
driver behaviour, but they struggle to guarantee safe closed-loop driving.
Conversely, optimization-based planners offer greater security in short-term
planning scenarios. To confront this challenge, in this paper we propose a
novel hybrid motion planner that integrates both learning-based and
optimization-based techniques. Initially, a multilayer perceptron (MLP)
generates a human-like trajectory, which is then refined by an
optimization-based component. This component not only minimizes tracking errors
but also computes a trajectory that is both kinematically feasible and
collision-free with obstacles and road boundaries. Our model effectively
balances safety and human-likeness, mitigating the trade-off inherent in these
objectives. We validate our approach through simulation experiments and further
demonstrate its efficacy by deploying it in real-world self-driving vehicles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02871v1,,False
"Building a Scalable, Effective, and Steerable Search and Ranking Platform",04/09/2024,"Marjan Celikik, Jacek Wasilewski, Ana Peleteiro Ramallo, Alexey Kurennoy, Evgeny Labzin, Danilo Ascione, Tural Gurbanov, Géraud Le Falher, Andrii Dzhoha, Ian Harris","Modern e-commerce platforms offer vast product selections, making it
difficult for customers to find items that they like and that are relevant to
their current session intent. This is why it is key for e-commerce platforms to
have near real-time scalable and adaptable personalized ranking and search
systems. While numerous methods exist in the scientific literature for building
such systems, many are unsuitable for large-scale industrial use due to
complexity and performance limitations. Consequently, industrial ranking
systems often resort to computationally efficient yet simplistic retrieval or
candidate generation approaches, which overlook near real-time and
heterogeneous customer signals, which results in a less personalized and
relevant experience. Moreover, related customer experiences are served by
completely different systems, which increases complexity, maintenance, and
inconsistent experiences.
  In this paper, we present a personalized, adaptable near real-time ranking
platform that is reusable across various use cases, such as browsing and
search, and that is able to cater to millions of items and customers under
heavy load (thousands of requests per second). We employ transformer-based
models through different ranking layers which can learn complex behavior
patterns directly from customer action sequences while being able to
incorporate temporal (e.g. in-session) and contextual information. We validate
our system through a series of comprehensive offline and online real-world
experiments at a large online e-commerce platform, and we demonstrate its
superiority when compared to existing systems, both in terms of customer
experience as well as in net revenue. Finally, we share the lessons learned
from building a comprehensive, modern ranking platform for use in a large-scale
e-commerce environment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02856v1,,False
Regularized Multi-output Gaussian Convolution Process with Domain Adaptation,04/09/2024,"Wang Xinming, Wang Chao, Song Xuan, Kirby Levi, Wu Jianguo","Multi-output Gaussian process (MGP) has been attracting increasing attention
as a transfer learning method to model multiple outputs. Despite its high
flexibility and generality, MGP still faces two critical challenges when
applied to transfer learning. The first one is negative transfer, which occurs
when there exists no shared information among the outputs. The second challenge
is the input domain inconsistency, which is commonly studied in transfer
learning yet not explored in MGP. In this paper, we propose a regularized MGP
modeling framework with domain adaptation to overcome these challenges. More
specifically, a sparse covariance matrix of MGP is proposed by using
convolution process, where penalization terms are added to adaptively select
the most informative outputs for knowledge transfer. To deal with the domain
inconsistency, a domain adaptation method is proposed by marginalizing
inconsistent features and expanding missing features to align the input domains
among different outputs. Statistical properties of the proposed method are
provided to guarantee the performance practically and asymptotically. The
proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks in comprehensive
simulation studies and one real case study of a ceramic manufacturing process.
The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in dealing with both
the negative transfer and the domain inconsistency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02778v1,10.1109/TPAMI.2022.3205036,False
Task-Oriented Communication for Graph Data: A Graph Information Bottleneck Approach,04/09/2024,"Shujing Li, Yanhu Wang, Shuaishuai Guo, Chenyuan Feng","Graph data, essential in fields like knowledge representation and social
networks, often involves large networks with many nodes and edges. Transmitting
these graphs can be highly inefficient due to their size and redundancy for
specific tasks. This paper introduces a method to extract a smaller,
task-focused subgraph that maintains key information while reducing
communication overhead. Our approach utilizes graph neural networks (GNNs) and
the graph information bottleneck (GIB) principle to create a compact,
informative, and robust graph representation suitable for transmission. The
challenge lies in the irregular structure of graph data, making GIB
optimization complex. We address this by deriving a tractable variational upper
bound for the objective function. Additionally, we propose the VQ-GIB
mechanism, integrating vector quantization (VQ) to convert subgraph
representations into a discrete codebook sequence, compatible with existing
digital communication systems. Our experiments show that this GIB-based method
significantly lowers communication costs while preserving essential
task-related information. The approach demonstrates robust performance across
various communication channels, suitable for both continuous and discrete
systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02728v1,,False
Neural Networks with LSTM and GRU in Modeling Active Fires in the Amazon,04/09/2024,Ramon Tavares,"This study presents a comprehensive methodology for modeling and forecasting
the historical time series of fire spots detected by the AQUA_M-T satellite in
the Amazon, Brazil. The approach utilizes a mixed Recurrent Neural Network
(RNN) model, combining Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU) architectures to predict monthly accumulations of daily detected fire
spots. A summary of the data revealed a consistent seasonality over time, with
annual maximum and minimum fire spot values tending to repeat at the same
periods each year. The primary objective is to verify whether the forecasts
capture this inherent seasonality through rigorous statistical analysis. The
methodology involved careful data preparation, model configuration, and
training using cross-validation with two seeds, ensuring that the data
generalizes well to the test and validation sets, and confirming the
convergence of the model parameters. The results indicate that the mixed LSTM
and GRU model offers improved accuracy in forecasting 12 months ahead,
demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing complex temporal patterns and
modeling the observed time series. This research significantly contributes to
the application of deep learning techniques in environmental monitoring,
specifically in fire spot forecasting. In addition to improving forecast
accuracy, the proposed approach highlights the potential for adaptation to
other time series forecasting challenges, opening new avenues for research and
development in machine learning and natural phenomenon prediction. Keywords:

Advancing Cyber Incident Timeline Analysis Through Rule Based AI and Large Language Models,04/09/2024,"Fatma Yasmine Loumachi, Mohamed Chahine Ghanem","Timeline Analysis (TA) is a key part of Timeline Forensics (TF) in Digital
Forensics (DF), focusing primarily on examining and analysing temporal digital
artefacts such as timestamps, derived from event logs, file metadata, and other
related data to correlate events resulting from cyber incidents and reconstruct
their chronological timeline. Traditional tools often struggle to efficiently
process the vast volume and variety of data acquired during DF investigations
and Incident Response (IR) processes. This paper presents a novel framework,
GenDFIR, that combines Rule-Based Artificial Intelligence (R-BAI) algorithms
with Large Language Models (LLMs) to advance and automate the TA process. Our
approach consists of two main stages (1) We use R-BAI to identify and select
anomalous digital artefacts based on predefined rules. (2) The selected
artefacts are then converted into embeddings for processing by an LLM with the
help of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. The LLM consequently
leverages its capabilities to perform automated TA on the artefacts and predict
potential incident scenarios. To validate our framework, we evaluate GenDFIR
performance, efficiency, and reliability using various metrics across synthetic
cyber incident simulation scenarios. This paper presents a proof of concept,
where the findings demonstrate the significant potential of integrating R-BAI
and LLMs for TA. This novel approach highlights the power of Generative AI

Cog-GA: A Large Language Models-based Generative Agent for Vision-Language Navigation in Continuous Environments,04/09/2024,"Zhiyuan Li, Yanfeng Lu, Yao Mu, Hong Qiao","Vision Language Navigation in Continuous Environments (VLN-CE) represents a
frontier in embodied AI, demanding agents to navigate freely in unbounded 3D
spaces solely guided by natural language instructions. This task introduces
distinct challenges in multimodal comprehension, spatial reasoning, and
decision-making. To address these challenges, we introduce Cog-GA, a generative
agent founded on large language models (LLMs) tailored for VLN-CE tasks. Cog-GA
employs a dual-pronged strategy to emulate human-like cognitive processes.
Firstly, it constructs a cognitive map, integrating temporal, spatial, and
semantic elements, thereby facilitating the development of spatial memory
within LLMs. Secondly, Cog-GA employs a predictive mechanism for waypoints,
strategically optimizing the exploration trajectory to maximize navigational
efficiency. Each waypoint is accompanied by a dual-channel scene description,
categorizing environmental cues into 'what' and 'where' streams as the brain.
This segregation enhances the agent's attentional focus, enabling it to discern
pertinent spatial information for navigation. A reflective mechanism
complements these strategies by capturing feedback from prior navigation
experiences, facilitating continual learning and adaptive replanning. Extensive
evaluations conducted on VLN-CE benchmarks validate Cog-GA's state-of-the-art
performance and ability to simulate human-like navigation behaviors. This
research significantly contributes to the development of strategic and
interpretable VLN-CE agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02522v1,,False
Reliable Deep Diffusion Tensor Estimation: Rethinking the Power of Data-Driven Optimization Routine,04/09/2024,"Jialong Li, Zhicheng Zhang, Yunwei Chen, Qiqi Lu, Ye Wu, Xiaoming Liu, QianJin Feng, Yanqiu Feng, Xinyuan Zhang","Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) holds significant importance in clinical
diagnosis and neuroscience research. However, conventional model-based fitting
methods often suffer from sensitivity to noise, leading to decreased accuracy
in estimating DTI parameters. While traditional data-driven deep learning
methods have shown potential in terms of accuracy and efficiency, their limited
generalization to out-of-training-distribution data impedes their broader
application due to the diverse scan protocols used across centers, scanners,
and studies. This work aims to tackle these challenges and promote the use of
DTI by introducing a data-driven optimization-based method termed DoDTI. DoDTI
combines the weighted linear least squares fitting algorithm and regularization
by denoising technique. The former fits DW images from diverse acquisition
settings into diffusion tensor field, while the latter applies a deep
learning-based denoiser to regularize the diffusion tensor field instead of the
DW images, which is free from the limitation of fixed-channel assignment of the
network. The optimization object is solved using the alternating direction
method of multipliers and then unrolled to construct a deep neural network,
leveraging a data-driven strategy to learn network parameters. Extensive
validation experiments are conducted utilizing both internally simulated
datasets and externally obtained in-vivo datasets. The results, encompassing
both qualitative and quantitative analyses, showcase that the proposed method
attains state-of-the-art performance in DTI parameter estimation. Notably, it
demonstrates superior generalization, accuracy, and efficiency, rendering it
highly reliable for widespread application in the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02492v1,,False
Diffusion Models Learn Low-Dimensional Distributions via Subspace Clustering,04/09/2024,"Peng Wang, Huijie Zhang, Zekai Zhang, Siyi Chen, Yi Ma, Qing Qu","Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that diffusion models can
effectively learn the image distribution and generate new samples. Remarkably,
these models can achieve this even with a small number of training samples
despite a large image dimension, circumventing the curse of dimensionality. In
this work, we provide theoretical insights into this phenomenon by leveraging
key empirical observations: (i) the low intrinsic dimensionality of image data,
(ii) a union of manifold structure of image data, and (iii) the low-rank
property of the denoising autoencoder in trained diffusion models. These
observations motivate us to assume the underlying data distribution of image
data as a mixture of low-rank Gaussians and to parameterize the denoising
autoencoder as a low-rank model according to the score function of the assumed
distribution. With these setups, we rigorously show that optimizing the
training loss of diffusion models is equivalent to solving the canonical
subspace clustering problem over the training samples. Based on this
equivalence, we further show that the minimal number of samples required to
learn the underlying distribution scales linearly with the intrinsic dimensions
under the above data and model assumptions. This insight sheds light on why
diffusion models can break the curse of dimensionality and exhibit the phase
transition in learning distributions. Moreover, we empirically establish a
correspondence between the subspaces and the semantic representations of image
data, facilitating image editing. We validate these results with corroborated
experimental results on both simulated distributions and image datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02426v1,,False

Learning Privacy-Preserving Student Networks via Discriminative-Generative Distillation,04/09/2024,"Shiming Ge, Bochao Liu, Pengju Wang, Yong Li, Dan Zeng","While deep models have proved successful in learning rich knowledge from
massive well-annotated data, they may pose a privacy leakage risk in practical
deployment. It is necessary to find an effective trade-off between high utility
and strong privacy. In this work, we propose a discriminative-generative
distillation approach to learn privacy-preserving deep models. Our key idea is
taking models as bridge to distill knowledge from private data and then
transfer it to learn a student network via two streams. First, discriminative
stream trains a baseline classifier on private data and an ensemble of teachers
on multiple disjoint private subsets, respectively. Then, generative stream
takes the classifier as a fixed discriminator and trains a generator in a
data-free manner. After that, the generator is used to generate massive
synthetic data which are further applied to train a variational autoencoder
(VAE). Among these synthetic data, a few of them are fed into the teacher
ensemble to query labels via differentially private aggregation, while most of
them are embedded to the trained VAE for reconstructing synthetic data.
Finally, a semi-supervised student learning is performed to simultaneously
handle two tasks: knowledge transfer from the teachers with distillation on few
privately labeled synthetic data, and knowledge enhancement with tangent-normal
adversarial regularization on many triples of reconstructed synthetic data. In
this way, our approach can control query cost over private data and mitigate
accuracy degradation in a unified manner, leading to a privacy-preserving
student model. Extensive experiments and analysis clearly show the
effectiveness of the proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02404v1,10.1109/TIP.2022.3226416,False
Neural Dynamics Model of Visual Decision-Making: Learning from Human Experts,04/09/2024,"Jie Su, Fang Cai, Shu-Kuo Zhao, Xin-Yi Wang, Tian-Yi Qian, Da-Hui Wang, Bo Hong","Uncovering the fundamental neural correlates of biological intelligence,
developing mathematical models, and conducting computational simulations are
critical for advancing new paradigms in artificial intelligence (AI). In this
study, we implemented a comprehensive visual decision-making model that spans

approach. Drawing inspiration from the key components of the dorsal visual
pathway in primates, our model not only aligns closely with human behavior but
also reflects neural activities in primates, and achieving accuracy comparable

(MRI) identified key neuroimaging features such as structural connections and
functional connectivity that are associated with performance in perceptual
decision-making tasks. A neuroimaging-informed fine-tuning approach was
introduced and applied to the model, leading to performance improvements that
paralleled the behavioral variations observed among subjects. Compared to

Machine Learning Applications to Computational Plasma Physics and Reduced-Order Plasma Modeling: A Perspective,04/09/2024,"Farbod Faraji, Maryam Reza","Machine learning (ML) provides a broad spectrum of tools and architectures
that enable the transformation of data from simulations and experiments into
useful and explainable science, thereby augmenting domain knowledge.
Furthermore, ML-enhanced numerical modelling can revamp scientific computing
for real-world complex engineering systems, creating unique opportunities to
examine the operation of the technologies in detail and automate their
optimization and control. In recent years, ML applications have seen
significant growth across various scientific domains, particularly in fluid
mechanics, where ML has shown great promise in enhancing computational modeling
of fluid flows. In contrast, ML applications in numerical plasma physics
research remain relatively limited in scope and extent. Despite this, the close
relationship between fluid mechanics and plasma physics presents a valuable
opportunity to create a roadmap for transferring ML advances in fluid flow

Generative Principal Component Regression via Variational Inference,03/09/2024,"Austin Talbot, Corey J Keller, David E Carlson, Alex V Kotlar","The ability to manipulate complex systems, such as the brain, to modify
specific outcomes has far-reaching implications, particularly in the treatment
of psychiatric disorders. One approach to designing appropriate manipulations
is to target key features of predictive models. While generative latent
variable models, such as probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA), is
a powerful tool for identifying targets, they struggle incorporating
information relevant to low-variance outcomes into the latent space. When
stimulation targets are designed on the latent space in such a scenario, the
intervention can be suboptimal with minimal efficacy. To address this problem,
we develop a novel objective based on supervised variational autoencoders
(SVAEs) that enforces such information is represented in the latent space. The
novel objective can be used with linear models, such as PPCA, which we refer to
as generative principal component regression (gPCR). We show in simulations
that gPCR dramatically improves target selection in manipulation as compared to
standard PCR and SVAEs. As part of these simulations, we develop a metric for
detecting when relevant information is not properly incorporated into the
loadings. We then show in two neural datasets related to stress and social
behavior in which gPCR dramatically outperforms PCR in predictive performance
and that SVAEs exhibit low incorporation of relevant information into the
loadings. Overall, this work suggests that our method significantly improves
target selection for manipulation using latent variable models over competitor
inference schemes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02327v1,,False
TimeDiT: General-purpose Diffusion Transformers for Time Series Foundation Model,03/09/2024,"Defu Cao, Wen Ye, Yizhou Zhang, Yan Liu","With recent advances in building foundation models for texts and video data,
there is a surge of interest in foundation models for time series. A family of
models have been developed, utilizing a temporal auto-regressive generative
Transformer architecture, whose effectiveness has been proven in Large Language
Models. While the empirical results are promising, almost all existing time
series foundation models have only been tested on well-curated ``benchmark''
datasets very similar to texts. However, real-world time series exhibit unique
challenges, such as variable channel sizes across domains, missing values, and
varying signal sampling intervals due to the multi-resolution nature of
real-world data. Additionally, the uni-directional nature of temporally
auto-regressive decoding limits the incorporation of domain knowledge, such as
physical laws expressed as partial differential equations (PDEs). To address
these challenges, we introduce the Time Diffusion Transformer (TimeDiT), a
general foundation model for time series that employs a denoising diffusion
paradigm instead of temporal auto-regressive generation. TimeDiT leverages the
Transformer architecture to capture temporal dependencies and employs diffusion
processes to generate high-quality candidate samples without imposing stringent
assumptions on the target distribution via novel masking schemes and a channel
alignment strategy. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning-free model editing
strategy that allows the seamless integration of external knowledge during the

TransDAE: Dual Attention Mechanism in a Hierarchical Transformer for Efficient Medical Image Segmentation,03/09/2024,"Bobby Azad, Pourya Adibfar, Kaiqun Fu","In healthcare, medical image segmentation is crucial for accurate disease
diagnosis and the development of effective treatment strategies. Early
detection can significantly aid in managing diseases and potentially prevent
their progression. Machine learning, particularly deep convolutional neural
networks, has emerged as a promising approach to addressing segmentation
challenges. Traditional methods like U-Net use encoding blocks for local
representation modeling and decoding blocks to uncover semantic relationships.
However, these models often struggle with multi-scale objects exhibiting

aggregate claim amount. To facilitate frequency-severity modeling, we
investigate BCART models for the right-skewed and heavy-tailed claim severity
data by using various distributions. We discover that the Weibull distribution
is superior to gamma and lognormal distributions, due to its ability to capture
different tail characteristics in tree models. Additionally, we find that
sequential BCART models and joint BCART models, which incorporate dependence

Uncertainty Quantification Using Ensemble Learning and Monte Carlo Sampling for Performance Prediction and Monitoring in Cell Culture Processes,03/09/2024,"Thanh Tung Khuat, Robert Bassett, Ellen Otte, Bogdan Gabrys","Biopharmaceutical products, particularly monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), have
gained prominence in the pharmaceutical market due to their high specificity

Optimal Power Grid Operations with Foundation Models,03/09/2024,"Alban Puech, Jonas Weiss, Thomas Brunschwiler, Hendrik F. Hamann","The energy transition, crucial for tackling the climate crisis, demands

Graphons of Line Graphs,03/09/2024,"Sevvandi Kandanaarachchi, Cheng Soon Ong","A graphon is the limit of a converging graph sequence. Graphons of dense
graphs are useful as they can act as a blueprint and generate graphs of
arbitrary size with similar properties. But for sparse graphs this is not the
case. Sparse graphs converge to the zero graphon, making the generated graphs
empty or edgeless. Thus, the classical graphon definition fails for sparse
graphs. Several methods have been proposed to overcome this limitation and to
understand sparse graphs more deeply. However, the fragile nature of sparse
graphs makes these methods mathematically complex. In this paper we show a
simple method that can shed light on a certain subset of sparse graphs. The
method involves mapping the original graphs to their line graphs. Line graphs
map edges to vertices and connects edges when edges in the original graph share
a vertex. We show that graphs satisfying a particular property, which we call
the square-degree property are sparse, but give rise to dense line graphs. In
particular, star graphs satisfy the square-degree property resulting in dense
line graphs and non-zero graphons of line graphs. Similarly, superlinear
preferential attachment graphs give rise to dense line graphs almost surely. In
contrast, dense graphs, including Erdos-Renyi graphs make the line graphs
sparse, resulting in the zero graphon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01656v1,,False
A Time-Intensity Aware Pipeline for Generating Late-Stage Breast DCE-MRI using Generative Adversarial Models,03/09/2024,"Ruben D. Fonnegra, Maria Liliana Hernández, Juan C. Caicedo, Gloria M. Díaz","Contrast-enhancement pattern analysis is critical in breast magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish benign from probably malignant tumors.
However, contrast-enhanced image acquisitions are time-consuming and very
expensive. As an alternative to physical acquisition, this paper proposes a
comprehensive pipeline for the generation of accurate long-term (late)
contrast-enhanced breast MRI from the early counterpart. The proposed strategy
focuses on preserving the contrast agent pattern in the enhanced regions while
maintaining visual properties in the entire synthesized images. To that end, a
novel loss function that leverages the biological behavior of contrast agent
(CA) in tissue, given by the Time-Intensity (TI) enhancement curve, is proposed
to optimize a pixel-attention based generative model. In addition, unlike
traditional normalization and standardization methods, we developed a new
normalization strategy that maintains the contrast enhancement pattern across
the image sequences at multiple timestamps. This ensures the prevalence of the
CA pattern after image preprocessing, unlike conventional approaches.
Furthermore, in order to objectively evaluate the clinical quality of the
synthesized images, two metrics are also introduced to measure the differences
between the TI curves of enhanced regions of the acquired and synthesized
images. The experimental results showed that the proposed strategy generates
images that significantly outperform diagnostic quality in contrast-enhanced
regions while maintaining the spatial features of the entire image. This
results suggest a potential use of synthetic late enhanced images generated via

Learning out-of-time-ordered correlators with classical kernel methods,03/09/2024,"John Tanner, Jason Pye, Jingbo Wang","Out-of-Time Ordered Correlators (OTOCs) are widely used to investigate
information scrambling in quantum systems. However, directly computing OTOCs
with classical computers is often impractical. This is due to the need to
simulate the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, which entails
exponentially-scaling computational costs with system size. Similarly, exact
simulation of the dynamics with a quantum computer (QC) will generally require
a fault-tolerant QC, which is currently beyond technological capabilities.
Therefore, alternative approaches are needed for computing OTOCs and related
quantities. In this study, we explore four parameterised sets of Hamiltonians
describing quantum systems of interest in condensed matter physics. For each
set, we investigate whether classical kernel methods can accurately learn the
XZ-OTOC as well as a particular sum of OTOCs, as functions of the Hamiltonian
parameters. We frame the problem as a regression task, generating labelled data
via an efficient numerical algorithm that utilises matrix product operators to
simulate quantum many-body systems, with up to 40 qubits. Using this data, we
train a variety of standard kernel machines and observe that the best kernels
consistently achieve a high coefficient of determination ($R^2$) on the testing
sets, typically between 0.9 and 0.99, and almost always exceeding 0.8. This
demonstrates that classical kernels supplied with a moderate amount of training

puts forward a novel data simulation method to address this issue, leveraging
noise-extractive techniques and generative adversarial networks (GANs) with
only limited target noisy speech data. Notably, our method employs a noise
encoder to extract noise embeddings from target-domain data. These embeddings
aptly guide the generator to synthesize utterances acoustically fitted to the
target domain while authentically preserving the phonetic content of the input
clean speech. Furthermore, we introduce the notion of dynamic stochastic

A causal viewpoint on prediction model performance under changes in case-mix: discrimination and calibration respond differently for prognosis and diagnosis predictions,02/09/2024,Wouter A. C. van Amsterdam,"Prediction models inform important clinical decisions, aiding in diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment planning. The predictive performance of these models
is typically assessed through discrimination and calibration. However, changes
in the distribution of the data impact model performance. In health-care, a
typical change is a shift in case-mix: for example, for cardiovascular risk
managment, a general practitioner sees a different mix of patients than a
specialist in a tertiary hospital.
  This work introduces a novel framework that differentiates the effects of
case-mix shifts on discrimination and calibration based on the causal direction
of the prediction task. When prediction is in the causal direction (often the
case for prognosis preditions), calibration remains stable under case-mix
shifts, while discrimination does not. Conversely, when predicting in the
anti-causal direction (often with diagnosis predictions), discrimination
remains stable, but calibration does not.
  A simulation study and empirical validation using cardiovascular disease
prediction models demonstrate the implications of this framework. This

Self-Directed Learning of Convex Labelings on Graphs,02/09/2024,"Georgy Sokolov, Maximilian Thiessen, Margarita Akhmejanova, Fabio Vitale, Francesco Orabona","We study the problem of learning the clusters of a given graph in the
self-directed learning setup. This learning setting is a variant of online
learning, where rather than an adversary determining the sequence in which
nodes are presented, the learner autonomously and adaptively selects them.
While self-directed learning of Euclidean halfspaces, linear functions, and
general abstract multi-class hypothesis classes was recently considered, no
results previously existed specifically for self-directed node classification
on graphs. In this paper, we address this problem developing efficient
algorithms for it. More specifically, we focus on the case of (geodesically)
convex clusters, i.e., for every two nodes sharing the same label, all nodes on
every shortest path between them also share the same label. In particular, we
devise a polynomial-time algorithm that makes only $3(h(G)+1)^4 \ln n$ mistakes
on graphs with two convex clusters, where $n$ is the total number of nodes and
$h(G)$ is the Hadwiger number, i.e., the size of the largest clique minor of
the graph $G$. We also show that our algorithm is robust to the case that
clusters are slightly non-convex, still achieving a mistake bound logarithmic
in $n$. Finally, for the more standard case of homophilic clusters, where
strongly connected nodes tend to belong the same class, we devise a simple and
efficient algorithm.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.01428v1,,False
Enhancing Sample Efficiency and Exploration in Reinforcement Learning through the Integration of Diffusion Models and Proximal Policy Optimization,02/09/2024,"Gao Tianci, Dmitriev D.

directly optimizing sequences instead of individual token likelihoods and
evaluate its benefits for fine-tuning large language models. We provide a new

Correlating Time Series with Interpretable Convolutional Kernels,02/09/2024,"Xinyu Chen, HanQin Cai, Fuqiang Liu, Jinhua Zhao","This study addresses the problem of convolutional kernel learning in
univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional time series data, which is
crucial for interpreting temporal patterns in time series and supporting
downstream machine learning tasks. First, we propose formulating convolutional
kernel learning for univariate time series as a sparse regression problem with
a non-negative constraint, leveraging the properties of circular convolution
and circulant matrices. Second, to generalize this approach to multivariate and
multidimensional time series data, we use tensor computations, reformulating
the convolutional kernel learning problem in the form of tensors. This is
further converted into a standard sparse regression problem through
vectorization and tensor unfolding operations. In the proposed methodology, the
optimization problem is addressed using the existing non-negative subspace
pursuit method, enabling the convolutional kernel to capture temporal
correlations and patterns. To evaluate the proposed model, we apply it to
several real-world time series datasets. On the multidimensional rideshare and
taxi trip data from New York City and Chicago, the convolutional kernels reveal
interpretable local correlations and cyclical patterns, such as weekly
seasonality. In the context of multidimensional fluid flow data, both local and
nonlocal correlations captured by the convolutional kernels can reinforce
tensor factorization, leading to performance improvements in fluid flow
reconstruction tasks. Thus, this study lays an insightful foundation for
automatically learning convolutional kernels from time series data, with an

A Financial Time Series Denoiser Based on Diffusion Model,02/09/2024,"Zhuohan Wang, Carmine Ventre","Financial time series often exhibit low signal-to-noise ratio, posing
significant challenges for accurate data interpretation and prediction and
ultimately decision making. Generative models have gained attention as powerful
tools for simulating and predicting intricate data patterns, with the diffusion

novel approach utilizing the diffusion model as a denoiser for financial time

denoised time series significantly enhance the performance on downstream future
return classification tasks. Moreover, trading signals derived from the

Grounding Language Models in Autonomous Loco-manipulation Tasks,02/09/2024,"Jin Wang, Nikos Tsagarakis","Humanoid robots with behavioral autonomy have consistently been regarded as
ideal collaborators in our daily lives and promising representations of

One-Index Vector Quantization Based Adversarial Attack on Image Classification,02/09/2024,"Haiju Fan, Xiaona Qin, Shuang Chen, Hubert P. H. Shum, Ming Li","To improve storage and transmission, images are generally compressed. Vector
quantization (VQ) is a popular compression method as it has a high compression
ratio that suppresses other compression techniques. Despite this, existing
adversarial attack methods on image classification are mostly performed in the
pixel domain with few exceptions in the compressed domain, making them less
applicable in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel one-index
attack method in the VQ domain to generate adversarial images by a differential
evolution algorithm, successfully resulting in image misclassification in
victim models. The one-index attack method modifies a single index in the
compressed data stream so that the decompressed image is misclassified. It only
needs to modify a single VQ index to realize an attack, which limits the number
of perturbed indexes. The proposed method belongs to a semi-black-box attack,
which is more in line with the actual attack scenario. We apply our method to
attack three popular image classification models, i.e., Resnet, NIN, and VGG16.

intermediate token removal, especially under high compression ratios, while
also facing challenges in computational efficiency. In this work, we propose
context-aware prompt compression (CPC), a sentence-level prompt compression
