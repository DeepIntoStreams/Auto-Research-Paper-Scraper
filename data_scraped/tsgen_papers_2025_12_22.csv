RadarGen: Automotive Radar Point Cloud Generation from Cameras,19/12/2025,"Tomer Borreda, Fangqiang Ding, Sanja Fidler, Shengyu Huang, Or Litany","We present RadarGen, a diffusion model for synthesizing realistic automotive radar point clouds from multi-view camera imagery. RadarGen adapts efficient image-latent diffusion to the radar domain by representing radar measurements in bird's-eye-view form that encodes spatial structure together with radar cross section (RCS) and Doppler attributes. A lightweight recovery step reconstructs point clouds from the generated maps. To better align generation with the visual scene, RadarGen incorporates BEV-aligned depth, semantic, and motion cues extracted from pretrained foundation models, which guide the stochastic generation process toward physically plausible radar patterns. Conditioning on images makes the approach broadly compatible, in principle, with existing visual datasets and simulation frameworks, offering a scalable direction for multimodal generative simulation. Evaluations on large-scale driving data show that RadarGen captures characteristic radar measurement distributions and reduces the gap to perception models trained on real data, marking a step toward unified generative simulation across sensing modalities.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17897v1,,False
Learning vertical coordinates via automatic differentiation of a dynamical core,19/12/2025,"Tim Whittaker, Seth Taylor, Elsa Cardoso-Bihlo, Alejandro Di Luca, Alex Bihlo","Terrain-following coordinates in atmospheric models often imprint their grid structure onto the solution, particularly over steep topography, where distorted coordinate layers can generate spurious horizontal and vertical motion. Standard formulations, such as hybrid or SLEVE coordinates, mitigate these errors by using analytic decay functions controlled by heuristic scale parameters that are typically tuned by hand and fixed a priori. In this work, we propose a framework to define a parametric vertical coordinate system as a learnable component within a differentiable dynamical core. We develop an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver for the two-dimensional non-hydrostatic Euler equations on an Arakawa C-grid, and introduce a NEUral Vertical Enhancement (NEUVE) terrain-following coordinate based on an integral transformed neural network that guarantees monotonicity. A key feature of our approach is the use of automatic differentiation to compute exact geometric metric terms, thereby eliminating truncation errors associated with finite-difference coordinate derivatives. By coupling simulation errors through the time integration to the parameterization, our formulation finds a grid structure optimized for both the underlying physics and numerics. Using several standard tests, we demonstrate that these learned coordinates reduce the mean squared error by a factor of 1.4 to 2 in non-linear statistical benchmarks, and eliminate spurious vertical velocity striations over steep topography.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17877v1,,False
AnyTask: an Automated Task and Data Generation Framework for Advancing Sim-to-Real Policy Learning,19/12/2025,"Ran Gong, Xiaohan Zhang, Jinghuan Shang, Maria Vittoria Minniti, Jigarkumar Patel, Valerio Pepe, Riedana Yan, Ahmet Gundogdu, Ivan Kapelyukh, Ali Abbas, Xiaoqiang Yan, Harsh Patel, Laura Herlant, Karl Schmeckpeper","Generalist robot learning remains constrained by data: large-scale, diverse, and high-quality interaction data are expensive to collect in the real world. While simulation has become a promising way for scaling up data collection, the related tasks, including simulation task design, task-aware scene generation, expert demonstration synthesis, and sim-to-real transfer, still demand substantial human effort. We present AnyTask, an automated framework that pairs massively parallel GPU simulation with foundation models to design diverse manipulation tasks and synthesize robot data. We introduce three AnyTask agents for generating expert demonstrations aiming to solve as many tasks as possible: 1) ViPR, a novel task and motion planning agent with VLM-in-the-loop Parallel Refinement; 2) ViPR-Eureka, a reinforcement learning agent with generated dense rewards and LLM-guided contact sampling; 3) ViPR-RL, a hybrid planning and learning approach that jointly produces high-quality demonstrations with only sparse rewards. We train behavior cloning policies on generated data, validate them in simulation, and deploy them directly on real robot hardware. The policies generalize to novel object poses, achieving 44% average success across a suite of real-world pick-and-place, drawer opening, contact-rich pushing, and long-horizon manipulation tasks.

Spatially-informed transformers: Injecting geostatistical covariance biases into self-attention for spatio-temporal forecasting,19/12/2025,Yuri Calleo,"The modeling of high-dimensional spatio-temporal processes presents a fundamental dichotomy between the probabilistic rigor of classical geostatistics and the flexible, high-capacity representations of deep learning. While Gaussian processes offer theoretical consistency and exact uncertainty quantification, their prohibitive computational scaling renders them impractical for massive sensor networks. Conversely, modern transformer architectures excel at sequence modeling but inherently lack a geometric inductive bias, treating spatial sensors as permutation-invariant tokens without a native understanding of distance. In this work, we propose a spatially-informed transformer, a hybrid architecture that injects a geostatistical inductive bias directly into the self-attention mechanism via a learnable covariance kernel. By formally decomposing the attention structure into a stationary physical prior and a non-stationary data-driven residual, we impose a soft topological constraint that favors spatially proximal interactions while retaining the capacity to model complex dynamics. We demonstrate the phenomenon of ``Deep Variography'', where the network successfully recovers the true spatial decay parameters of the underlying process end-to-end via backpropagation. Extensive experiments on synthetic Gaussian random fields and real-world traffic benchmarks confirm that our method outperforms state-of-the-art graph neural networks. Furthermore, rigorous statistical validation confirms that the proposed method delivers not only superior predictive accuracy but also well-calibrated probabilistic forecasts, effectively bridging the gap between physics-aware modeling and data-driven learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17696v1,,False
Fraud detection in credit card transactions using Quantum-Assisted Restricted Boltzmann Machines,19/12/2025,"João Marcos Cavalcanti de Albuquerque Neto, Gustavo Castro do Amaral, Guilherme Penello Temporão","Use cases for emerging quantum computing platforms become economically relevant as the efficiency of processing and availability of quantum computers increase. We assess the performance of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM) assisted by quantum computing, running on real quantum hardware and simulators, using a real dataset containing 145 million transactions provided by Stone, a leading Brazilian fintech, for credit card fraud detection. The results suggest that the quantum-assisted RBM method is able to achieve superior performance in most figures of merit in comparison to classical approaches, even using current noisy quantum annealers. Our study paves the way for implementing quantum-assisted RBMs for general fault detection in financial systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17660v1,,False
Generative Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Scalable Batch Evaluations for Sample-Efficient De Novo Molecular Design,19/12/2025,"Madhav R. Muthyala, Farshud Sorourifar, Tianhong Tan, You Peng, Joel A. Paulson","Designing molecules that must satisfy multiple, often conflicting objectives is a central challenge in molecular discovery. The enormous size of chemical space and the cost of high-fidelity simulations have driven the development of machine learning-guided strategies for accelerating design with limited data. Among these, Bayesian optimization (BO) offers a principled framework for sample-efficient search, while generative models provide a mechanism to propose novel, diverse candidates beyond fixed libraries. However, existing methods that couple the two often rely on continuous latent spaces, which introduces both architectural entanglement and scalability challenges. This work introduces an alternative, modular ""generate-then-optimize"" framework for de novo multi-objective molecular design/discovery. At each iteration, a generative model is used to construct a large, diverse pool of candidate molecules, after which a novel acquisition function, qPMHI (multi-point Probability of Maximum Hypervolume Improvement), is used to optimally select a batch of candidates most likely to induce the largest Pareto front expansion. The key insight is that qPMHI decomposes additively, enabling exact, scalable batch selection via only simple ranking of probabilities that can be easily estimated with Monte Carlo sampling. We benchmark the framework against state-of-the-art latent-space and discrete molecular optimization methods, demonstrating significant improvements across synthetic benchmarks and application-driven tasks. Specifically, in a case study related to sustainable energy storage, we show that our approach quickly uncovers novel, diverse, and high-performing organic (quinone-based) cathode materials for aqueous redox flow battery applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17659v1,,False
Estimating Spatially Resolved Radiation Fields Using Neural Networks,19/12/2025,"Felix Lehner, Pasquale Lombardo, Susana Castillo, Oliver Hupe, Marcus Magnor","We present an in-depth analysis on how to build and train neural networks to estimate the spatial distribution of scattered radiation fields for radiation protection dosimetry in medical radiation fields, such as those found in Interventional Radiology and Cardiology. Therefore, we present three different synthetically generated datasets with increasing complexity for training, using a Monte-Carlo Simulation application based on Geant4. On those datasets, we evaluate convolutional and fully connected architectures of neural networks to demonstrate which design decisions work well for reconstructing the fluence and spectra distributions over the spatial domain of such radiation fields. All used datasets as well as our training pipeline are published as open source in separate repositories.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17654v1,,False
Deep Learning-Based Surrogate Creep Modelling in Inconel 625: A High-Temperature Alloy Study,19/12/2025,"Shubham Das, Kaushal Singhania, Amit Sadhu, Suprabhat Das, Arghya Nandi","Time-dependent deformation, particularly creep, in high-temperature alloys such as Inconel 625 is a key factor in the long-term reliability of components used in aerospace and energy systems. Although Inconel 625 shows excellent creep resistance, finite-element creep simulations in tools such as ANSYS remain computationally expensive, often requiring tens of minutes for a single 10,000-hour run. This work proposes deep learning based surrogate models to provide fast and accurate replacements for such simulations. Creep strain data was generated in ANSYS using the Norton law under uniaxial stresses of 50 to 150 MPa and temperatures of 700 to 1000 $^\circ$C, and this temporal dataset was used to train two architectures: a BiLSTM Variational Autoencoder for uncertainty-aware and generative predictions, and a BiLSTM Transformer hybrid that employs self-attention to capture long-range temporal behavior. Both models act as surrogate predictors, with the BiLSTM-VAE offering probabilistic output and the BiLSTM-Transformer delivering high deterministic accuracy. Performance is evaluated using RMSE, MAE, and $R^2$. Results show that the BiLSTM-VAE provides stable and reliable creep strain forecasts, while the BiLSTM-Transformer achieves strong accuracy across the full time range. Latency tests indicate substantial speedup: while each ANSYS simulation requires 30 to 40 minutes for a given stress-temperature condition, the surrogate models produce predictions within seconds. The proposed framework enables rapid creep assessment for design optimization and structural health monitoring, and provides a scalable solution for high-temperature alloy applications.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17477v1,,False
AdvJudge-Zero: Binary Decision Flips in LLM-as-a-Judge via Adversarial Control Tokens,19/12/2025,"Tung-Ling Li, Yuhao Wu, Hongliang Liu","Reward models and LLM-as-a-Judge systems are central to modern post-training pipelines such as RLHF, DPO, and RLAIF, where they provide scalar feedback and binary decisions that guide model selection and RL-based fine-tuning. We show that these judge systems exhibit a recurring vulnerability: short sequences of low-perplexity control tokens can flip many binary evaluations from correct ``No'' judgments to incorrect ``Yes'' judgments by steering the last-layer logit gap. These control tokens are patterns that a policy model could plausibly generate during post-training, and thus represent realistic reward-hacking risks rather than worst-case adversarial strings. Our method, AdvJudge-Zero, uses the model's next-token distribution and beam-search exploration to discover diverse control-token sequences from scratch, and our analysis shows that the induced hidden-state perturbations concentrate in a low-rank ``soft mode'' that is anti-aligned with the judge's refusal direction. Empirically, these tokens cause very high false positive rates when large open-weight and specialized judge models score incorrect answers on math and reasoning benchmarks. Finally, we show that LoRA-based adversarial training on small sets of control-token-augmented examples can markedly reduce these false positives while preserving evaluation quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17375v1,,False
Penalized Fair Regression for Multiple Groups in Chronic Kidney Disease,19/12/2025,"Carter H. Nakamoto, Lucia Lushi Chen, Agata Foryciarz, Sherri Rose","Fair regression methods have the potential to mitigate societal bias concerns in health care, but there has been little work on penalized fair regression when multiple groups experience such bias. We propose a general regression framework that addresses this gap with unfairness penalties for multiple groups. Our approach is demonstrated for binary outcomes with true positive rate disparity penalties. It can be efficiently implemented through reduction to a cost-sensitive classification problem. We additionally introduce novel score functions for automatically selecting penalty weights. Our penalized fair regression methods are empirically studied in simulations, where they achieve a fairness-accuracy frontier beyond that of existing comparison methods. Finally, we apply these methods to a national multi-site primary care study of chronic kidney disease to develop a fair classifier for end-stage renal disease. There we find substantial improvements in fairness for multiple race and ethnicity groups who experience societal bias in the health care system without any appreciable loss in overall fit.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17340v1,,False
Task Schema and Binding: A Double Dissociation Study of In-Context Learning,19/12/2025,Chaeha Kim,"We provide causal mechanistic validation that in-context learning (ICL) decomposes into two separable mechanisms: Task Schema (abstract task type recognition) and Binding (specific input-output associations). Through activation patching experiments across 9 models from 7 Transformer families plus Mamba (370M-13B parameters), we establish three key findings:
  1. Double dissociation: Task Schema transfers at 100% via late MLP patching; Binding transfers at 62% via residual stream patching -- proving separable mechanisms
  2. Prior-Schema trade-off: Schema reliance inversely correlates with prior knowledge (Spearman rho = -0.596, p < 0.001, N=28 task-model pairs)
  3. Architecture generality: The mechanism operates across all tested architectures including the non-Transformer Mamba
  These findings offer a mechanistic account of the ICL puzzle that contrasts with prior views treating ICL as a monolithic mechanism (whether retrieval-based, gradient descent-like, or purely Bayesian). By establishing that Schema and Binding are neurally dissociable -- not merely behavioral modes -- we provide causal evidence for dual-process theories of ICL. Models rely on Task Schema when prior knowledge is absent, but prior knowledge interferes through attentional mis-routing (72.7% recency bias) rather than direct output competition (0%). This explains why arbitrary mappings succeed (zero prior leads to full Schema reliance) while factual overrides fail -- and reveals that the true bottleneck is attentional, not output-level. Practical implications: Understanding these dual mechanisms enables more efficient prompt engineering -- reliable schema transfer reduces required demonstrations for novel tasks, while prior-aware design can mitigate the 38% binding failure rate in high-prior scenarios, improving ICL system reliability in production deployments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17325v1,,False
Machine Learning Assisted Parameter Tuning on Wavelet Transform Amorphous Radial Distribution Function,19/12/2025,"Deriyan Senjaya, Stephen Ekaputra Limantoro","Understanding atomic structures is crucial, yet amorphous materials remain challenging due to their irregular and non-periodic nature. The wavelet-transform radial distribution function (WT-RDF) offers a physics-based framework for analyzing amorphous structures, reliably predicting the first and second RDF peaks and overall curve trends in both binary Ge 0.25 Se 0.75 and ternary Ag x(Ge 0.25 Se 0.75)100-x (x=5,10,15,20,25) systems. Despite these strengths, WT-RDF shows limitations in amplitude accuracy, which affects quantitative analyses such as coordination numbers. This study addresses the issue by optimizing WT-RDF parameters using a machine learning approach, producing the enhanced WT-RDF+ framework. WT-RDF+ improves the precision of peak predictions and outperforms benchmark ML models, including RBF and LSTM, even when trained on only 25 percent of the binary dataset. These results demonstrate that WT-RDF+ is a robust and reliable model for structural characterization of amorphous materials, particularly Ge-Se systems, and support the efficient design and development of phase-change thin films for next-generation electronic devices and components.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17245v1,,False
Distributed Learning in Markovian Restless Bandits over Interference Graphs for Stable Spectrum Sharing,19/12/2025,"Liad Lea Didi, Kobi Cohen","We study distributed learning for spectrum access and sharing among multiple cognitive communication entities, such as cells, subnetworks, or cognitive radio users (collectively referred to as cells), in communication-constrained wireless networks modeled by interference graphs. Our goal is to achieve a globally stable and interference-aware channel allocation. Stability is defined through a generalized Gale-Shapley multi-to-one matching, a well-established solution concept in wireless resource allocation. We consider wireless networks where L cells share S orthogonal channels and cannot simultaneously use the same channel as their neighbors. Each channel evolves as an unknown restless Markov process with cell-dependent rewards, making this the first work to establish global Gale-Shapley stability for channel allocation in a stochastic, temporally varying restless environment. To address this challenge, we develop SMILE (Stable Multi-matching with Interference-aware LEarning), a communication-efficient distributed learning algorithm that integrates restless bandit learning with graph-constrained coordination. SMILE enables cells to distributedly balance exploration of unknown channels with exploitation of learned information. We prove that SMILE converges to the optimal stable allocation and achieves logarithmic regret relative to a genie with full knowledge of expected utilities. Simulations validate the theoretical guarantees and demonstrate SMILE's robustness, scalability, and efficiency across diverse spectrum-sharing scenarios.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17161v1,,False
SDUM: A Scalable Deep Unrolled Model for Universal MRI Reconstruction,19/12/2025,"Puyang Wang, Pengfei Guo, Keyi Chai, Jinyuan Zhou, Daguang Xu, Shanshan Jiang","Clinical MRI encompasses diverse imaging protocols--spanning anatomical targets (cardiac, brain, knee), contrasts (T1, T2, mapping), sampling patterns (Cartesian, radial, spiral, kt-space), and acceleration factors--yet current deep learning reconstructions are typically protocol-specific, hindering generalization and deployment. We introduce Scalable Deep Unrolled Model (SDUM), a universal framework combining a Restormer-based reconstructor, a learned coil sensitivity map estimator (CSME), sampling-aware weighted data consistency (SWDC), universal conditioning (UC) on cascade index and protocol metadata, and progressive cascade expansion training. SDUM exhibits foundation-model-like scaling behavior: reconstruction quality follows PSNR ${\sim}$ log(parameters) with correlation $r{=}0.986$ ($R^2{=}0.973$) up to 18 cascades, demonstrating predictable performance gains with model depth. A single SDUM trained on heterogeneous data achieves state-of-the-art results across all four CMRxRecon2025 challenge tracks--multi-center, multi-disease, 5T, and pediatric--without task-specific fine-tuning, surpassing specialized baselines by up to ${+}1.0$~dB. On CMRxRecon2024, SDUM outperforms the winning method PromptMR+ by ${+}0.55$~dB; on fastMRI brain, it exceeds PC-RNN by ${+}1.8$~dB. Ablations validate each component: SWDC ${+}0.43$~dB over standard DC, per-cascade CSME ${+}0.51$~dB, UC ${+}0.38$~dB. These results establish SDUM as a practical path toward universal, scalable MRI reconstruction.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.17137v1,,False
