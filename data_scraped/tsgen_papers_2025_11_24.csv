Unmasking Airborne Threats: Guided-Transformers for Portable Aerosol Mass Spectrometry,21/11/2025,"Kyle M. Regan, Michael McLoughlin, Wayne A. Bryden, Gonzalo R. Arce","Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17446v1,,False
Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer: Seq-to-Seq Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup-Delivery Problems,21/11/2025,"Zengyu Zou, Jingyuan Wang, Yixuan Huang, Junjie Wu","This paper addresses the cooperative Multi-Vehicle Dynamic Pickup and Delivery Problem with Stochastic Requests (MVDPDPSR) and proposes an end-to-end centralized decision-making framework based on sequence-to-sequence, named Multi-Agent Pointer Transformer (MAPT). MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17435v1,,False
Selective Rotary Position Embedding,21/11/2025,"Sajad Movahedi, Timur Carstensen, Arshia Afzal, Frank Hutter, Antonio Orvieto, Volkan Cevher","Position information is essential for language modeling. In softmax transformers, Rotary Position Embeddings (\textit{RoPE}) encode positions through \textit{fixed-angle} rotations, while in linear transformers, order is handled via input-dependent (selective) gating that decays past key-value associations. Selectivity has generally been shown to improve language-related tasks. Inspired by this, we introduce \textit{Selective RoPE}, an \textit{input-dependent} rotary embedding mechanism, that generalizes \textit{RoPE}, and enables rotation in \textit{arbitrary angles} for both linear and softmax transformers. We show that softmax attention already performs a hidden form of these rotations on query-key pairs, uncovering an implicit positional structure. We further show that in state-space models and gated linear transformers, the real part manages forgetting while the imaginary part encodes positions through rotations. We validate our method by equipping gated transformers with \textit{Selective RoPE}, demonstrating that its input-dependent rotations improve performance in language modeling and on difficult sequence tasks like copying, state tracking, and retrieval.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17388v1,,False
FORWARD: Dataset of a forwarder operating in rough terrain,21/11/2025,"Mikael Lundbäck, Erik Wallin, Carola Häggström, Mattias Nyström, Andreas Grönlund, Mats Richardson, Petrus Jönsson, William Arnvik, Lucas Hedström, Arvid Fälldin, Martin Servin","We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17318v1,,False
A First Full Physics Benchmark for Highly Granular Calorimeter Surrogates,21/11/2025,"Thorsten Buss, Henry Day-Hall, Frank Gaede, Gregor Kasieczka, Katja Krüger, Anatolii Korol, Thomas Madlener, Peter McKeown","The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17293v1,,False
Leveraging CVAE for Joint Configuration Estimation of Multifingered Grippers from Point Cloud Data,21/11/2025,"Julien Merand, Boris Meden, Mathieu Grossard","This paper presents an efficient approach for determining the joint configuration of a multifingered gripper solely from the point cloud data of its poly-articulated chain, as generated by visual sensors, simulations or even generative neural networks. Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods. This highlights the effectiveness of our pipeline for joint configuration estimation within the broader context of AI-driven techniques for grasp planning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17276v1,10.1109/CASE58245.2025.11164060,False
Range-Edit: Semantic Mask Guided Outdoor LiDAR Scene Editing,21/11/2025,"Suchetan G. Uppur, Hemant Kumar, Vaibhav Kumar","Training autonomous driving and navigation systems requires large and diverse point cloud datasets that capture complex edge case scenarios from various dynamic urban settings. Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17269v1,,False
Learning to Compress: Unlocking the Potential of Large Language Models for Text Representation,21/11/2025,"Yeqin Zhang, Yizheng Zhao, Chen Hu, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Ruihang Miao, Cam-Tu Nguyen","Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17129v1,,False
OmniLens++: Blind Lens Aberration Correction via Large LensLib Pre-Training and Latent PSF Representation,21/11/2025,"Qi Jiang, Xiaolong Qian, Yao Gao, Lei Sun, Kailun Yang, Zhonghua Yi, Wenyong Li, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Luc Van Gool, Kaiwei Wang","Emerging deep-learning-based lens library pre-training (LensLib-PT) pipeline offers a new avenue for blind lens aberration correction by training a universal neural network, demonstrating strong capability in handling diverse unknown optical degradations. This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

Spanning Tree Autoregressive Visual Generation,21/11/2025,"Sangkyu Lee, Changho Lee, Janghoon Han, Hosung Song, Tackgeun You, Hwasup Lim, Stanley Jungkyu Choi, Honglak Lee, Youngjae Yu","We present Spanning Tree Autoregressive (STAR) modeling, which can incorporate prior knowledge of images, such as center bias and locality, to maintain sampling performance while also providing sufficiently flexible sequence orders to accommodate image editing at inference. Approaches that expose randomly permuted sequence orders to conventional autoregressive (AR) models in visual generation for bidirectional context either suffer from a decline in performance or compromise the flexibility in sequence order choice at inference. Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17089v1,,False
Mask the Redundancy: Evolving Masking Representation Learning for Multivariate Time-Series Clustering,21/11/2025,"Zexi Tan, Xiaopeng Luo, Yunlin Liu, Yiqun Zhang","Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17008v1,,False
Generative MIMO Beam Map Construction for Location Recovery and Beam Tracking,21/11/2025,"Wangqian Chen, Junting Chen, Shuguang Cui","Machine learning (ML) has greatly advanced data-driven channel modeling and resource optimization in wireless communication systems. However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.17007v1,,False
MirrorMind: Empowering OmniScientist with the Expert Perspectives and Collective Knowledge of Human Scientists,21/11/2025,"Qingbin Zeng, Bingbing Fan, Zhiyu Chen, Sijian Ren, Zhilun Zhou, Xuhua Zhang, Yuanyi Zhen, Fengli Xu, Yong Li, Tie-Yan Liu","The emergence of AI Scientists has demonstrated remarkable potential in automating scientific research. However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16997v1,,False
RASTP: Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning for Generative Recommendation with Semantic Identifiers,21/11/2025,"Tianyu Zhan, Kairui Fu, Zheqi Lv, Shengyu Zhang","Generative recommendation systems typically leverage Semantic Identifiers (SIDs), which represent each item as a sequence of tokens that encode semantic information. However, representing item ID with multiple SIDs significantly increases input sequence length, which is a major determinant of computational complexity and memory consumption. While existing efforts primarily focus on optimizing attention computation and KV cache, we propose RASTP (Representation-Aware Semantic Token Pruning), which directly prunes less informative tokens in the input sequence. Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN): An End-to-End Direct Probabilistic Framework for Characterizing Hydraulic Conductivities and Quantifying Uncertainty,21/11/2025,"Xun Zhang, Weijie Yang, Jiangjiang Zhang, Simin Jiang","We propose the Diffusion-Inversion-Net (DIN) framework for inverse modeling of groundwater flow and solute transport processes. DIN utilizes an offline-trained Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) as a powerful prior leaner, which flexibly incorporates sparse, multi-source observational data, including hydraulic head, solute concentration, and hard conductivity data, through conditional injection mechanisms. These conditioning inputs subsequently guide the generative inversion process during sampling. Bypassing iterative forward simulations, DIN leverages stochastic sampling and probabilistic modeling mechanisms to directly generate ensembles of posterior parameter fields by repeatedly executing the reverse denoising process. Two representative posterior scenarios, Gaussian and non-Gaussian, are investigated. The results demonstrate that DIN can produce multiple constraint-satisfying realizations under identical observational conditions, accurately estimate hydraulic-conductivity fields, and achieve reliable uncertainty quantification. The framework exhibits strong generalization capability across diverse data distributions, offering a robust and unified alternative to conventional multi-stage inversion methodologies.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16926v1,,False
PepEVOLVE: Position-Aware Dynamic Peptide Optimization via Group-Relative Advantage,21/11/2025,"Trieu Nguyen, Hao-Wei Pang, Shasha Feng","Macrocyclic peptides are an emerging modality that combines biologics-like affinity with small-molecule-like developability, but their vast combinatorial space and multi-parameter objectives make lead optimization slow and challenging. Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints. Overall, PepEVOLVE offers a practical, reproducible path to peptide lead optimization when optimal edit sites are unknown, enabling more efficient exploration and improving design quality across multiple objectives.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16912v1,,False
PersonalizedRouter: Personalized LLM Routing via Graph-based User Preference Modeling,21/11/2025,"Zhongjie Dai, Tao Feng, Jiaxuan You","The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency. Moreover, PersonalizedRouter demonstrates strong few-shot generalization, achieving 64.81% and 85.80% of the fully trained model's performance when adapting to new users and new LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.16883v1,,False
