"LazyDINO: Fast, scalable, and efficiently amortized Bayesian inversion via structure-exploiting and surrogate-driven measure transport",19/11/2024,"Lianghao Cao, Joshua Chen, Michael Brennan, Thomas O'Leary-Roseberry, Youssef Marzouk, Omar Ghattas","We present LazyDINO, a transport map variational inference method for fast,
scalable, and efficiently amortized solutions of high-dimensional nonlinear
Bayesian inverse problems with expensive parameter-to-observable (PtO) maps.
Our method consists of an offline phase in which we construct a
derivative-informed neural surrogate of the PtO map using joint samples of the
PtO map and its Jacobian. During the online phase, when given observational
data, we seek rapid posterior approximation using surrogate-driven training of
a lazy map [Brennan et al., NeurIPS, (2020)], i.e., a structure-exploiting
transport map with low-dimensional nonlinearity. The trained lazy map then
produces approximate posterior samples or density evaluations. Our surrogate
construction is optimized for amortized Bayesian inversion using lazy map
variational inference. We show that (i) the derivative-based reduced basis
architecture [O'Leary-Roseberry et al., Comput. Methods Appl. Mech. Eng., 388
(2022)] minimizes the upper bound on the expected error in surrogate posterior
approximation, and (ii) the derivative-informed training formulation
[O'Leary-Roseberry et al., J. Comput. Phys., 496 (2024)] minimizes the expected
error due to surrogate-driven transport map optimization. Our numerical results
demonstrate that LazyDINO is highly efficient in cost amortization for Bayesian
inversion. We observe one to two orders of magnitude reduction of offline cost
for accurate posterior approximation, compared to simulation-based amortized
inference via conditional transport and conventional surrogate-driven
transport. In particular, LazyDINO outperforms Laplace approximation
consistently using fewer than 1000 offline samples, while other amortized
inference methods struggle and sometimes fail at 16,000 offline samples.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12726v1,,False
Machine Learning Approaches on Crop Pattern Recognition a Comparative Analysis,19/11/2024,"Kazi Hasibul Kabir, Md. Zahiruddin Aqib, Sharmin Sultana, Shamim Akhter","Monitoring agricultural activities is important to ensure food security.
Remote sensing plays a significant role for large-scale continuous monitoring
of cultivation activities. Time series remote sensing data were used for the
generation of the cropping pattern. Classification algorithms are used to
classify crop patterns and mapped agriculture land used. Some conventional
classification methods including support vector machine (SVM) and decision
trees were applied for crop pattern recognition. However, in this paper, we are
proposing Deep Neural Network (DNN) based classification to improve the
performance of crop pattern recognition and make a comparative analysis with
two (2) other machine learning approaches including Naive Bayes and Random
Forest.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12667v1,,False
PoM: Efficient Image and Video Generation with the Polynomial Mixer,19/11/2024,"David Picard, Nicolas Dufour","Diffusion models based on Multi-Head Attention (MHA) have become ubiquitous
to generate high quality images and videos. However, encoding an image or a
video as a sequence of patches results in costly attention patterns, as the
requirements both in terms of memory and compute grow quadratically. To
alleviate this problem, we propose a drop-in replacement for MHA called the
Polynomial Mixer (PoM) that has the benefit of encoding the entire sequence
into an explicit state. PoM has a linear complexity with respect to the number
of tokens. This explicit state also allows us to generate frames in a
sequential fashion, minimizing memory and compute requirement, while still
being able to train in parallel. We show the Polynomial Mixer is a universal
sequence-to-sequence approximator, just like regular MHA. We adapt several
Diffusion Transformers (DiT) for generating images and videos with PoM
replacing MHA, and we obtain high quality samples while using less
computational resources. The code is available at
https://github.com/davidpicard/HoMM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12663v1,,False
Smart Predict-then-Optimize Method with Dependent Data: Risk Bounds and Calibration of Autoregression,19/11/2024,"Jixian Liu, Tao Xu, Jianping He, Chongrong Fang","The predict-then-optimize (PTO) framework is indispensable for addressing
practical stochastic decision-making tasks. It consists of two crucial steps:
initially predicting unknown parameters of an optimization model and
subsequently solving the problem based on these predictions. Elmachtoub and
Grigas [1] introduced the Smart Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss for the
framework, which gauges the decision error arising from predicted parameters,
and a convex surrogate, the SPO+ loss, which incorporates the underlying
structure of the optimization model. The consistency of these different loss
functions is guaranteed under the assumption of i.i.d. training data.
Nevertheless, various types of data are often dependent, such as power load
fluctuations over time. This dependent nature can lead to diminished model
performance in testing or real-world applications. Motivated to make
intelligent predictions for time series data, we present an autoregressive SPO
method directly targeting the optimization problem at the decision stage in
this paper, where the conditions of consistency are no longer met. Therefore,
we first analyze the generalization bounds of the SPO loss within our
autoregressive model. Subsequently, the uniform calibration results in Liu and
Grigas [2] are extended in the proposed model. Finally, we conduct experiments
to empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the SPO+ surrogate compared to
the absolute loss and the least squares loss, especially when the cost vectors
are determined by stationary dynamical systems and demonstrate the relationship
between normalized regret and mixing coefficients.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12653v1,,False
PyAWD: A Library for Generating Large Synthetic Datasets of Acoustic Wave Propagation with Devito,19/11/2024,"Pascal Tribel, Gianluca Bontempi","Seismic data is often sparse and unevenly distributed due to the high costs
and logistical challenges associated with deploying physical seismometers,
limiting the application of Machine Learning (ML) in earthquake analysis. To
address this gap, we introduce PyAWD, a Python library designed to generate
high-resolution synthetic datasets simulating spatio-temporal acoustic wave
propagation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional heterogeneous media.
By allowing fine control over parameters such as wave speed, external forces,
spatial and temporal discretization, and media composition, PyAWD enables the
creation of ML-scale datasets that capture the complexity of seismic wave
behavior. We illustrate the library's potential with an epicenter retrieval
task, showcasing its suitability for designing complex, accurate seismic
problems that support advanced ML approaches in the absence or lack of dense
real-world data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12636v1,,False
Instant Policy: In-Context Imitation Learning via Graph Diffusion,19/11/2024,"Vitalis Vosylius, Edward Johns","Following the impressive capabilities of in-context learning with large
transformers, In-Context Imitation Learning (ICIL) is a promising opportunity
for robotics. We introduce Instant Policy, which learns new tasks instantly
(without further training) from just one or two demonstrations, achieving ICIL
through two key components. First, we introduce inductive biases through a
graph representation and model ICIL as a graph generation problem with a
learned diffusion process, enabling structured reasoning over demonstrations,
observations, and actions. Second, we show that such a model can be trained
using pseudo-demonstrations - arbitrary trajectories generated in simulation -
as a virtually infinite pool of training data. Simulated and real experiments
show that Instant Policy enables rapid learning of various everyday robot
tasks. We also show how it can serve as a foundation for cross-embodiment and
zero-shot transfer to language-defined tasks. Code and videos are available at
https://www.robot-learning.uk/instant-policy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12633v1,,False
STREAM: A Universal State-Space Model for Sparse Geometric Data,19/11/2024,"Mark Sch√∂ne, Yash Bhisikar, Karan Bania, Khaleelulla Khan Nazeer, Christian Mayr, Anand Subramoney, David Kappel","Handling sparse and unstructured geometric data, such as point clouds or
event-based vision, is a pressing challenge in the field of machine vision.
Recently, sequence models such as Transformers and state-space models entered
the domain of geometric data. These methods require specialized preprocessing
to create a sequential view of a set of points. Furthermore, prior works
involving sequence models iterate geometric data with either uniform or learned
step sizes, implicitly relying on the model to infer the underlying geometric
structure. In this work, we propose to encode geometric structure explicitly
into the parameterization of a state-space model. State-space models are based
on linear dynamics governed by a one-dimensional variable such as time or a
spatial coordinate. We exploit this dynamic variable to inject relative
differences of coordinates into the step size of the state-space model. The
resulting geometric operation computes interactions between all pairs of N
points in O(N) steps. Our model deploys the Mamba selective state-space model
with a modified CUDA kernel to efficiently map sparse geometric data to modern
hardware. The resulting sequence model, which we call STREAM, achieves
competitive results on a range of benchmarks from point-cloud classification to
event-based vision and audio classification. STREAM demonstrates a powerful
inductive bias for sparse geometric data by improving the PointMamba baseline
when trained from scratch on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN point cloud
analysis datasets. It further achieves, for the first time, 100% test accuracy
on all 11 classes of the DVS128 Gestures dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12603v1,,False
A data driven approach to classify descriptors based on their efficiency in translating noisy trajectories into physically-relevant information,19/11/2024,"Simone Martino, Domiziano Doria, Chiara Lionello, Matteo Becchi, Giovanni M. Pavan","Reconstructing the physical complexity of many-body dynamical systems can be
challenging. Starting from the trajectories of their constitutive units (raw
data), typical approaches require selecting appropriate descriptors to convert
them into time-series, which are then analyzed to extract interpretable
information. However, identifying the most effective descriptor is often
non-trivial. Here, we report a data-driven approach to compare the efficiency
of various descriptors in extracting information from noisy trajectories and
translating it into physically relevant insights. As a prototypical system with
non-trivial internal complexity, we analyze molecular dynamics trajectories of
an atomistic system where ice and water coexist in equilibrium near the
solid/liquid transition temperature. We compare general and specific
descriptors often used in aqueous systems: number of neighbors, molecular
velocities, Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP), Local Environments and
Neighbors Shuffling (LENS), Orientational Tetrahedral Order, and distance from
the fifth neighbor ($d_5$). Using Onion Clustering -- an efficient unsupervised
method for single-point time-series analysis -- we assess the maximum
extractable information for each descriptor and rank them via a
high-dimensional metric. Our results show that advanced descriptors like SOAP
and LENS outperform classical ones due to higher signal-to-noise ratios.
Nonetheless, even simple descriptors can rival or exceed advanced ones after
local signal denoising. For example, $d_5$, initially among the weakest,
becomes the most effective at resolving the system's non-local dynamical
complexity after denoising. This work highlights the critical role of noise in
information extraction from molecular trajectories and offers a data-driven
approach to identify optimal descriptors for systems with characteristic
internal complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12570v1,,False
Regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs for Distant Label Interactions,19/11/2024,"Sean Papay, Roman Klinger, Sebastian Pado","Linear-chain conditional random fields (CRFs) are a common model component
for sequence labeling tasks when modeling the interactions between different
labels is important. However, the Markov assumption limits linear-chain CRFs to
only directly modeling interactions between adjacent labels. Weighted
finite-state transducers (FSTs) are a related approach which can be made to
model distant label-label interactions, but exact label inference is
intractable for these models in the general case, and the task of selecting an
appropriate automaton structure for the desired interaction types poses a
practical challenge. In this work, we present regular-pattern-sensitive CRFs
(RPCRFs), a method of enriching standard linear-chain CRFs with the ability to
learn long-distance label interactions which occur in user-specified patterns.
This approach allows users to write regular-expression label patterns concisely
specifying which types of interactions the model should take into account,
allowing the model to learn from data whether and in which contexts these
patterns occur. The result can be interpreted alternatively as a CRF augmented
with additional, non-local potentials, or as a finite-state transducer whose
structure is defined by a set of easily-interpretable patterns. Critically,
unlike the general case for FSTs (and for non-chain CRFs), exact training and
inference are tractable for many pattern sets. In this work, we detail how a
RPCRF can be automatically constructed from a set of user-specified patterns,
and demonstrate the model's effectiveness on synthetic data, showing how
different types of patterns can capture different nonlocal dependency
structures in label sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12484v1,,False
"A Review on Generative AI Models for Synthetic Medical Text, Time Series, and Longitudinal Data",19/11/2024,"Mohammad Loni, Fatemeh Poursalim, Mehdi Asadi, Arash Gharehbaghi","This paper presents the results of a novel scoping review on the practical
models for generating three different types of synthetic health records (SHRs):
medical text, time series, and longitudinal data. The innovative aspects of the
review, which incorporate study objectives, data modality, and research
methodology of the reviewed studies, uncover the importance and the scope of
the topic for the digital medicine context. In total, 52 publications met the
eligibility criteria for generating medical time series (22), longitudinal data
(17), and medical text (13). Privacy preservation was found to be the main
research objective of the studied papers, along with class imbalance, data
scarcity, and data imputation as the other objectives. The adversarial
network-based, probabilistic, and large language models exhibited superiority
for generating synthetic longitudinal data, time series, and medical texts,
respectively. Finding a reliable performance measure to quantify SHR
re-identification risk is the major research gap of the topic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12274v1,,False
Contrast Similarity-Aware Dual-Pathway Mamba for Multivariate Time Series Node Classification,19/11/2024,"Mingsen Du, Meng Chen, Yongjian Li, Xiuxin Zhang, Jiahui Gao, Cun Ji, Shoushui Wei","Multivariate time series (MTS) data is generated through multiple sensors
across various domains such as engineering application, health monitoring, and
the internet of things, characterized by its temporal changes and high
dimensional characteristics. Over the past few years, many studies have
explored the long-range dependencies and similarities in MTS. However,
long-range dependencies are difficult to model due to their temporal changes
and high dimensionality makes it difficult to obtain similarities effectively
and efficiently. Thus, to address these issues, we propose contrast
similarity-aware dual-pathway Mamba for MTS node classification (CS-DPMamba).
Firstly, to obtain the dynamic similarity of each sample, we initially use
temporal contrast learning module to acquire MTS representations. And then we
construct a similarity matrix between MTS representations using Fast Dynamic
Time Warping (FastDTW). Secondly, we apply the DPMamba to consider the
bidirectional nature of MTS, allowing us to better capture long-range and
short-range dependencies within the data. Finally, we utilize the
Kolmogorov-Arnold Network enhanced Graph Isomorphism Network to complete the
information interaction in the matrix and MTS node classification task. By
comprehensively considering the long-range dependencies and dynamic similarity
features, we achieved precise MTS node classification. We conducted experiments
on multiple University of East Anglia (UEA) MTS datasets, which encompass
diverse application scenarios. Our results demonstrate the superiority of our
method through both supervised and semi-supervised experiments on the MTS
classification task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.12222v1,,False
HEIGHT: Heterogeneous Interaction Graph Transformer for Robot Navigation in Crowded and Constrained Environments,19/11/2024,"Shuijing Liu, Haochen Xia, Fatemeh Cheraghi Pouria, Kaiwen Hong, Neeloy Chakraborty, Katherine Driggs-Campbell","We study the problem of robot navigation in dense and interactive crowds with
environmental constraints such as corridors and furniture. Previous methods
fail to consider all types of interactions among agents and obstacles, leading
to unsafe and inefficient robot paths. In this article, we leverage a
graph-based representation of crowded and constrained scenarios and propose a
structured framework to learn robot navigation policies with deep reinforcement
learning. We first split the representations of different components in the
environment and propose a heterogeneous spatio-temporal (st) graph to model
distinct interactions among humans, robots, and obstacles. Based on the
heterogeneous st-graph, we propose HEIGHT, a novel navigation policy network
architecture with different components to capture heterogeneous interactions
among entities through space and time. HEIGHT utilizes attention mechanisms to
prioritize important interactions and a recurrent network to track changes in
the dynamic scene over time, encouraging the robot to avoid collisions
adaptively. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that HEIGHT outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in terms of
success and efficiency in challenging navigation scenarios. Furthermore, we
demonstrate that our pipeline achieves better zero-shot generalization
capability than previous works when the densities of humans and obstacles
change. More videos are available at
