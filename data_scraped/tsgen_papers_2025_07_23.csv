Novel Multi-Agent Action Masked Deep Reinforcement Learning for General Industrial Assembly Lines Balancing Problems,22/07/2025,"Ali Mohamed Ali, Luca Tirel, Hashim A. Hashim","Efficient planning of activities is essential for modern industrial assembly
lines to uphold manufacturing standards, prevent project constraint violations,
and achieve cost-effective operations. While exact solutions to such challenges
can be obtained through Integer Programming (IP), the dependence of the search
space on input parameters often makes IP computationally infeasible for
large-scale scenarios. Heuristic methods, such as Genetic Algorithms, can also
be applied, but they frequently produce suboptimal solutions in extensive
cases. This paper introduces a novel mathematical model of a generic industrial
assembly line formulated as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), without imposing
assumptions on the type of assembly line a notable distinction from most
existing models. The proposed model is employed to create a virtual environment
for training Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agents to optimize task and
resource scheduling. To enhance the efficiency of agent training, the paper
proposes two innovative tools. The first is an action-masking technique, which
ensures the agent selects only feasible actions, thereby reducing training
time. The second is a multi-agent approach, where each workstation is managed
by an individual agent, as a result, the state and action spaces were reduced.
A centralized training framework with decentralized execution is adopted,
offering a scalable learning architecture for optimizing industrial assembly
lines. This framework allows the agents to learn offline and subsequently
provide real-time solutions during operations by leveraging a neural network
that maps the current factory state to the optimal action. The effectiveness of
the proposed scheme is validated through numerical simulations, demonstrating
significantly faster convergence to the optimal solution compared to a
comparable model-based approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16635v1,10.1016/j.jai.2025.07.001,False
Data-Driven Adaptive Gradient Recovery for Unstructured Finite Volume Computations,22/07/2025,"G. de Romémont, F. Renac, F. Chinesta, J. Nunez, D. Gueyffier","We present a novel data-driven approach for enhancing gradient reconstruction
in unstructured finite volume methods for hyperbolic conservation laws,
specifically for the 2D Euler equations. Our approach extends previous
structured-grid methodologies to unstructured meshes through a modified
DeepONet architecture that incorporates local geometry in the neural network.
The architecture employs local mesh topology to ensure rotation invariance,
while also ensuring first-order constraint on the learned operator. The
training methodology incorporates physics-informed regularization through
entropy penalization, total variation diminishing penalization, and parameter
regularization to ensure physically consistent solutions, particularly in
shock-dominated regions. The model is trained on high-fidelity datasets
solutions derived from sine waves and randomized piecewise constant initial
conditions with periodic boundary conditions, enabling robust generalization to
complex flow configurations or geometries. Validation test cases from the
literature, including challenging geometry configuration, demonstrates
substantial improvements in accuracy compared to traditional second-order
finite volume schemes. The method achieves gains of 20-60% in solution accuracy
while enhancing computational efficiency. A convergence study has been conveyed
and reveal improved mesh convergence rates compared to the conventional solver.
The proposed algorithm is faster and more accurate than the traditional
second-order finite volume solver, enabling high-fidelity simulations on
coarser grids while preserving the stability and conservation properties
essential for hyperbolic conservation laws. This work is a part of a new
generation of solvers that are built by combining Machine-Learning (ML) tools
with traditional numerical schemes, all while ensuring physical constraint on
the results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16571v1,,False
Alternative Loss Function in Evaluation of Transformer Models,22/07/2025,"Jakub Michańków, Paweł Sakowski, Robert Ślepaczuk","The proper design and architecture of testing of machine learning models,
especially in their application to quantitative finance problems, is crucial.
The most important in this process is selecting an adequate loss function used
for training, validation, estimation purposes, and tuning of hyperparameters.
Therefore, in this research, through empirical experiments on equity and
cryptocurrency assets, we introduce the Mean Absolute Directional Loss (MADL)
function which is more adequate for optimizing forecast-generating models used
in algorithmic investment strategies. The MADL function results are compared
for Transformer and LSTM models and we show that almost in every case
Transformer results are significantly better than those obtained with LSTM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16548v1,,False
ICR Probe: Tracking Hidden State Dynamics for Reliable Hallucination Detection in LLMs,22/07/2025,"Zhenliang Zhang, Xinyu Hu, Huixuan Zhang, Junzhe Zhang, Xiaojun Wan","Large language models (LLMs) excel at various natural language processing
tasks, but their tendency to generate hallucinations undermines their
reliability. Existing hallucination detection methods leveraging hidden states
predominantly focus on static and isolated representations, overlooking their
dynamic evolution across layers, which limits efficacy. To address this
limitation, we shift the focus to the hidden state update process and introduce
a novel metric, the ICR Score (Information Contribution to Residual Stream),
which quantifies the contribution of modules to the hidden states' update. We
empirically validate that the ICR Score is effective and reliable in
distinguishing hallucinations. Building on these insights, we propose a
hallucination detection method, the ICR Probe, which captures the cross-layer
evolution of hidden states. Experimental results show that the ICR Probe
achieves superior performance with significantly fewer parameters. Furthermore,
ablation studies and case analyses offer deeper insights into the underlying
mechanism of this method, improving its interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16488v1,,False
Application of LLM Guided Reinforcement Learning in Formation Control with Collision Avoidance,22/07/2025,"Chenhao Yao, Zike Yuan, Xiaoxu Liu, Chi Zhu","Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) excel at accomplishing complex objectives through
the collaborative efforts of individual agents. Among the methodologies
employed in MAS, Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) stands out as one of
the most efficacious algorithms. However, when confronted with the complex
objective of Formation Control with Collision Avoidance (FCCA): designing an
effective reward function that facilitates swift convergence of the policy
network to an optimal solution. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework
that aims to overcome this challenge. By giving large language models (LLMs) on
the prioritization of tasks and the observable information available to each
agent, our framework generates reward functions that can be dynamically
adjusted online based on evaluation outcomes by employing more advanced
evaluation metrics rather than the rewards themselves. This mechanism enables
the MAS to simultaneously achieve formation control and obstacle avoidance in
dynamic environments with enhanced efficiency, requiring fewer iterations to
reach superior performance levels. Our empirical studies, conducted in both
simulation and real-world settings, validate the practicality and effectiveness
of our proposed approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16382v1,,False
Detect Any Sound: Open-Vocabulary Sound Event Detection with Multi-Modal Queries,22/07/2025,"Pengfei Cai, Yan Song, Qing Gu, Nan Jiang, Haoyu Song, Ian McLoughlin","Most existing sound event detection~(SED) algorithms operate under a
closed-set assumption, restricting their detection capabilities to predefined
classes. While recent efforts have explored language-driven zero-shot SED by
exploiting audio-language models, their performance is still far from
satisfactory due to the lack of fine-grained alignment and cross-modal feature
fusion. In this work, we propose the Detect Any Sound Model (DASM), a
query-based framework for open-vocabulary SED guided by multi-modal queries.
DASM formulates SED as a frame-level retrieval task, where audio features are
matched against query vectors derived from text or audio prompts. To support
this formulation, DASM introduces a dual-stream decoder that explicitly
decouples event recognition and temporal localization: a cross-modality event
decoder performs query-feature fusion and determines the presence of sound
events at the clip-level, while a context network models temporal dependencies
for frame-level localization. Additionally, an inference-time attention masking
strategy is proposed to leverage semantic relations between base and novel
classes, substantially enhancing generalization to novel classes. Experiments
on the AudioSet Strong dataset demonstrate that DASM effectively balances
localization accuracy with generalization to novel classes, outperforming
CLAP-based methods in open-vocabulary setting (+ 7.8 PSDS) and the baseline in
the closed-set setting (+ 6.9 PSDS). Furthermore, in cross-dataset zero-shot
evaluation on DESED, DASM achieves a PSDS1 score of 42.2, even exceeding the
supervised CRNN baseline. The project page is available at

Towards Resilient Safety-driven Unlearning for Diffusion Models against Downstream Fine-tuning,22/07/2025,"Boheng Li, Renjie Gu, Junjie Wang, Leyi Qi, Yiming Li, Run Wang, Zhan Qin, Tianwei Zhang","Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have achieved impressive image
generation quality and are increasingly fine-tuned for personalized
applications. However, these models often inherit unsafe behaviors from toxic
pretraining data, raising growing safety concerns. While recent safety-driven
unlearning methods have made promising progress in suppressing model toxicity,
they are identified to be fragile to downstream fine-tuning, where we reveal
that state-of-the-art methods largely fail to retain their effectiveness even
when fine-tuned on entirely benign datasets. To mitigate this problem, in this
paper, we propose ResAlign, a safety-driven unlearning framework with enhanced
resilience against downstream fine-tuning. By modeling downstream fine-tuning
as an implicit optimization problem with a Moreau Envelope-based reformulation,
ResAlign enables efficient gradient estimation to minimize the recovery of
harmful behaviors. Additionally, a meta-learning strategy is proposed to
simulate a diverse distribution of fine-tuning scenarios to improve
generalization. Extensive experiments across a wide range of datasets,
fine-tuning methods, and configurations demonstrate that ResAlign consistently
outperforms prior unlearning approaches in retaining safety after downstream
fine-tuning while preserving benign generation capability well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16302v1,,False
EBaReT: Expert-guided Bag Reward Transformer for Auto Bidding,22/07/2025,"Kaiyuan Li, Pengyu Wang, Yunshan Peng, Pengjia Yuan, Yanxiang Zeng, Rui Xiang, Yanhua Cheng, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang","Reinforcement learning has been widely applied in automated bidding.
Traditional approaches model bidding as a Markov Decision Process (MDP).
Recently, some studies have explored using generative reinforcement learning
methods to address long-term dependency issues in bidding environments.
Although effective, these methods typically rely on supervised learning
approaches, which are vulnerable to low data quality due to the amount of
sub-optimal bids and low probability rewards resulting from the low click and
conversion rates. Unfortunately, few studies have addressed these challenges.
  In this paper, we formalize the automated bidding as a sequence
decision-making problem and propose a novel Expert-guided Bag Reward
Transformer (EBaReT) to address concerns related to data quality and
uncertainty rewards. Specifically, to tackle data quality issues, we generate a
set of expert trajectories to serve as supplementary data in the training
process and employ a Positive-Unlabeled (PU) learning-based discriminator to
identify expert transitions. To ensure the decision also meets the expert
level, we further design a novel expert-guided inference strategy. Moreover, to
mitigate the uncertainty of rewards, we consider the transitions within a
certain period as a ""bag"" and carefully design a reward function that leads to
a smoother acquisition of rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
model achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art bidding
methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16186v1,,False
SpiroLLM: Finetuning Pretrained LLMs to Understand Spirogram Time Series with Clinical Validation in COPD Reporting,22/07/2025,"Shuhao Mei, Yongchao Long, Shan Cao, Xiaobo Han, Shijia Geng, Jinbo Sun, Yuxi Zhou, Shenda Hong","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a major chronic respiratory
disease with persistent airflow limitation, is a leading global cause of
disability and mortality. Respiratory spirogram time series, routinely
collected during pulmonary function tests (PFTs), play a critical role in the
early detection of repsiratory diseases and in monitoring lung function over
time. However, most current AI models for COPD diagnosis are limited to
outputting classification results without providing a rationale for their
diagnostic process, while current Large Language Models (LLMs) cannot
understand spirograms yet, which severely limits their clinical trust and
adoption. To tackle this challenge, we leverage a cohort of 234,028 individuals
from the UK Biobank (UKB) to propose SpiroLLM, the first multimodal large
language model that can understand spirogram. The model extracts morphological
features from respiratory curves via a SpiroEncoder and aligns them with PFT
numerical values in a unified latent space using a SpiroProjector, ultimately
empowering a large language model to generate a comprehensive diagnostic
report. Experimental results confirm that SpiroLLM achieved a diagnostic AUROC
of 0.8980 (95% CI: 0.8820-0.9132). In a robustness test with missing core data,
it maintained a 100% valid response rate, far surpassing the 13.4% of a
text-only model and showcasing the superiority of its multimodal design. This
work demonstrates the substantial potential of deeply fusing physiological
signals with large language models, establishing a new paradigm for the next
generation of interpretable and reliable clinical decision support tools.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16145v1,,False
Equivariant Goal Conditioned Contrastive Reinforcement Learning,22/07/2025,"Arsh Tangri, Nichols Crawford Taylor, Haojie Huang, Robert Platt","Contrastive Reinforcement Learning (CRL) provides a promising framework for
extracting useful structured representations from unlabeled interactions. By
pulling together state-action pairs and their corresponding future states,
while pushing apart negative pairs, CRL enables learning nontrivial policies
without manually designed rewards. In this work, we propose Equivariant CRL
(ECRL), which further structures the latent space using equivariant
constraints. By leveraging inherent symmetries in goal-conditioned manipulation
tasks, our method improves both sample efficiency and spatial generalization.
Specifically, we formally define Goal-Conditioned Group-Invariant MDPs to
characterize rotation-symmetric robotic manipulation tasks, and build on this
by introducing a novel rotation-invariant critic representation paired with a
rotation-equivariant actor for Contrastive RL. Our approach consistently
outperforms strong baselines across a range of simulated tasks in both
state-based and image-based settings. Finally, we extend our method to the
offline RL setting, demonstrating its effectiveness across multiple tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16139v1,,False
