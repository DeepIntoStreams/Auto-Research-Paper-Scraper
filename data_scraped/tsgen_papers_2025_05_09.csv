Robustly optimal dynamics for active matter reservoir computing,08/05/2025,"Mario U. Gaimann, Miriam Klopotek","We study the information processing abilities of active matter in the
reservoir computing (RC) paradigm, using a model that is externally driven to
infer the future state of a chaotic signal. The simulated system closely
follows a previously reported model. We uncover an exceptional dynamical regime
of agent dynamics that has been overlooked heretofore. It appears robustly
optimal across varying physical parameters and inference tasks, thus providing
valuable insights into computation and inference with physical systems more
generally. The ability to form effective mechanisms for information processing
are primarily determined by the system's own intrinsic relaxation abilities.
These are identifiable when probing the system without a specific inference
goal and manifest when testing minimalistic single-particle reservoirs. The
regime that achieves optimal computation is situated just below the critical
damping threshold, involving a microscopic dynamical relaxation with multiple
stages. The optimal system is adaptable under chaotic external driving, due to
a diversity in response mechanisms that emerge like rapid alternations between
quasi-stationary and highly nonlinear dynamical states. Both coherent and
incoherent dynamics contribute to their operation, partly at dissimilar scales
of space and delay time. Correlations on agent dynamics can indicate the
best-performing regimes and onsets of tight relationships between the
responding system and the fluctuating driver. As this model of computation is
interpretable in physical terms, it facilitates re-framing inquiries regarding
learning and unconventional computing with a fresh rationale for many-body
physics out of equilibrium.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05420v1,,False
Morphologically Symmetric Reinforcement Learning for Ambidextrous Bimanual Manipulation,08/05/2025,"Zechu Li, Yufeng Jin, Daniel Ordonez Apraez, Claudio Semini, Puze Liu, Georgia Chalvatzaki","Humans naturally exhibit bilateral symmetry in their gross manipulation
skills, effortlessly mirroring simple actions between left and right hands.
Bimanual robots-which also feature bilateral symmetry-should similarly exploit
this property to perform tasks with either hand. Unlike humans, who often favor
a dominant hand for fine dexterous skills, robots should ideally execute
ambidextrous manipulation with equal proficiency. To this end, we introduce
SYMDEX (SYMmetric DEXterity), a reinforcement learning framework for
ambidextrous bi-manipulation that leverages the robot's inherent bilateral
symmetry as an inductive bias. SYMDEX decomposes complex bimanual manipulation
tasks into per-hand subtasks and trains dedicated policies for each. By
exploiting bilateral symmetry via equivariant neural networks, experience from
one arm is inherently leveraged by the opposite arm. We then distill the
subtask policies into a global ambidextrous policy that is independent of the
hand-task assignment. We evaluate SYMDEX on six challenging simulated
manipulation tasks and demonstrate successful real-world deployment on two of
them. Our approach strongly outperforms baselines on complex task in which the
left and right hands perform different roles. We further demonstrate SYMDEX's
scalability by extending it to a four-arm manipulation setup, where our
symmetry-aware policies enable effective multi-arm collaboration and
coordination. Our results highlight how structural symmetry as inductive bias
in policy learning enhances sample efficiency, robustness, and generalization
across diverse dexterous manipulation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05287v1,,False
A Two-Sample Test of Text Generation Similarity,08/05/2025,"Jingbin Xu, Chen Qian, Meimei Liu, Feng Guo","The surge in digitized text data requires reliable inferential methods on
observed textual patterns. This article proposes a novel two-sample text test
for comparing similarity between two groups of documents. The hypothesis is
whether the probabilistic mapping generating the textual data is identical
across two groups of documents. The proposed test aims to assess text
similarity by comparing the entropy of the documents. Entropy is estimated
using neural network-based language models. The test statistic is derived from
an estimation-and-inference framework, where the entropy is first approximated
using an estimation set, followed by inference on the remaining data set. We
showed theoretically that under mild conditions, the test statistic
asymptotically follows a normal distribution. A multiple data-splitting
strategy is proposed to enhance test power, which combines p-values into a
unified decision. Various simulation studies and a real data example
demonstrated that the proposed two-sample text test maintains the nominal Type
one error rate while offering greater power compared to existing methods. The
proposed method provides a novel solution to assert differences in document
classes, particularly in fields where large-scale textual information is
crucial.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05269v1,,False
GFlowNets for Active Learning Based Resource Allocation in Next Generation Wireless Networks,08/05/2025,"Charbel Bou Chaaya, Mehdi Bennis","In this work, we consider the radio resource allocation problem in a wireless
system with various integrated functionalities, such as communication, sensing
and computing. We design suitable resource management techniques that can
simultaneously cater to those heterogeneous requirements, and scale
appropriately with the high-dimensional and discrete nature of the problem. We
propose a novel active learning framework where resource allocation patterns
are drawn sequentially, evaluated in the environment, and then used to
iteratively update a surrogate model of the environment. Our method leverages a
generative flow network (GFlowNet) to sample favorable solutions, as such
models are trained to generate compositional objects proportionally to their
training reward, hence providing an appropriate coverage of its modes. As such,
GFlowNet generates diverse and high return resource management designs that
update the surrogate model and swiftly discover suitable solutions. We provide
simulation results showing that our method can allocate radio resources
achieving 20% performance gains against benchmarks, while requiring less than
half of the number of acquisition rounds.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05224v1,,False
Overcoming Dimensional Factorization Limits in Discrete Diffusion Models through Quantum Joint Distribution Learning,08/05/2025,"Chuangtao Chen, Qinglin Zhao, MengChu Zhou, Zhimin He, Haozhen Situ","This study explores quantum-enhanced discrete diffusion models to overcome
classical limitations in learning high-dimensional distributions. We rigorously
prove that classical discrete diffusion models, which calculate per-dimension
transition probabilities to avoid exponential computational cost, exhibit
worst-case linear scaling of Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence with data
dimension. To address this, we propose a Quantum Discrete Denoising Diffusion
Probabilistic Model (QD3PM), which enables joint probability learning through
diffusion and denoising in exponentially large Hilbert spaces. By deriving
posterior states through quantum Bayes' theorem, similar to the crucial role of
posterior probabilities in classical diffusion models, and by learning the
joint probability, we establish a solid theoretical foundation for
quantum-enhanced diffusion models. For denoising, we design a quantum circuit
using temporal information for parameter sharing and learnable
classical-data-controlled rotations for encoding. Exploiting joint distribution
learning, our approach enables single-step sampling from pure noise,
eliminating iterative requirements of existing models. Simulations demonstrate
the proposed model's superior accuracy in modeling complex distributions
compared to factorization methods. Hence, this paper establishes a new
theoretical paradigm in generative models by leveraging the quantum advantage
in joint distribution learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05151v1,,False
Loss-Versus-Rebalancing under Deterministic and Generalized block-times,08/05/2025,"Alex Nezlobin, Martin Tassy","Although modern blockchains almost universally produce blocks at fixed
intervals, existing models still lack an analytical formula for the
loss-versus-rebalancing (LVR) incurred by Automated Market Makers (AMMs)
liquidity providers in this setting. Leveraging tools from random walk theory,
we derive the following closed-form approximation for the per block per unit of
liquidity expected LVR under constant block time:
  \[ \overline{\mathrm{ARB}}= \frac{\,\sigma_b^{2}}
{\,2+\sqrt{2\pi}\,\gamma/(|\zeta(1/2)|\,\sigma_b)\,}+O\!\bigl(e^{-\mathrm{const}\tfrac{\gamma}{\sigma_b}}\bigr)\;\approx\;
\frac{\sigma_b^{2}}{\,2 + 1.7164\,\gamma/\sigma_b}, \] where $\sigma_b$ is the
intra-block asset volatility, $\gamma$ the AMM spread and $\zeta$ the Riemann
Zeta function. Our large Monte Carlo simulations show that this formula is in
fact quasi-exact across practical parameter ranges.
  Extending our analysis to arbitrary block-time distributions as well, we
demonstrate both that--under every admissible inter-block law--the probability
that a block carries an arbitrage trade converges to a universal limit, and
that only constant block spacing attains the asymptotically minimal LVR. This
shows that constant block intervals provide the best possible protection
against arbitrage for liquidity providers. \end{abstract}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05113v1,,False
Enhancing Reinforcement Learning for the Floorplanning of Analog ICs with Beam Search,08/05/2025,"Sandro Junior Della Rovere, Davide Basso, Luca Bortolussi, Mirjana Videnovic-Misic, Husni Habal","The layout of analog ICs requires making complex trade-offs, while addressing
device physics and variability of the circuits. This makes full automation with
learning-based solutions hard to achieve. However, reinforcement learning (RL)
has recently reached significant results, particularly in solving the
floorplanning problem. This paper presents a hybrid method that combines RL
with a beam (BS) strategy. The BS algorithm enhances the agent's inference
process, allowing for the generation of flexible floorplans by accomodating
various objective weightings, and addressing congestion without without the
need for policy retraining or fine-tuning. Moreover, the RL agent's
generalization ability stays intact, along with its efficient handling of
circuit features and constraints. Experimental results show approx. 5-85%
improvement in area, dead space and half-perimeter wire length compared to a
standard RL application, along with higher rewards for the agent. Moreover,
performance and efficiency align closely with those of existing
state-of-the-art techniques.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05059v1,,False
Generative Models for Long Time Series: Approximately Equivariant Recurrent Network Structures for an Adjusted Training Scheme,08/05/2025,"Ruwen Fulek, Markus Lange-Hegermann","We present a simple yet effective generative model for time series data based
on a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with recurrent layers, referred to as the
Recurrent Variational Autoencoder with Subsequent Training (RVAE-ST). Our
method introduces an adapted training scheme that progressively increases the
sequence length, addressing the challenge recurrent layers typically face when
modeling long sequences. By leveraging the recurrent architecture, the model
maintains a constant number of parameters regardless of sequence length. This
design encourages approximate time-shift equivariance and enables efficient
modeling of long-range temporal dependencies. Rather than introducing a
fundamentally new architecture, we show that a carefully composed combination
of known components can match or outperform state-of-the-art generative models
on several benchmark datasets. Our model performs particularly well on time
series that exhibit quasi-periodic structure,while remaining competitive on
datasets with more irregular or partially non-stationary behavior. We evaluate
its performance using ELBO, Fr\'echet Distance, discriminative scores, and
visualizations of the learned embeddings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05020v1,,False
An Agent-Based Modeling Approach to Free-Text Keyboard Dynamics for Continuous Authentication,08/05/2025,"Roberto Dillon, Arushi","Continuous authentication systems leveraging free-text keyboard dynamics
offer a promising additional layer of security in a multifactor authentication
setup that can be used in a transparent way with no impact on user experience.
This study investigates the efficacy of behavioral biometrics by employing an
Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate diverse typing profiles across mechanical
and membrane keyboards. Specifically, we generated synthetic keystroke data
from five unique agents, capturing features related to dwell time, flight time,
and error rates within sliding 5-second windows updated every second. Two
machine learning approaches, One-Class Support Vector Machine (OC-SVM) and
Random Forest (RF), were evaluated for user verification. Results revealed a
stark contrast in performance: while One-Class SVM failed to differentiate
individual users within each group, Random Forest achieved robust
intra-keyboard user recognition (Accuracy > 0.7) but struggled to generalize
across keyboards for the same user, highlighting the significant impact of
keyboard hardware on typing behavior. These findings suggest that: (1)
keyboard-specific user profiles may be necessary for reliable authentication,
and (2) ensemble methods like RF outperform One-Class SVM in capturing
fine-grained user-specific patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.05015v1,,False
Foam-Agent: Towards Automated Intelligent CFD Workflows,08/05/2025,"Ling Yue, Nithin Somasekharan, Yadi Cao, Shaowu Pan","Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is an essential simulation tool in various
engineering disciplines, but it often requires substantial domain expertise and
manual configuration, creating barriers to entry. We present Foam-Agent, a
multi-agent framework that automates complex OpenFOAM-based CFD simulation
workflows from natural language inputs. Our innovation includes (1) a
hierarchical multi-index retrieval system with specialized indices for
different simulation aspects, (2) a dependency-aware file generation system
that provides consistency management across configuration files, and (3) an
iterative error correction mechanism that diagnoses and resolves simulation
failures without human intervention. Through comprehensive evaluation on the
dataset of 110 simulation tasks, Foam-Agent achieves an 83.6% success rate with
Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming existing frameworks (55.5% for
MetaOpenFOAM and 37.3% for OpenFOAM-GPT). Ablation studies demonstrate the
critical contribution of each system component, with the specialized error
correction mechanism providing a 36.4% performance improvement. Foam-Agent
substantially lowers the CFD expertise threshold while maintaining modeling
accuracy, demonstrating the potential of specialized multi-agent systems to
democratize access to complex scientific simulation tools. The code is public

SpatialPrompting: Keyframe-driven Zero-Shot Spatial Reasoning with Off-the-Shelf Multimodal Large Language Models,08/05/2025,"Shun Taguchi, Hideki Deguchi, Takumi Hamazaki, Hiroyuki Sakai","This study introduces SpatialPrompting, a novel framework that harnesses the
emergent reasoning capabilities of off-the-shelf multimodal large language
models to achieve zero-shot spatial reasoning in three-dimensional (3D)
environments. Unlike existing methods that rely on expensive 3D-specific
fine-tuning with specialized 3D inputs such as point clouds or voxel-based
features, SpatialPrompting employs a keyframe-driven prompt generation
strategy. This framework uses metrics such as vision-language similarity,
Mahalanobis distance, field of view, and image sharpness to select a diverse
and informative set of keyframes from image sequences and then integrates them
with corresponding camera pose data to effectively abstract spatial
relationships and infer complex 3D structures. The proposed framework not only
establishes a new paradigm for flexible spatial reasoning that utilizes
intuitive visual and positional cues but also achieves state-of-the-art
zero-shot performance on benchmark datasets, such as ScanQA and SQA3D, across
several metrics. The proposed method effectively eliminates the need for
specialized 3D inputs and fine-tuning, offering a simpler and more scalable
alternative to conventional approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04911v1,,False
Clustering with Communication: A Variational Framework for Single Cell Representation Learning,08/05/2025,"Cong Qi, Yeqing Chen, Jie Zhang, Wei Zhi","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has revealed complex cellular
heterogeneity, but recent studies emphasize that understanding biological
function also requires modeling cell-cell communication (CCC), the signaling
interactions mediated by ligand-receptor pairs that coordinate cellular
behavior. Tools like CellChat have demonstrated that CCC plays a critical role
in processes such as cell differentiation, tissue regeneration, and immune
response, and that transcriptomic data inherently encodes rich information
about intercellular signaling. We propose CCCVAE, a novel variational
autoencoder framework that incorporates CCC signals into single-cell
representation learning. By leveraging a communication-aware kernel derived
from ligand-receptor interactions and a sparse Gaussian process, CCCVAE encodes
biologically informed priors into the latent space. Unlike conventional VAEs
that treat each cell independently, CCCVAE encourages latent embeddings to
reflect both transcriptional similarity and intercellular signaling context.
Empirical results across four scRNA-seq datasets show that CCCVAE improves
clustering performance, achieving higher evaluation scores than standard VAE
baselines. This work demonstrates the value of embedding biological priors into
deep generative models for unsupervised single-cell analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.04891v1,,False
D-CODA: Diffusion for Coordinated Dual-Arm Data Augmentation,08/05/2025,"I-Chun Arthur Liu, Jason Chen, Gaurav Sukhatme, Daniel Seita","Learning bimanual manipulation is challenging due to its high dimensionality
and tight coordination required between two arms. Eye-in-hand imitation
learning, which uses wrist-mounted cameras, simplifies perception by focusing
on task-relevant views. However, collecting diverse demonstrations remains
costly, motivating the need for scalable data augmentation. While prior work
has explored visual augmentation in single-arm settings, extending these
approaches to bimanual manipulation requires generating viewpoint-consistent
observations across both arms and producing corresponding action labels that
are both valid and feasible. In this work, we propose Diffusion for COordinated
Dual-arm Data Augmentation (D-CODA), a method for offline data augmentation
tailored to eye-in-hand bimanual imitation learning that trains a diffusion
model to synthesize novel, viewpoint-consistent wrist-camera images for both
arms while simultaneously generating joint-space action labels. It employs
constrained optimization to ensure that augmented states involving
gripper-to-object contacts adhere to constraints suitable for bimanual
coordination. We evaluate D-CODA on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our
results across 2250 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate
that it outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable
data augmentation in eye-in-hand bimanual manipulation. Our project website is
