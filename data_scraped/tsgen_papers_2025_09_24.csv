MOIS-SAM2: Exemplar-based Segment Anything Model 2 for multilesion interactive segmentation of neurobromas in whole-body MRI,23/09/2025,"Georgii Kolokolnikov, Marie-Lena Schmalhofer, Sophie Götz, Lennart Well, Said Farschtschi, Victor-Felix Mautner, Inka Ristow, Rene Werner","Background and Objectives: Neurofibromatosis type 1 is a genetic disorder
characterized by the development of numerous neurofibromas (NFs) throughout the
body. Whole-body MRI (WB-MRI) is the clinical standard for detection and
longitudinal surveillance of NF tumor growth. Existing interactive segmentation
methods fail to combine high lesion-wise precision with scalability to hundreds
of lesions. This study proposes a novel interactive segmentation model tailored
to this challenge.
  Methods: We introduce MOIS-SAM2, a multi-object interactive segmentation
model that extends the state-of-the-art, transformer-based, promptable Segment
Anything Model 2 (SAM2) with exemplar-based semantic propagation. MOIS-SAM2 was
trained and evaluated on 119 WB-MRI scans from 84 NF1 patients acquired using
T2-weighted fat-suppressed sequences. The dataset was split at the patient
level into a training set and four test sets (one in-domain and three
reflecting different domain shift scenarios, e.g., MRI field strength
variation, low tumor burden, differences in clinical site and scanner vendor).
  Results: On the in-domain test set, MOIS-SAM2 achieved a scan-wise DSC of
0.60 against expert manual annotations, outperforming baseline 3D nnU-Net (DSC:
0.54) and SAM2 (DSC: 0.35). Performance of the proposed model was maintained
under MRI field strength shift (DSC: 0.53) and scanner vendor variation (DSC:
0.50), and improved in low tumor burden cases (DSC: 0.61). Lesion detection F1
scores ranged from 0.62 to 0.78 across test sets. Preliminary inter-reader
variability analysis showed model-to-expert agreement (DSC: 0.62-0.68),
comparable to inter-expert agreement (DSC: 0.57-0.69).
  Conclusions: The proposed MOIS-SAM2 enables efficient and scalable
interactive segmentation of NFs in WB-MRI with minimal user input and strong
generalization, supporting integration into clinical workflows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19277v1,,False
Study Design and Demystification of Physics Informed Neural Networks for Power Flow Simulation,23/09/2025,"Milad Leyli-abadi, Antoine Marot, Jérôme Picault","In the context of the energy transition, with increasing integration of
renewable sources and cross-border electricity exchanges, power grids are
encountering greater uncertainty and operational risk. Maintaining grid
stability under varying conditions is a complex task, and power flow simulators
are commonly used to support operators by evaluating potential actions before
implementation. However, traditional physical solvers, while accurate, are
often too slow for near real-time use. Machine learning models have emerged as
fast surrogates, and to improve their adherence to physical laws (e.g.,
Kirchhoff's laws), they are often trained with embedded constraints which are
also known as physics-informed or hybrid models. This paper presents an
ablation study to demystify hybridization strategies, ranging from
incorporating physical constraints as regularization terms or unsupervised
losses, and exploring model architectures from simple multilayer perceptrons to
advanced graph-based networks enabling the direct optimization of physics
equations. Using our custom benchmarking pipeline for hybrid models called
LIPS, we evaluate these models across four dimensions: accuracy, physical
compliance, industrial readiness, and out-of-distribution generalization. The
results highlight how integrating physical knowledge impacts performance across
these criteria. All the implementations are reproducible and provided in the
corresponding Github page.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19233v1,,False
GSTM-HMU: Generative Spatio-Temporal Modeling for Human Mobility Understanding,23/09/2025,"Wenying Luo, Zhiyuan Lin, Wenhao Xu, Minghao Liu, Zhi Li","Human mobility traces, often recorded as sequences of check-ins, provide a
unique window into both short-term visiting patterns and persistent lifestyle
regularities. In this work we introduce GSTM-HMU, a generative spatio-temporal
framework designed to advance mobility analysis by explicitly modeling the
semantic and temporal complexity of human movement. The framework consists of
four key innovations. First, a Spatio-Temporal Concept Encoder (STCE)
integrates geographic location, POI category semantics, and periodic temporal
rhythms into unified vector representations. Second, a Cognitive Trajectory
Memory (CTM) adaptively filters historical visits, emphasizing recent and
behaviorally salient events in order to capture user intent more effectively.
Third, a Lifestyle Concept Bank (LCB) contributes structured human preference
cues, such as activity types and lifestyle patterns, to enhance
interpretability and personalization. Finally, task-oriented generative heads
transform the learned representations into predictions for multiple downstream
tasks. We conduct extensive experiments on four widely used real-world
datasets, including Gowalla, WeePlace, Brightkite, and FourSquare, and evaluate
performance on three benchmark tasks: next-location prediction, trajectory-user
identification, and time estimation. The results demonstrate consistent and
substantial improvements over strong baselines, confirming the effectiveness of
GSTM-HMU in extracting semantic regularities from complex mobility data. Beyond
raw performance gains, our findings also suggest that generative modeling
provides a promising foundation for building more robust, interpretable, and
generalizable systems for human mobility intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19135v1,,False
PipelineRL: Faster On-policy Reinforcement Learning for Long Sequence Generatio,23/09/2025,"Alexandre Piché, Ehsan Kamaloo, Rafael Pardinas, Dzmitry Bahdanau","Reinforcement Learning (RL) is increasingly utilized to enhance the reasoning
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, effectively scaling
these RL methods presents significant challenges, primarily due to the
difficulty in maintaining high AI accelerator utilization without generating
stale, off-policy data that harms common RL algorithms. This paper introduces
PipelineRL, an approach designed to achieve a superior trade-off between
hardware efficiency and data on-policyness for LLM training. PipelineRL employs
concurrent asynchronous data generation and model training, distinguished by
the novel in-flight weight updates. This mechanism allows the LLM generation
engine to receive updated model weights with minimal interruption during the
generation of token sequences, thereby maximizing both the accelerator
utilization and the freshness of training data. Experiments conducted on
long-form reasoning tasks using 128 H100 GPUs demonstrate that PipelineRL
achieves approximately $\sim 2x$ faster learning compared to conventional RL
baselines while maintaining highly on-policy training data. A scalable and
modular open-source implementation of PipelineRL is also released as a key
contribution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19128v1,,False
Towards Practical Multi-label Causal Discovery in High-Dimensional Event Sequences via One-Shot Graph Aggregation,23/09/2025,"Hugo Math, Rainer Lienhart","Understanding causality in event sequences where outcome labels such as
diseases or system failures arise from preceding events like symptoms or error
codes is critical. Yet remains an unsolved challenge across domains like
healthcare or vehicle diagnostics. We introduce CARGO, a scalable multi-label
causal discovery method for sparse, high-dimensional event sequences comprising
of thousands of unique event types. Using two pretrained causal Transformers as
domain-specific foundation models for event sequences. CARGO infers in
parallel, per sequence one-shot causal graphs and aggregates them using an
adaptive frequency fusion to reconstruct the global Markov boundaries of
labels. This two-stage approach enables efficient probabilistic reasoning at
scale while bypassing the intractable cost of full-dataset conditional
independence testing. Our results on a challenging real-world automotive fault
prediction dataset with over 29,100 unique event types and 474 imbalanced
labels demonstrate CARGO's ability to perform structured reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19112v1,,False
A Fast Initialization Method for Neural Network Controllers: A Case Study of Image-based Visual Servoing Control for the multicopter Interception,23/09/2025,"Chenxu Ke, Congling Tian, Kaichen Xu, Ye Li, Lingcong Bao","Reinforcement learning-based controller design methods often require
substantial data in the initial training phase. Moreover, the training process
tends to exhibit strong randomness and slow convergence. It often requires
considerable time or high computational resources. Another class of
learning-based method incorporates Lyapunov stability theory to obtain a
control policy with stability guarantees. However, these methods generally
require an initially stable neural network control policy at the beginning of
training. Evidently, a stable neural network controller can not only serve as
an initial policy for reinforcement learning, allowing the training to focus on
improving controller performance, but also act as an initial state for
learning-based Lyapunov control methods. Although stable controllers can be
designed using traditional control theory, designers still need to have a great
deal of control design knowledge to address increasingly complicated control
problems. The proposed neural network rapid initialization method in this paper
achieves the initial training of the neural network control policy by
constructing datasets that conform to the stability conditions based on the
system model. Furthermore, using the image-based visual servoing control for
multicopter interception as a case study, simulations and experiments were
conducted to validate the effectiveness and practical performance of the
proposed method. In the experiment, the trained control policy attains a final
interception velocity of 15 m/s.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19110v1,,False
FUNCanon: Learning Pose-Aware Action Primitives via Functional Object Canonicalization for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation,23/09/2025,"Hongli Xu, Lei Zhang, Xiaoyue Hu, Boyang Zhong, Kaixin Bai, Zoltán-Csaba Márton, Zhenshan Bing, Zhaopeng Chen, Alois Christian Knoll, Jianwei Zhang","General-purpose robotic skills from end-to-end demonstrations often leads to
task-specific policies that fail to generalize beyond the training
distribution. Therefore, we introduce FunCanon, a framework that converts
long-horizon manipulation tasks into sequences of action chunks, each defined
by an actor, verb, and object. These chunks focus policy learning on the
actions themselves, rather than isolated tasks, enabling compositionality and
reuse. To make policies pose-aware and category-general, we perform functional
object canonicalization for functional alignment and automatic manipulation
trajectory transfer, mapping objects into shared functional frames using
affordance cues from large vision language models. An object centric and action
centric diffusion policy FuncDiffuser trained on this aligned data naturally
respects object affordances and poses, simplifying learning and improving
generalization ability. Experiments on simulated and real-world benchmarks
demonstrate category-level generalization, cross-task behavior reuse, and
robust sim2real deployment, showing that functional canonicalization provides a
strong inductive bias for scalable imitation learning in complex manipulation
domains. Details of the demo and supplemental material are available on our
project website https://sites.google.com/view/funcanon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19102v1,,False
World4RL: Diffusion World Models for Policy Refinement with Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation,23/09/2025,"Zhennan Jiang, Kai Liu, Yuxin Qin, Shuai Tian, Yupeng Zheng, Mingcai Zhou, Chao Yu, Haoran Li, Dongbin Zhao","Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation
learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage
of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this
limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in
simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative
models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with
diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the
question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance
pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose
World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as
high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined
environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ
world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy
optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a
diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and
refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online
real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme
tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve
modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate
that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables
consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates
compared to imitation learning and other baselines. More visualization results
are available at https://world4rl.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19080v1,,False
Pure Vision Language Action (VLA) Models: A Comprehensive Survey,23/09/2025,"Dapeng Zhang, Jin Sun, Chenghui Hu, Xiaoyan Wu, Zhenlong Yuan, Rui Zhou, Fei Shen, Qingguo Zhou","The emergence of Vision Language Action (VLA) models marks a paradigm shift
from traditional policy-based control to generalized robotics, reframing Vision
Language Models (VLMs) from passive sequence generators into active agents for
manipulation and decision-making in complex, dynamic environments. This survey
delves into advanced VLA methods, aiming to provide a clear taxonomy and a
systematic, comprehensive review of existing research. It presents a
comprehensive analysis of VLA applications across different scenarios and
classifies VLA approaches into several paradigms: autoregression-based,
diffusion-based, reinforcement-based, hybrid, and specialized methods; while
examining their motivations, core strategies, and implementations in detail. In
addition, foundational datasets, benchmarks, and simulation platforms are
introduced. Building on the current VLA landscape, the review further proposes
perspectives on key challenges and future directions to advance research in VLA
models and generalizable robotics. By synthesizing insights from over three
hundred recent studies, this survey maps the contours of this rapidly evolving
field and highlights the opportunities and challenges that will shape the
development of scalable, general-purpose VLA methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.19012v1,,False
Learning From Simulators: A Theory of Simulation-Grounded Learning,23/09/2025,"Carson Dudley, Marisa Eisenberg","Simulation-Grounded Neural Networks (SGNNs) are predictive models trained
entirely on synthetic data from mechanistic simulations. They have achieved
state-of-the-art performance in domains where real-world labels are limited or
unobserved, but lack a formal underpinning.
  We present the foundational theory of simulation-grounded learning. We show
that SGNNs implement amortized Bayesian inference under a simulation prior and
converge to the Bayes-optimal predictor. We derive generalization bounds under
model misspecification and prove that SGNNs can learn unobservable scientific
quantities that empirical methods provably cannot. We also formalize a novel
form of mechanistic interpretability uniquely enabled by SGNNs: by attributing
predictions to the simulated mechanisms that generated them, SGNNs yield
posterior-consistent, scientifically grounded explanations.
  We provide numerical experiments to validate all theoretical predictions.
SGNNs recover latent parameters, remain robust under mismatch, and outperform
classical tools: in a model selection task, SGNNs achieve half the error of AIC
in distinguishing mechanistic dynamics. These results establish SGNNs as a
principled and practical framework for scientific prediction in data-limited
regimes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18990v1,,False
On the Convergence of Policy Mirror Descent with Temporal Difference Evaluation,23/09/2025,"Jiacai Liu, Wenye Li, Ke Wei","Policy mirror descent (PMD) is a general policy optimization framework in
reinforcement learning, which can cover a wide range of typical policy
optimization methods by specifying different mirror maps. Existing analysis of
PMD requires exact or approximate evaluation (for example unbiased estimation
via Monte Carlo simulation) of action values solely based on policy. In this
paper, we consider policy mirror descent with temporal difference evaluation
(TD-PMD). It is shown that, given the access to exact policy evaluations, the
dimension-free $O(1/T)$ sublinear convergence still holds for TD-PMD with any
constant step size and any initialization. In order to achieve this result, new
monotonicity and shift invariance arguments have been developed. The dimension
free $\gamma$-rate linear convergence of TD-PMD is also established provided
the step size is selected adaptively. For the two common instances of TD-PMD
(i.e., TD-PQA and TD-NPG), it is further shown that they enjoy the convergence
in the policy domain. Additionally, we investigate TD-PMD in the inexact
setting and give the sample complexity for it to achieve the last iterate
$\varepsilon$-optimality under a generative model, which improves the last
iterate sample complexity for PMD over the dependence on $1/(1-\gamma)$.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18822v1,,False
Experience Scaling: Post-Deployment Evolution For Large Language Models,23/09/2025,"Xingkun Yin, Kaibin Huang, Dong In Kim, Hongyang Du","Scaling model size, training data, and compute power have driven advances in
large language models (LLMs), but these approaches are reaching saturation as
human-generated text is exhausted and further gains diminish. We propose
experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for
LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative
sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions,
distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored
content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in
simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen
but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores.
Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance
over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results
demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM
capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a
scalable path for continued intelligence progress.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18771v1,,False
Diagonal Linear Networks and the Lasso Regularization Path,23/09/2025,Raphaël Berthier,"Diagonal linear networks are neural networks with linear activation and
diagonal weight matrices. Their theoretical interest is that their implicit
regularization can be rigorously analyzed: from a small initialization, the
training of diagonal linear networks converges to the linear predictor with
minimal 1-norm among minimizers of the training loss. In this paper, we deepen
this analysis showing that the full training trajectory of diagonal linear
networks is closely related to the lasso regularization path. In this
connection, the training time plays the role of an inverse regularization
parameter. Both rigorous results and simulations are provided to illustrate
this conclusion. Under a monotonicity assumption on the lasso regularization
path, the connection is exact while in the general case, we show an approximate
connection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18766v1,,False
COLT: Enhancing Video Large Language Models with Continual Tool Usage,23/09/2025,"Yuyang Liu, Xinyuan Shi, Bang Yang, Peilin Zhou, Jiahua Dong, Long Chen, Ian Reid, Xiaondan Liang","The success of Large Language Models (LLMs) has significantly propelled the
research of video understanding. To harvest the benefits of well-trained expert
models (i.e., tools), video LLMs prioritize the exploration of tool usage
capabilities. Existing methods either prompt closed-source LLMs or employ the
instruction tuning paradigm for tool-use fine-tuning. These methods, however,
assume an established repository of fixed tools and struggle to generalize to
real-world environments where tool data is perpetually evolving and streaming
in. To this end, we propose to enhance open-source video LLMs with COntinuaL
Tool usage (termed COLT), which automatically acquires tool-use ability in a
successive tool stream without suffering 'catastrophic forgetting' of the past
learned tools. Specifically, our COLT incorporates a learnable tool codebook as
a tool-specific memory system. Then relevant tools are dynamically selected
based on the similarity between user instruction and tool features within the
codebook. To unleash the tool usage potential of video LLMs, we collect a
video-centric tool-use instruction tuning dataset VideoToolBench. Extensive
experiments on both previous video LLM benchmarks and the tool-use-specific
VideoToolBench dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our
proposed COLT.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18754v1,,False
MOMEMTO: Patch-based Memory Gate Model in Time Series Foundation Model,23/09/2025,"Samuel Yoon, Jongwon Kim, Juyoung Ha, Young Myoung Ko","Recently reconstruction-based deep models have been widely used for time
series anomaly detection, but as their capacity and representation capability
increase, these models tend to over-generalize, often reconstructing unseen
anomalies accurately. Prior works have attempted to mitigate this by
incorporating a memory architecture that stores prototypes of normal patterns.
Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from high training costs and have yet to
be effectively integrated with time series foundation models (TFMs). To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{MOMEMTO}, a TFM for anomaly detection,
enhanced with a patch-based memory module to mitigate over-generalization. The
memory module is designed to capture representative normal patterns from
multiple domains and enables a single model to be jointly fine-tuned across
multiple datasets through a multi-domain training strategy. MOMEMTO initializes
memory items with latent representations from a pre-trained encoder, organizes
them into patch-level units, and updates them via an attention mechanism. We
evaluate our method using 23 univariate benchmark datasets. Experimental
results demonstrate that MOMEMTO, as a single model, achieves higher scores on
AUC and VUS metrics compared to baseline methods, and further enhances the
performance of its backbone TFM, particularly in few-shot learning scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18751v1,,False
Consistency of Selection Strategies for Fraud Detection,23/09/2025,"Christos Revelas, Otilia Boldea, Bas J. M. Werker","This paper studies how insurers can chose which claims to investigate for
fraud. Given a prediction model, typically only claims with the highest
predicted propability of being fraudulent are investigated. We argue that this
can lead to inconsistent learning and propose a randomized alternative. More
generally, we draw a parallel with the multi-arm bandit literature and argue
that, in the presence of selection, the obtained observations are not iid.
Hence, dependence on past observations should be accounted for when updating
parameter estimates. We formalize selection in a binary regression framework
and show that model updating and maximum-likelihood estimation can be
implemented as if claims were investigated at random. Then, we define
consistency of selection strategies and conjecture sufficient conditions for
consistency. Our simulations suggest that the often-used selection strategy can
be inconsistent while the proposed randomized alternative is consistent.
Finally, we compare our randomized selection strategy with Thompson sampling, a
standard multi-arm bandit heuristic. Our simulations suggest that the latter
can be inefficient in learning low fraud probabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18739v1,,False
An overview of neural architectures for self-supervised audio representation learning from masked spectrograms,23/09/2025,"Sarthak Yadav, Sergios Theodoridis, Zheng-Hua Tan","In recent years, self-supervised learning has amassed significant interest
for training deep neural representations without labeled data. One such
self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the
objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by
predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the
Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has
emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio
representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the
issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled
Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence
length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches.
Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and
extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches
which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two
topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview
encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked
spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling
architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and
xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on
ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested

Generalizable Domain Adaptation for Sim-and-Real Policy Co-Training,23/09/2025,"Shuo Cheng, Liqian Ma, Zhenyang Chen, Ajay Mandlekar, Caelan Garrett, Danfei Xu","Behavior cloning has shown promise for robot manipulation, but real-world
demonstrations are costly to acquire at scale. While simulated data offers a
scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration
generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various
simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified
sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation
policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world
demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant,
task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint
distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains
provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We
achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the
co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle
the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples.
We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can
leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the
real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in
simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18631v1,,False
DS-Diffusion: Data Style-Guided Diffusion Model for Time-Series Generation,23/09/2025,"Mingchun Sun, Rongqiang Zhao, Jie Liu","Diffusion models are the mainstream approach for time series generation
tasks. However, existing diffusion models for time series generation require
retraining the entire framework to introduce specific conditional guidance.
There also exists a certain degree of distributional bias between the generated
data and the real data, which leads to potential model biases in downstream
tasks. Additionally, the complexity of diffusion models and the latent spaces
leads to an uninterpretable inference process. To address these issues, we
propose the data style-guided diffusion model (DS-Diffusion). In the
DS-Diffusion, a diffusion framework based on style-guided kernels is developed
to avoid retraining for specific conditions. The time-information based
hierarchical denoising mechanism (THD) is developed to reduce the
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data. Furthermore,
the generated samples can clearly indicate the data style from which they
originate. We conduct comprehensive evaluations using multiple public datasets
to validate our approach. Experimental results show that, compared to the
state-of-the-art model such as ImagenTime, the predictive score and the
discriminative score decrease by 5.56% and 61.55%, respectively. The
distributional bias between the generated data and the real data is further
reduced, the inference process is also more interpretable. Moreover, by
eliminating the need to retrain the diffusion model, the flexibility and
adaptability of the model to specific conditions are also enhanced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.18584v1,,False
