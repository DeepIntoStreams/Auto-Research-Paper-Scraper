On Uncertainty Calibration for Equivariant Functions,24/10/2025,"Edward Berman, Jacob Ginesin, Marco Pacini, Robin Walters","Data-sparse settings such as robotic manipulation, molecular physics, and
galaxy morphology classification are some of the hardest domains for deep
learning. For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling
across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can
guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between
equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model
calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and
regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is
natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the
relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we
present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving
lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under
various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of
equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in
miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our
theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship
between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated
datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21691v1,,False
DeepAgent: A General Reasoning Agent with Scalable Toolsets,24/10/2025,"Xiaoxi Li, Wenxiang Jiao, Jiarui Jin, Guanting Dong, Jiajie Jin, Yinuo Wang, Hao Wang, Yutao Zhu, Ji-Rong Wen, Yuan Lu, Zhicheng Dou","Large reasoning models have demonstrated strong problem-solving abilities,
yet real-world tasks often require external tools and long-horizon
interactions. Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows,
which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce
DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous
thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent
reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions,
particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the
accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding
mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working,
and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical
information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we
develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that
leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to
assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments
on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank,
TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA,
HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both
labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios. This work takes a step
toward more general and capable agents for real-world applications. The code

Generative Correlation Manifolds: Generating Synthetic Data with Preserved Higher-Order Correlations,24/10/2025,"Jens E. d'Hondt, Wieger R. Punter, Odysseas Papapetrou","The increasing need for data privacy and the demand for robust machine
learning models have fueled the development of synthetic data generation
techniques. However, current methods often succeed in replicating simple
summary statistics but fail to preserve both the pairwise and higher-order
correlation structure of the data that define the complex, multi-variable
interactions inherent in real-world systems. This limitation can lead to
synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for
sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative
Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating
synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target
correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve
the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to
higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset. We argue that this method
provides a new approach to synthetic data generation with potential
applications in privacy-preserving data sharing, robust model training, and
simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21610v1,,False
Generalised Flow Maps for Few-Step Generative Modelling on Riemannian Manifolds,24/10/2025,"Oscar Davis, Michael S. Albergo, Nicholas M. Boffi, Michael M. Bronstein, Avishek Joey Bose","Geometric data and purpose-built generative models on them have become
ubiquitous in high-impact deep learning application domains, ranging from
protein backbone generation and computational chemistry to geospatial data.
Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at
inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they
are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and
flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised
Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the
Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We
instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods:
Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and
Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under
specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step
generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows,
to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative
models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion
angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality
for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive
log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21608v1,,False
SHAP Meets Tensor Networks: Provably Tractable Explanations with Parallelism,24/10/2025,"Reda Marzouk, Shahaf Bassan, Guy Katz","Although Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) can be computed in polynomial
time for simple models like decision trees, they unfortunately become NP-hard
to compute for more expressive black-box models like neural networks - where
generating explanations is often most critical. In this work, we analyze the
problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader
and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP
algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network
abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for
computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary
structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor
Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic*
time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs,
this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such
as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore
tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models.
Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor
Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become
*efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains
computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important
insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the
primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21599v1,,False
Learning Neural Control Barrier Functions from Expert Demonstrations using Inverse Constraint Learning,24/10/2025,"Yuxuan Yang, Hussein Sibai","Safety is a fundamental requirement for autonomous systems operating in
critical domains. Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design
safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to
maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven
alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis.
However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be
avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in
autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task
and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a
constraint function that classifies the states of the system under
consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that
is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to
the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of
simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our
approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms
existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained
with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21560v1,,False
ParaRNN: Unlocking Parallel Training of Nonlinear RNNs for Large Language Models,24/10/2025,"Federico Danieli, Pau Rodriguez, Miguel Sarabia, Xavier Suau, Luca Zappella","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) laid the foundation for sequence modeling,
but their intrinsic sequential nature restricts parallel computation, creating
a fundamental barrier to scaling. This has led to the dominance of
parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space
Models (SSMs). While SSMs achieve efficient parallelization through structured
linear recurrences, this linearity constraint limits their expressive power and
precludes modeling complex, nonlinear sequence-wise dependencies. To address
this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization
barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of
nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we
solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel
reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive
sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented
scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU
architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain
perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures.
To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN
codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of
nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear
RNN models at scale.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21450v1,,False
Unified token representations for sequential decision models,24/10/2025,"Zhuojing Tian, Yushu Chen","Transformers have demonstrated strong potential in offline reinforcement
learning (RL) by modeling trajectories as sequences of return-to-go, states,
and actions. However, existing approaches such as the Decision Transformer(DT)
and its variants suffer from redundant tokenization and quadratic attention
complexity, limiting their scalability in real-time or resource-constrained
settings. To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that
merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially
reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that
UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved
generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon
transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower
computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across
architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in

PhysWorld: From Real Videos to World Models of Deformable Objects via Physics-Aware Demonstration Synthesis,24/10/2025,"Yu Yang, Zhilu Zhang, Xiang Zhang, Yihan Zeng, Hui Li, Wangmeng Zuo","Interactive world models that simulate object dynamics are crucial for
robotics, VR, and AR. However, it remains a significant challenge to learn
physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data,
especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties.
To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel
framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and
diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first
construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via
constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical
properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical
properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin,
synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these
demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded
with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the
physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions
for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel

Randomized Neural Network with Adaptive Forward Regularization for Online Task-free Class Incremental Learning,24/10/2025,"Junda Wang, Minghui Hu, Ning Li, Abdulaziz Al-Ali, Ponnuthurai Nagaratnam Suganthan","Class incremental learning (CIL) requires an agent to learn distinct tasks
consecutively with knowledge retention against forgetting. Problems impeding
the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch
streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online
task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in
learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient
decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a
randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is
proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general
framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization,
has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R)
in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep
random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward
regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention.
edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable
learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting
while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties
caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve
it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple
sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning.
Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic
performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the
efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21367v1,,False
Patient-specific AI for generation of 3D dosimetry imaging from two 2D-planar measurements,24/10/2025,"Alejandro Lopez-Montes, Robert Seifert, Astrid Delker, Guido Boening, Jiahui Wang, Christoph Clement, Ali Afshar-Oromieh, Axel Rominger, Kuangyu Shi","In this work we explored the use of patient specific reinforced learning to
generate 3D activity maps from two 2D planar images (anterior and posterior).
The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional
methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine
where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as
177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT
acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate
3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry
applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point
dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific
dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the
anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use
of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D
planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar
acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement
learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ
delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with
patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for
simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an
hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of
paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using
only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT

CausalRec: A CausalBoost Attention Model for Sequential Recommendation,24/10/2025,"Yunbo Hou, Tianle Yang, Ruijie Li, Li He, Liang Wang, Weiping Li, Bo Zheng, Guojie Song","Recent advances in correlation-based sequential recommendation systems have
demonstrated substantial success. Specifically, the attention-based model
outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both
short- and long-term dependencies more effectively. However, solely focusing on
item co-occurrences overlooks the underlying motivations behind user behaviors,
leading to spurious correlations and potentially inaccurate recommendations. To
address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal
attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal
discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the
causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee
the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the
discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing
behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world
datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods,
with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized
Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the
first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in
sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating
more accurate and reliable recommendations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21333v1,,False
Unified Implementations of Recurrent Neural Networks in Multiple Deep Learning Frameworks,24/10/2025,Francesco Martinuzzi,"Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are a cornerstone of sequence modeling

On the flow matching interpretability,24/10/2025,"Francesco Pivi, Simone Gazza, Davide Evangelista, Roberto Amadini, Maurizio Gabbrielli","Generative models based on flow matching have demonstrated remarkable success
in various domains, yet they suffer from a fundamental limitation: the lack of
interpretability in their intermediate generation steps. In fact these models
learn to transform noise into data through a series of vector field updates,
however the meaning of each step remains opaque. We address this problem by
proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a
known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained
to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We
implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow
steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule.
  Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising
configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that
performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete
Ising states while preserving physical constraints.
  We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it
preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed
as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each
vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising
model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into
generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable
physical processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.21210v1,,False
Shylock: Causal Discovery in Multivariate Time Series based on Hybrid Constraints,24/10/2025,"Shuo Li, Keqin Xu, Jie Liu, Dan Ye","Causal relationship discovery has been drawing increasing attention due to
its prevalent application. Existing methods rely on human experience,
statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck
at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is
also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many
areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods
are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in
this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both
few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the
number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a
sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time
delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock
achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To
evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to
generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and

String Seed of Thought: Prompting LLMs for Distribution-Faithful and Diverse Generation,24/10/2025,"Kou Misaki, Takuya Akiba","We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs
that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a
task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options,
each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical
distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when
prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic
answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications
requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation,
content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of
generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the
outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose
SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random
string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract
randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby
preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate
