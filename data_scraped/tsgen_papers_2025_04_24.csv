Latent Diffusion Planning for Imitation Learning,23/04/2025,"Amber Xie, Oleh Rybkin, Dorsa Sadigh, Chelsea Finn","Recent progress in imitation learning has been enabled by policy
architectures that scale to complex visuomotor tasks, multimodal distributions,
and large datasets. However, these methods often rely on learning from large
amount of expert demonstrations. To address these shortcomings, we propose
Latent Diffusion Planning (LDP), a modular approach consisting of a planner
which can leverage action-free demonstrations, and an inverse dynamics model
which can leverage suboptimal data, that both operate over a learned latent
space. First, we learn a compact latent space through a variational
autoencoder, enabling effective forecasting of future states in image-based
domains. Then, we train a planner and an inverse dynamics model with diffusion
objectives. By separating planning from action prediction, LDP can benefit from
the denser supervision signals of suboptimal and action-free data. On simulated
visual robotic manipulation tasks, LDP outperforms state-of-the-art imitation
learning approaches, as they cannot leverage such additional data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16925v1,,False
Generalized Neighborhood Attention: Multi-dimensional Sparse Attention at the Speed of Light,23/04/2025,"Ali Hassani, Fengzhe Zhou, Aditya Kane, Jiannan Huang, Chieh-Yun Chen, Min Shi, Steven Walton, Markus Hoehnerbach, Vijay Thakkar, Michael Isaev, Qinsheng Zhang, Bing Xu, Haicheng Wu, Wen-mei Hwu, Ming-Yu Liu, Humphrey Shi","Many sparse attention mechanisms such as Neighborhood Attention have
typically failed to consistently deliver speedup over the self attention
baseline. This is largely due to the level of complexity in attention
infrastructure, and the rapid evolution of AI hardware architecture. At the
same time, many state-of-the-art foundational models, particularly in computer
vision, are heavily bound by attention, and need reliable sparsity to escape
the O(n^2) complexity. In this paper, we study a class of promising sparse
attention mechanisms that focus on locality, and aim to develop a better
analytical model of their performance improvements. We first introduce
Generalized Neighborhood Attention (GNA), which can describe sliding window,
strided sliding window, and blocked attention. We then consider possible design
choices in implementing these approaches, and create a simulator that can
provide much more realistic speedup upper bounds for any given setting.
Finally, we implement GNA on top of a state-of-the-art fused multi-headed
attention (FMHA) kernel designed for the NVIDIA Blackwell architecture in
CUTLASS. Our implementation can fully realize the maximum speedup theoretically
possible in many perfectly block-sparse cases, and achieves an effective
utilization of 1.3 petaFLOPs/second in FP16. In addition, we plug various GNA
configurations into off-the-shelf generative models, such as Cosmos-7B,
HunyuanVideo, and FLUX, and show that it can deliver 28% to 46% end-to-end
speedup on B200 without any fine-tuning. We will open source our simulator and
Blackwell kernels directly through the NATTEN project.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16922v1,,False
Exploring zero-shot structure-based protein fitness prediction,23/04/2025,"Arnav Sharma, Anthony Gitter","The ability to make zero-shot predictions about the fitness consequences of
protein sequence changes with pre-trained machine learning models enables many
practical applications. Such models can be applied for downstream tasks like
genetic variant interpretation and protein engineering without additional
labeled data. The advent of capable protein structure prediction tools has led
to the availability of orders of magnitude more precomputed predicted
structures, giving rise to powerful structure-based fitness prediction models.
Through our experiments, we assess several modeling choices for structure-based
models and their effects on downstream fitness prediction. Zero-shot fitness
prediction models can struggle to assess the fitness landscape within
disordered regions of proteins, those that lack a fixed 3D structure. We
confirm the importance of matching protein structures to fitness assays and
find that predicted structures for disordered regions can be misleading and
affect predictive performance. Lastly, we evaluate an additional
structure-based model on the ProteinGym substitution benchmark and show that
simple multi-modal ensembles are strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16886v1,,False
Random Long-Context Access for Mamba via Hardware-aligned Hierarchical Sparse Attention,23/04/2025,"Xiang Hu, Jiaqi Leng, Jun Zhao, Kewei Tu, Wei Wu","A key advantage of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) over Transformers is
their linear computational and space complexity enables faster training and
inference for long sequences. However, RNNs are fundamentally unable to
randomly access historical context, and simply integrating attention mechanisms
may undermine their efficiency advantages. To overcome this limitation, we
propose \textbf{H}ierarchical \textbf{S}parse \textbf{A}ttention (HSA), a novel
attention mechanism that enhances RNNs with long-range random access
flexibility while preserving their merits in efficiency and length
generalization. HSA divides inputs into chunks, selecting the top-$k$ chunks
and hierarchically aggregates information. The core innovation lies in learning
token-to-chunk relevance based on fine-grained token-level information inside
each chunk. This approach enhances the precision of chunk selection across both
in-domain and out-of-domain context lengths. To make HSA efficient, we further
introduce a hardware-aligned kernel design. By combining HSA with Mamba, we
introduce RAMba, which achieves perfect accuracy in passkey retrieval across 64
million contexts despite pre-training on only 4K-length contexts, and
significant improvements on various downstream tasks, with nearly constant
memory footprint. These results show RAMba's huge potential in long-context
modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16795v1,,False
Online model learning with data-assimilated reservoir computers,23/04/2025,"Andrea Nóvoa, Luca Magri","We propose an online learning framework for forecasting nonlinear
spatio-temporal signals (fields). The method integrates (i) dimensionality
reduction, here, a simple proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) projection;
(ii) a generalized autoregressive model to forecast reduced dynamics, here, a
reservoir computer; (iii) online adaptation to update the reservoir computer
(the model), here, ensemble sequential data assimilation.We demonstrate the
framework on a wake past a cylinder governed by the Navier-Stokes equations,
exploring the assimilation of full flow fields (projected onto POD modes) and
sparse sensors. Three scenarios are examined: a na\""ive physical state
estimation; a two-fold estimation of physical and reservoir states; and a
three-fold estimation that also adjusts the model parameters. The two-fold
strategy significantly improves ensemble convergence and reduces reconstruction
error compared to the na\""ive approach. The three-fold approach enables robust
online training of partially-trained reservoir computers, overcoming
limitations of a priori training. By unifying data-driven reduced order
modelling with Bayesian data assimilation, this work opens new opportunities
for scalable online model learning for nonlinear time series forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16767v1,,False
MOSAIC: A Skill-Centric Algorithmic Framework for Long-Horizon Manipulation Planning,23/04/2025,"Itamar Mishani, Yorai Shaoul, Maxim Likhachev","Planning long-horizon motions using a set of predefined skills is a key
challenge in robotics and AI. Addressing this challenge requires methods that
systematically explore skill combinations to uncover task-solving sequences,
harness generic, easy-to-learn skills (e.g., pushing, grasping) to generalize
across unseen tasks, and bypass reliance on symbolic world representations that
demand extensive domain and task-specific knowledge. Despite significant
progress, these elements remain largely disjoint in existing approaches,
leaving a critical gap in achieving robust, scalable solutions for complex,
long-horizon problems. In this work, we present MOSAIC, a skill-centric
framework that unifies these elements by using the skills themselves to guide
the planning process. MOSAIC uses two families of skills: Generators compute
executable trajectories and world configurations, and Connectors link these
independently generated skill trajectories by solving boundary value problems,
enabling progress toward completing the overall task. By breaking away from the
conventional paradigm of incrementally discovering skills from predefined start
or goal states--a limitation that significantly restricts exploration--MOSAIC
focuses planning efforts on regions where skills are inherently effective. We
demonstrate the efficacy of MOSAIC in both simulated and real-world robotic
manipulation tasks, showcasing its ability to solve complex long-horizon
planning problems using a diverse set of skills incorporating generative
diffusion models, motion planning algorithms, and manipulation-specific models.

PIN-WM: Learning Physics-INformed World Models for Non-Prehensile Manipulation,23/04/2025,"Wenxuan Li, Hang Zhao, Zhiyuan Yu, Yu Du, Qin Zou, Ruizhen Hu, Kai Xu","While non-prehensile manipulation (e.g., controlled pushing/poking)
constitutes a foundational robotic skill, its learning remains challenging due
to the high sensitivity to complex physical interactions involving friction and
restitution. To achieve robust policy learning and generalization, we opt to
learn a world model of the 3D rigid body dynamics involved in non-prehensile
manipulations and use it for model-based reinforcement learning. We propose
PIN-WM, a Physics-INformed World Model that enables efficient end-to-end
identification of a 3D rigid body dynamical system from visual observations.
Adopting differentiable physics simulation, PIN-WM can be learned with only
few-shot and task-agnostic physical interaction trajectories. Further, PIN-WM
is learned with observational loss induced by Gaussian Splatting without
needing state estimation. To bridge Sim2Real gaps, we turn the learned PIN-WM
into a group of Digital Cousins via physics-aware randomizations which perturb
physics and rendering parameters to generate diverse and meaningful variations
of the PIN-WM. Extensive evaluations on both simulation and real-world tests
demonstrate that PIN-WM, enhanced with physics-aware digital cousins,
facilitates learning robust non-prehensile manipulation skills with Sim2Real
transfer, surpassing the Real2Sim2Real state-of-the-arts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16693v1,,False
Offline Robotic World Model: Learning Robotic Policies without a Physics Simulator,23/04/2025,"Chenhao Li, Andreas Krause, Marco Hutter","Reinforcement Learning (RL) has demonstrated impressive capabilities in
robotic control but remains challenging due to high sample complexity, safety
concerns, and the sim-to-real gap. While offline RL eliminates the need for
risky real-world exploration by learning from pre-collected data, it suffers
from distributional shift, limiting policy generalization. Model-Based RL
(MBRL) addresses this by leveraging predictive models for synthetic rollouts,
yet existing approaches often lack robust uncertainty estimation, leading to
compounding errors in offline settings. We introduce Offline Robotic World
Model (RWM-O), a model-based approach that explicitly estimates epistemic
uncertainty to improve policy learning without reliance on a physics simulator.
By integrating these uncertainty estimates into policy optimization, our
approach penalizes unreliable transitions, reducing overfitting to model errors
and enhancing stability. Experimental results show that RWM-O improves
generalization and safety, enabling policy learning purely from real-world data
and advancing scalable, data-efficient RL for robotics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16680v1,,False
HERB: Human-augmented Efficient Reinforcement learning for Bin-packing,23/04/2025,"Gojko Perovic, Nuno Ferreira Duarte, Atabak Dehban, Gonçalo Teixeira, Egidio Falotico, José Santos-Victor","Packing objects efficiently is a fundamental problem in logistics, warehouse
automation, and robotics. While traditional packing solutions focus on
geometric optimization, packing irregular, 3D objects presents significant
challenges due to variations in shape and stability. Reinforcement
Learning~(RL) has gained popularity in robotic packing tasks, but training
purely from simulation can be inefficient and computationally expensive. In
this work, we propose HERB, a human-augmented RL framework for packing
irregular objects. We first leverage human demonstrations to learn the best
sequence of objects to pack, incorporating latent factors such as space
optimization, stability, and object relationships that are difficult to model
explicitly. Next, we train a placement algorithm that uses visual information
to determine the optimal object positioning inside a packing container. Our
approach is validated through extensive performance evaluations, analyzing both
packing efficiency and latency. Finally, we demonstrate the real-world
feasibility of our method on a robotic system. Experimental results show that
our method outperforms geometric and purely RL-based approaches by leveraging
human intuition, improving both packing robustness and adaptability. This work
highlights the potential of combining human expertise-driven RL to tackle
complex real-world packing challenges in robotic systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16595v1,,False
Confidence Sequences for Generalized Linear Models via Regret Analysis,23/04/2025,"Eugenio Clerico, Hamish Flynn, Wojciech Kotłowski, Gergely Neu","We develop a methodology for constructing confidence sets for parameters of
statistical models via a reduction to sequential prediction. Our key
observation is that for any generalized linear model (GLM), one can construct
an associated game of sequential probability assignment such that achieving low
regret in the game implies a high-probability upper bound on the excess
likelihood of the true parameter of the GLM. This allows us to develop a scheme
that we call online-to-confidence-set conversions, which effectively reduces
the problem of proving the desired statistical claim to an algorithmic
question. We study two varieties of this conversion scheme: 1) analytical
conversions that only require proving the existence of algorithms with low
regret and provide confidence sets centered at the maximum-likelihood estimator
2) algorithmic conversions that actively leverage the output of the online
algorithm to construct confidence sets (and may be centered at other,
adaptively constructed point estimators). The resulting methodology recovers
all state-of-the-art confidence set constructions within a single framework,
and also provides several new types of confidence sets that were previously
unknown in the literature.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16555v1,,False
Modern Computational Methods in Reinsurance Optimization: From Simulated Annealing to Quantum Branch & Bound,23/04/2025,"George Woodman, Ruben S. Andrist, Thomas Häner, Damien S. Steiger, Martin J. A. Schuetz, Helmut G. Katzgraber, Marcin Detyniecki","We propose and implement modern computational methods to enhance catastrophe
excess-of-loss reinsurance contracts in practice. The underlying optimization
problem involves attachment points, limits, and reinstatement clauses, and the
objective is to maximize the expected profit while considering risk measures
and regulatory constraints. We study the problem formulation, paving the way
for practitioners, for two very different approaches: A local search optimizer
using simulated annealing, which handles realistic constraints, and a branch &
bound approach exploring the potential of a future speedup via quantum branch &
bound. On the one hand, local search effectively generates contract structures
within several constraints, proving useful for complex treaties that have
multiple local optima. On the other hand, although our branch & bound
formulation only confirms that solving the full problem with a future quantum
computer would require a stronger, less expensive bound and substantial
hardware improvements, we believe that the designed application-specific bound
is sufficiently strong to serve as a basis for further works. Concisely, we
provide insurance practitioners with a robust numerical framework for contract
optimization that handles realistic constraints today, as well as an outlook
and initial steps towards an approach which could leverage quantum computers in
the future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16530v1,,False
The Dance of Atoms-De Novo Protein Design with Diffusion Model,23/04/2025,"Yujie Qin, Ming He, Changyong Yu, Ming Ni, Xian Liu, Xiaochen Bo","The de novo design of proteins refers to creating proteins with specific
structures and functions that do not naturally exist. In recent years, the
accumulation of high-quality protein structure and sequence data and
technological advancements have paved the way for the successful application of
generative artificial intelligence (AI) models in protein design. These models
have surpassed traditional approaches that rely on fragments and
bioinformatics. They have significantly enhanced the success rate of de novo
protein design, and reduced experimental costs, leading to breakthroughs in the
field. Among various generative AI models, diffusion models have yielded the
most promising results in protein design. In the past two to three years, more
than ten protein design models based on diffusion models have emerged. Among
them, the representative model, RFDiffusion, has demonstrated success rates in
25 protein design tasks that far exceed those of traditional methods, and other
AI-based approaches like RFjoint and hallucination. This review will
systematically examine the application of diffusion models in generating
protein backbones and sequences. We will explore the strengths and limitations
of different models, summarize successful cases of protein design using
diffusion models, and discuss future development directions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16479v1,,False
Node Assigned physics-informed neural networks for thermal-hydraulic system simulation: CVH/FL module,23/04/2025,"Jeesuk Shin, Cheolwoong Kim, Sunwoong Yang, Minseo Lee, Sung Joong Kim, Joongoo Jeon","Severe accidents (SAs) in nuclear power plants have been analyzed using
thermal-hydraulic (TH) system codes such as MELCOR and MAAP. These codes
efficiently simulate the progression of SAs, while they still have inherent
limitations due to their inconsistent finite difference schemes. The use of
empirical schemes incorporating both implicit and explicit formulations
inherently induces unidirectional coupling in multi-physics analyses. The
objective of this study is to develop a novel numerical method for TH system
codes using physics-informed neural network (PINN). They have shown strength in
solving multi-physics due to the innate feature of neural networks-automatic
differentiation. We propose a node-assigned PINN (NA-PINN) that is suitable for
the control volume approach-based system codes. NA-PINN addresses the issue of
spatial governing equation variation by assigning an individual network to each
nodalization of the system code, such that spatial information is excluded from
both the input and output domains, and each subnetwork learns to approximate a
purely temporal solution. In this phase, we evaluated the accuracy of the PINN
methods for the hydrodynamic module. In the 6 water tank simulation, PINN and
NA-PINN showed maximum absolute errors of 1.678 and 0.007, respectively. It
should be noted that only NA-PINN demonstrated acceptable accuracy. To the best
of the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to successfully implement a
system code using PINN. Our future work involves extending NA-PINN to a
multi-physics solver and developing it in a surrogate manner.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16447v1,,False
Towards a fast and robust deep hedging approach,23/04/2025,"Fabienne Schmid, Daniel Oeltz","We present a robust Deep Hedging framework for the pricing and hedging of
option portfolios that significantly improves training efficiency and model
robustness. In particular, we propose a neural model for training model
embeddings which utilizes the paths of several advanced equity option models
with stochastic volatility in order to learn the relationships that exist
between hedging strategies. A key advantage of the proposed method is its
ability to rapidly and reliably adapt to new market regimes through the
recalibration of a low-dimensional embedding vector, rather than retraining the
entire network. Moreover, we examine the observed Profit and Loss distributions
on the parameter space of the models used to learn the embeddings. The results
show that the proposed framework works well with data generated by complex
models and can serve as a construction basis for an efficient and robust
simulation tool for the systematic development of an entirely model-independent
hedging strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16436v1,,False
iTFKAN: Interpretable Time Series Forecasting with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,23/04/2025,"Ziran Liang, Rui An, Wenqi Fan, Yanghui Rao, Yuxuan Liang","As time evolves, data within specific domains exhibit predictability that
motivates time series forecasting to predict future trends from historical
data. However, current deep forecasting methods can achieve promising
performance but generally lack interpretability, hindering trustworthiness and
practical deployment in safety-critical applications such as auto-driving and
healthcare. In this paper, we propose a novel interpretable model, iTFKAN, for
credible time series forecasting. iTFKAN enables further exploration of model
decision rationales and underlying data patterns due to its interpretability
achieved through model symbolization. Besides, iTFKAN develops two strategies,
prior knowledge injection, and time-frequency synergy learning, to effectively
guide model learning under complex intertwined time series data. Extensive
experimental results demonstrated that iTFKAN can achieve promising forecasting
performance while simultaneously possessing high interpretive capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16432v1,,False
PINN-MEP: Continuous Neural Representations for Minimum-Energy Path Discovery in Molecular Systems,23/04/2025,"Magnus Petersen, Roberto Covino","Characterizing conformational transitions in physical systems remains a
fundamental challenge in the computational sciences. Traditional sampling
methods like molecular dynamics (MD) or MCMC often struggle with the
high-dimensional nature of molecular systems and the high energy barriers of
transitions between stable states. While these transitions are rare events in
simulation timescales, they often represent the most biologically significant
processes - for example, the conformational change of an ion channel protein
from its closed to open state, which controls cellular ion flow and is crucial
for neural signaling. Such transitions in real systems may take milliseconds to
seconds but could require months or years of continuous simulation to observe
even once. We present a method that reformulates transition path generation as
a continuous optimization problem solved through physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs) inspired by string methods for minimum-energy path (MEP)
generation. By representing transition paths as implicit neural functions and
leveraging automatic differentiation with differentiable molecular dynamics
force fields, our method enables the efficient discovery of physically
realistic transition pathways without requiring expensive path sampling. We
demonstrate our method's effectiveness on two proteins, including an explicitly
hydrated bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) system with over 8,300

Unbiased simulation of Asian options,23/04/2025,"Bruno Bouchard, Xiaolu Tan","We provide an extension of the unbiased simulation method for SDEs developed

a continuous function with bounded variations. In particular, this applies to
the numerical resolution of the class of path-dependent PDEs whose regularity,
in the sens of Dupire, is studied in Bouchard and Tan [Ann. I.H.P., to appear].",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16349v1,,False
