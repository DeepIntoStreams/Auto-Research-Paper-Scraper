TMLC-Net: Transferable Meta Label Correction for Noisy Label Learning,11/02/2025,Mengyang Li,"The prevalence of noisy labels in real-world datasets poses a significant
impediment to the effective deployment of deep learning models. While
meta-learning strategies have emerged as a promising approach for addressing
this challenge, existing methods often suffer from limited transferability and
task-specific designs. This paper introduces TMLC-Net, a novel Transferable
Meta-Learner for Correcting Noisy Labels, designed to overcome these
limitations. TMLC-Net learns a general-purpose label correction strategy that
can be readily applied across diverse datasets and model architectures without
requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Our approach integrates three
core components: (1) Normalized Noise Perception, which captures and normalizes
training dynamics to handle distribution shifts; (2) Time-Series Encoding,
which models the temporal evolution of sample statistics using a recurrent
neural network; and (3) Subclass Decoding, which predicts a corrected label
distribution based on the learned representations. We conduct extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets with various noise types and levels,
demonstrating that TMLC-Net consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in terms of both accuracy and robustness to label noise. Furthermore, we
analyze the transferability of TMLC-Net, showcasing its adaptability to new
datasets and noise conditions, and establishing its potential as a broadly
applicable solution for robust deep learning in noisy environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07721v1,,False
Near-Optimal Sample Complexity in Reward-Free Kernel-Based Reinforcement Learning,11/02/2025,"Aya Kayal, Sattar Vakili, Laura Toni, Alberto Bernacchia","Reinforcement Learning (RL) problems are being considered under increasingly
more complex structures. While tabular and linear models have been thoroughly
explored, the analytical study of RL under nonlinear function approximation,
especially kernel-based models, has recently gained traction for their strong
representational capacity and theoretical tractability. In this context, we
examine the question of statistical efficiency in kernel-based RL within the
reward-free RL framework, specifically asking: how many samples are required to
design a near-optimal policy? Existing work addresses this question under
restrictive assumptions about the class of kernel functions. We first explore
this question by assuming a generative model, then relax this assumption at the
cost of increasing the sample complexity by a factor of H, the length of the
episode. We tackle this fundamental problem using a broad class of kernels and
a simpler algorithm compared to prior work. Our approach derives new confidence
intervals for kernel ridge regression, specific to our RL setting, which may be
of broader applicability. We further validate our theoretical findings through
simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07715v1,,False
Distributional Instrumental Variable Method,11/02/2025,"Anastasiia Holovchak, Sorawit Saengkyongam, Nicolai Meinshausen, Xinwei Shen","The instrumental variable (IV) approach is commonly used to infer causal
effects in the presence of unmeasured confounding. Conventional IV models
commonly make the additive noise assumption, which is hard to ensure in
practice, but also typically lack flexibility if the causal effects are
complex. Further, the vast majority of the existing methods aims to estimate
the mean causal effects only, a few other methods focus on the quantile
effects. This work aims for estimation of the entire interventional
distribution. We propose a novel method called distributional instrumental
variables (DIV), which leverages generative modelling in a nonlinear
instrumental variable setting. We establish identifiability of the
interventional distribution under general assumptions and demonstrate an
`under-identified' case where DIV can identify the causal effects while
two-step least squares fails to. Our empirical results show that the DIV method
performs well for a broad range of simulated data, exhibiting advantages over
existing IV approaches in terms of the identifiability and estimation error of
the mean or quantile treatment effects. Furthermore, we apply DIV to an
economic data set to examine the causal relation between institutional quality
and economic development and our results that closely align with the original
study. We also apply DIV to a single-cell data set, where we study the
generalizability and stability in predicting gene expression under unseen
interventions. The software implementations of DIV are available in R and
Python.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07641v1,,False
Beyond Prompting: Time2Lang -- Bridging Time-Series Foundation Models and Large Language Models for Health Sensing,11/02/2025,"Arvind Pillai, Dimitris Spathis, Subigya Nepal, Amanda C Collins, Daniel M Mackin, Michael V Heinz, Tess Z Griffin, Nicholas C Jacobson, Andrew Campbell","Large language models (LLMs) show promise for health applications when
combined with behavioral sensing data. Traditional approaches convert sensor
data into text prompts, but this process is prone to errors, computationally
expensive, and requires domain expertise. These challenges are particularly
acute when processing extended time series data. While time series foundation
models (TFMs) have recently emerged as powerful tools for learning
representations from temporal data, bridging TFMs and LLMs remains challenging.
Here, we present Time2Lang, a framework that directly maps TFM outputs to LLM
representations without intermediate text conversion. Our approach first trains
on synthetic data using periodicity prediction as a pretext task, followed by
evaluation on mental health classification tasks. We validate Time2Lang on two
longitudinal wearable and mobile sensing datasets: daily depression prediction
using step count data (17,251 days from 256 participants) and flourishing
classification based on conversation duration (46 participants over 10 weeks).
Time2Lang maintains near constant inference times regardless of input length,
unlike traditional prompting methods. The generated embeddings preserve
essential time-series characteristics such as auto-correlation. Our results
demonstrate that TFMs and LLMs can be effectively integrated while minimizing
information loss and enabling performance transfer across these distinct
modeling paradigms. To our knowledge, we are the first to integrate a TFM and
an LLM for health, thus establishing a foundation for future research combining
general-purpose large models for complex healthcare tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07608v1,,False
Generative Modeling with Bayesian Sample Inference,11/02/2025,"Marten Lienen, Marcel Kollovieh, Stephan GÃ¼nnemann","We derive a novel generative model from the simple act of Gaussian posterior
inference. Treating the generated sample as an unknown variable to infer lets
us formulate the sampling process in the language of Bayesian probability. Our
model uses a sequence of prediction and posterior update steps to narrow down
the unknown sample from a broad initial belief. In addition to a rigorous
theoretical analysis, we establish a connection between our model and diffusion
models and show that it includes Bayesian Flow Networks (BFNs) as a special
case. In our experiments, we demonstrate improved performance over both BFNs
and Variational Diffusion Models, achieving competitive likelihood scores on
CIFAR10 and ImageNet.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07580v1,,False
LASP-2: Rethinking Sequence Parallelism for Linear Attention and Its Hybrid,11/02/2025,"Weigao Sun, Disen Lan, Yiran Zhong, Xiaoye Qu, Yu Cheng","Linear sequence modeling approaches, such as linear attention, provide
advantages like linear-time training and constant-memory inference over
sequence lengths. However, existing sequence parallelism (SP) methods are
either not optimized for the right-product-first feature of linear attention or
use a ring-style communication strategy, which results in lower computation
parallelism, limits their scalability for longer sequences in distributed
systems. In this paper, we introduce LASP-2, a new SP method to enhance both
communication and computation parallelism when training linear attention
transformer models with very-long input sequences. Compared to previous work
LASP, LASP-2 rethinks the minimal communication requirement for SP on linear
attention layers, reorganizes the whole communication-computation workflow of
LASP. In this way, only one single AllGather collective communication is needed
on intermediate memory states, whose sizes are independent of the sequence
length, leading to significant improvements of both communication and
computation parallelism, as well as their overlap. Additionally, we extend
LASP-2 to LASP-2H by applying similar communication redesign to standard
attention modules, offering an efficient SP solution for hybrid models that
blend linear and standard attention layers. Our evaluation on a Linear-Llama3
model, a variant of Llama3 with linear attention replacing standard attention,
demonstrates the effectiveness of LASP-2 and LASP-2H. Specifically, LASP-2
achieves training speed improvements of 15.2% over LASP and 36.6% over Ring
Attention, with a sequence length of 2048K across 64 GPUs. The Code is released

Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm,11/02/2025,"Helem Salinas, Rafael Brahm, Greg Olmschenk, Richard K. Barry, Karim Pichara, Stela Ishitani Silva, Vladimir Araujo","The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large
fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data
that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals.
Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify
transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and
validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for
the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we
propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for
phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those
observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new
neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image
(FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally
developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated
significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous
approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ
multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from
the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series,
without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn
characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps
distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model
successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122
multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from
TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius > 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating
its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07542v1,,False
Forecasting the future development in quality and value of professional football players for applications in team management,11/02/2025,"Koen W. van Arem, Floris Goes-Smit, Jakob SÃ¶hl","Transfers in professional football (soccer) are risky investments because of
the large transfer fees and high risks involved. Although data-driven models
can be used to improve transfer decisions, existing models focus on describing
players' historical progress, leaving their future performance unknown.
Moreover, recent developments have called for the use of explainable models
combined with uncertainty quantification of predictions. This paper assesses
explainable machine learning models based on predictive accuracy and
uncertainty quantification methods for the prediction of the future development
in quality and transfer value of professional football players. Using a
historical data set of data-driven indicators describing player quality and the
transfer value of a football player, the models are trained to forecast player
quality and player value one year ahead. These two prediction problems
demonstrate the efficacy of tree-based models, particularly random forest and
XGBoost, in making accurate predictions. In general, the random forest model is
found to be the most suitable model because it provides accurate predictions as
well as an uncertainty quantification method that naturally arises from the
bagging procedure of the random forest model. Additionally, our research shows
that the development of player performance contains nonlinear patterns and
interactions between variables, and that time series information can provide
useful information for the modeling of player performance metrics. Our research
provides models to help football clubs make more informed, data-driven transfer
decisions by forecasting player quality and transfer value.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07528v1,,False

artificial intelligence, significantly enhancing how machines comprehend and
generate human languages. Inspired by the success of these foundation models,
researchers have developed foundation models for individual scientific domains,
including small molecules, materials, proteins, DNA, and RNA. However, these
models are typically trained in isolation, lacking the ability to integrate
across different scientific domains. Recognizing that entities within these
domains can all be represented as sequences, which together form the ""language
of nature"", we introduce Nature Language Model (briefly, NatureLM), a
sequence-based science foundation model designed for scientific discovery.
Pre-trained with data from multiple scientific domains, NatureLM offers a
unified, versatile model that enables various applications including: (i)
generating and optimizing small molecules, proteins, RNA, and materials using
text instructions; (ii) cross-domain generation/design, such as
protein-to-molecule and protein-to-RNA generation; and (iii) achieving

URECA: The Chain of Two Minimum Set Cover Problems exists behind Adaptation to Shifts in Semantic Code Search,11/02/2025,"Seok-Ung Choi, Joonghyuk Hahn, Yo-Sub Han","Adaptation is to make model learn the patterns shifted from the training
distribution. In general, this adaptation is formulated as the minimum entropy
problem. However, the minimum entropy problem has inherent limitation --
shifted initialization cascade phenomenon. We extend the relationship between
the minimum entropy problem and the minimum set cover problem via Lebesgue
integral. This extension reveals that internal mechanism of the minimum entropy
problem ignores the relationship between disentangled representations, which
leads to shifted initialization cascade. From the analysis, we introduce a new
clustering algorithm, Union-find based Recursive Clustering Algorithm~(URECA).
URECA is an efficient clustering algorithm for the leverage of the
relationships between disentangled representations. The update rule of URECA
depends on Thresholdly-Updatable Stationary Assumption to dynamics as a
released version of Stationary Assumption. This assumption helps URECA to
transport disentangled representations with no errors based on the
relationships between disentangled representations. URECA also utilize
simulation trick to efficiently cluster disentangled representations. The wide
range of evaluations show that URECA achieves consistent performance gains for
the few-shot adaptation to diverse types of shifts along with advancement to

Physiome-ODE: A Benchmark for Irregularly Sampled Multivariate Time Series Forecasting Based on Biological ODEs,11/02/2025,"Christian KlÃ¶tergens, Vijaya Krishna Yalavarthi, Randolf Scholz, Maximilian Stubbemann, Stefan Born, Lars Schmidt-Thieme","State-of-the-art methods for forecasting irregularly sampled time series with
missing values predominantly rely on just four datasets and a few small toy
examples for evaluation. While ordinary differential equations (ODE) are the
prevalent models in science and engineering, a baseline model that forecasts a
constant value outperforms ODE-based models from the last five years on three
of these existing datasets. This unintuitive finding hampers further research
on ODE-based models, a more plausible model family. In this paper, we develop a
methodology to generate irregularly sampled multivariate time series (IMTS)
datasets from ordinary differential equations and to select challenging
instances via rejection sampling. Using this methodology, we create
Physiome-ODE, a large and sophisticated benchmark of IMTS datasets consisting
of 50 individual datasets, derived from real-world ordinary differential
equations from research in biology. Physiome-ODE is the first benchmark for
IMTS forecasting that we are aware of and an order of magnitude larger than the
current evaluation setting of four datasets. Using our benchmark Physiome-ODE,
we show qualitatively completely different results than those derived from the
current four datasets: on Physiome-ODE ODE-based models can play to their
strength and our benchmark can differentiate in a meaningful way between
different IMTS forecasting models. This way, we expect to give a new impulse to
research on ODE-based time series modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07489v1,,False
5D Neural Surrogates for Nonlinear Gyrokinetic Simulations of Plasma Turbulence,11/02/2025,"Gianluca Galletti, Fabian Paischer, Paul Setinek, William Hornsby, Lorenzo Zanisi, Naomi Carey, Stanislas Pamela, Johannes Brandstetter","Nuclear fusion plays a pivotal role in the quest for reliable and sustainable
energy production. A major roadblock to achieving commercially viable fusion
power is understanding plasma turbulence, which can significantly degrade
plasma confinement. Modelling turbulence is crucial to design performing plasma
scenarios for next-generation reactor-class devices and current experimental
machines. The nonlinear gyrokinetic equation underpinning turbulence modelling
evolves a 5D distribution function over time. Solving this equation numerically
is extremely expensive, requiring up to weeks for a single run to converge,
making it unfeasible for iterative optimisation and control studies. In this
work, we propose a method for training neural surrogates for 5D gyrokinetic
simulations. Our method extends a hierarchical vision transformer to five
dimensions and is trained on the 5D distribution function for the adiabatic
electron approximation. We demonstrate that our model can accurately infer
downstream physical quantities such as heat flux time trace and electrostatic
potentials for single-step predictions two orders of magnitude faster than
numerical codes. Our work paves the way towards neural surrogates for plasma
turbulence simulations to accelerate deployment of commercial energy production

TRAVEL: Training-Free Retrieval and Alignment for Vision-and-Language Navigation,11/02/2025,"Navid Rajabi, Jana Kosecka","In this work, we propose a modular approach for the Vision-Language
Navigation (VLN) task by decomposing the problem into four sub-modules that use
state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
in a zero-shot setting. Given navigation instruction in natural language, we
first prompt LLM to extract the landmarks and the order in which they are
visited. Assuming the known model of the environment, we retrieve the top-k
locations of the last landmark and generate $k$ path hypotheses from the
starting location to the last landmark using the shortest path algorithm on the
topological map of the environment. Each path hypothesis is represented by a
sequence of panoramas. We then use dynamic programming to compute the alignment
score between the sequence of panoramas and the sequence of landmark names,
which match scores obtained from VLM. Finally, we compute the nDTW metric
between the hypothesis that yields the highest alignment score to evaluate the
path fidelity. We demonstrate superior performance compared to other approaches

Generation of Drug-Induced Cardiac Reactions towards Virtual Clinical Trials,11/02/2025,"Qian Shao, Bang Du, Zepeng Li, Qiyuan Chen, Hongxia Xu, Jimeng Sun, Jian Wu, Jintai Chen","Clinical trials are pivotal in cardiac drug development, yet they often fail
due to inadequate efficacy and unexpected safety issues, leading to significant
financial losses. Using in-silico trials to replace a part of physical clinical
trials, e.g., leveraging advanced generative models to generate drug-influenced
electrocardiograms (ECGs), seems an effective method to reduce financial risk
and potential harm to trial participants. While existing generative models have
demonstrated progress in ECG generation, they fall short in modeling drug
reactions due to limited fidelity and inability to capture individualized drug
response patterns. In this paper, we propose a Drug-Aware Diffusion Model
(DADM), which could simulate individualized drug reactions while ensuring
fidelity. To ensure fidelity, we construct a set of ordinary differential
equations to provide external physical knowledge (EPK) of the realistic ECG
morphology. The EPK is used to adaptively constrain the morphology of the
generated ECGs through a dynamic cross-attention (DCA) mechanism. Furthermore,
we propose an extension of ControlNet to incorporate demographic and drug data,
simulating individual drug reactions. We compare DADM with the other eight
state-of-the-art ECG generative models on two real-world databases covering 8

Negative Dependence as a toolbox for machine learning : review and new developments,11/02/2025,"Hoang-Son Tran, Vladimir Petrovic, Remi Bardenet, Subhroshekhar Ghosh","Negative dependence is becoming a key driver in advancing learning
capabilities beyond the limits of traditional independence. Recent developments
have evidenced support towards negatively dependent systems as a learning
paradigm in a broad range of fundamental machine learning challenges including
optimization, sampling, dimensionality reduction and sparse signal recovery,
often surpassing the performance of current methods based on statistical
independence. The most popular negatively dependent model has been that of
determinantal point processes (DPPs), which have their origins in quantum
theory. However, other models, such as perturbed lattice models, strongly
Rayleigh measures, zeros of random functions have gained salience in various
learning applications. In this article, we review this burgeoning field of
research, as it has developed over the past two decades or so. We also present
new results on applications of DPPs to the parsimonious representation of
neural networks. In the limited scope of the article, we mostly focus on
aspects of this area to which the authors contributed over the recent years,
including applications to Monte Carlo methods, coresets and stochastic gradient
descent, stochastic networks, signal processing and connections to quantum
computation. However, starting from basics of negative dependence for the
uninitiated reader, extensive references are provided to a broad swath of
related developments which could not be covered within our limited scope. While
existing works and reviews generally focus on specific negatively dependent
models (e.g. DPPs), a notable feature of this article is that it addresses
negative dependence as a machine learning methodology as a whole. In this vein,
it covers within its span an array of negatively dependent models and their
applications well beyond DPPs, thereby putting forward a very general and

NARCE: A Mamba-Based Neural Algorithmic Reasoner Framework for Online Complex Event Detection,11/02/2025,"Liying Han, Gaofeng Dong, Xiaomin Ouyang, Lance Kaplan, Federico Cerutti, Mani Srivastava","Current machine learning models excel in short-span perception tasks but
struggle to derive high-level insights from long-term observation, a capability
central to understanding complex events (CEs). CEs, defined as sequences of
short-term atomic events (AEs) governed by spatiotemporal rules, are
challenging to detect online due to the need to extract meaningful patterns
from long and noisy sensor data while ignoring irrelevant events. We
hypothesize that state-based methods are well-suited for CE detection, as they
capture event progression through state transitions without requiring long-term
memory. Baseline experiments validate this, demonstrating that the state-space
model Mamba outperforms existing architectures. However, Mamba's reliance on
extensive labeled data, which are difficult to obtain, motivates our second
hypothesis: decoupling CE rule learning from noisy sensor data can reduce data
requirements. To address this, we propose NARCE, a framework that combines
Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) to split the task into two components: (i)
learning CE rules independently of sensor data using synthetic concept traces
generated by LLMs and (ii) mapping sensor inputs to these rules via an adapter.
Our results show that NARCE outperforms baselines in accuracy, generalization
to unseen and longer sensor data, and data efficiency, significantly reducing

Linear Transformers as VAR Models: Aligning Autoregressive Attention Mechanisms with Autoregressive Forecasting,11/02/2025,"Jiecheng Lu, Shihao Yang","Autoregressive attention-based time series forecasting (TSF) has drawn
increasing interest, with mechanisms like linear attention sometimes
outperforming vanilla attention. However, deeper Transformer architectures
frequently misalign with autoregressive objectives, obscuring the underlying
VAR structure embedded within linear attention and hindering their ability to
capture the data generative processes in TSF. In this work, we first show that
a single linear attention layer can be interpreted as a dynamic vector
autoregressive (VAR) structure. We then explain that existing multi-layer
Transformers have structural mismatches with the autoregressive forecasting
objective, which impair interpretability and generalization ability. To address
this, we show that by rearranging the MLP, attention, and input-output flow,
multi-layer linear attention can also be aligned as a VAR model. Then, we
propose Structural Aligned Mixture of VAR (SAMoVAR), a linear Transformer
variant that integrates interpretable dynamic VAR weights for multivariate TSF.

Does Training on Synthetic Data Make Models Less Robust?,11/02/2025,"Lingze Zhang, Ellie Pavlick","An increasingly common practice is to train large language models (LLMs)
using synthetic data. Often this synthetic data is produced by the same or
similar LLMs as those it is being used to train. This raises the question of
whether the synthetic data might in fact exacerbate certain ""blindspots"" by
reinforcing heuristics that the LLM already encodes. In this paper, we conduct
simulated experiments on the natural language inference (NLI) task with
Llama-2-7B-hf models. We use MultiNLI as the general task and HANS, a targeted
evaluation set designed to measure the presence of specific heuristic
strategies for NLI, as our ""blindspot"" task. Our goal is to determine whether
performance disparities between the general and blind spot tasks emerge. Our
results indicate that synthetic data does not reinforce blindspots in the way
we expected. Specifically, we see that, while fine-tuning with synthetic data
doesn't necessarily reduce the use of the heuristic, it also does not make it
worse as we hypothesized.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07164v1,,False
