Differential Information: An Information-Theoretic Perspective on Preference Optimization,29/05/2025,"Yunjae Won, Hyunji Lee, Hyeonbin Hwang, Minjoon Seo","Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has become a standard technique for
aligning language models with human preferences in a supervised manner. Despite
its empirical success, the theoretical justification behind its log-ratio
reward parameterization remains incomplete. In this work, we address this gap
by utilizing the Differential Information Distribution (DID): a distribution
over token sequences that captures the information gained during policy
updates. First, we show that when preference labels encode the differential
information required to transform a reference policy into a target policy, the
log-ratio reward in DPO emerges as the uniquely optimal form for learning the
target policy via preference optimization. This result naturally yields a
closed-form expression for the optimal sampling distribution over rejected
responses. Second, we find that the condition for preferences to encode
differential information is fundamentally linked to an implicit assumption
regarding log-margin ordered policies-an inductive bias widely used in
preference optimization yet previously unrecognized. Finally, by analyzing the
entropy of the DID, we characterize how learning low-entropy differential
information reinforces the policy distribution, while high-entropy differential
information induces a smoothing effect, which explains the log-likelihood
displacement phenomenon. We validate our theoretical findings in synthetic
experiments and extend them to real-world instruction-following datasets. Our
results suggest that learning high-entropy differential information is crucial
for general instruction-following, while learning low-entropy differential
information benefits knowledge-intensive question answering. Overall, our work
presents a unifying perspective on the DPO objective, the structure of
preference data, and resulting policy behaviors through the lens of
differential information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23761v1,,False
REOrdering Patches Improves Vision Models,29/05/2025,"Declan Kutscher, David M. Chan, Yutong Bai, Trevor Darrell, Ritwik Gupta","Sequence models such as transformers require inputs to be represented as
one-dimensional sequences. In vision, this typically involves flattening images
using a fixed row-major (raster-scan) order. While full self-attention is
permutation-equivariant, modern long-sequence transformers increasingly rely on
architectural approximations that break this invariance and introduce
sensitivity to patch ordering. We show that patch order significantly affects
model performance in such settings, with simple alternatives like column-major
or Hilbert curves yielding notable accuracy shifts. Motivated by this, we
propose REOrder, a two-stage framework for discovering task-optimal patch
orderings. First, we derive an information-theoretic prior by evaluating the
compressibility of various patch sequences. Then, we learn a policy over
permutations by optimizing a Plackett-Luce policy using REINFORCE. This
approach enables efficient learning in a combinatorial permutation space.
REOrder improves top-1 accuracy over row-major ordering on ImageNet-1K by up to
3.01% and Functional Map of the World by 13.35%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23751v1,,False
ATLAS: Learning to Optimally Memorize the Context at Test Time,29/05/2025,"Ali Behrouz, Zeman Li, Praneeth Kacham, Majid Daliri, Yuan Deng, Peilin Zhong, Meisam Razaviyayn, Vahab Mirrokni","Transformers have been established as the most popular backbones in sequence
modeling, mainly due to their effectiveness in in-context retrieval tasks and
the ability to learn at scale. Their quadratic memory and time complexity,
however, bound their applicability in longer sequences and so has motivated
researchers to explore effective alternative architectures such as modern
recurrent neural networks (a.k.a long-term recurrent memory module). Despite
their recent success in diverse downstream tasks, they struggle in tasks that
requires long context understanding and extrapolation to longer sequences. We
observe that these shortcomings come from three disjoint aspects in their
design: (1) limited memory capacity that is bounded by the architecture of
memory and feature mapping of the input; (2) online nature of update, i.e.,
optimizing the memory only with respect to the last input; and (3) less
expressive management of their fixed-size memory. To enhance all these three
aspects, we present ATLAS, a long-term memory module with high capacity that
learns to memorize the context by optimizing the memory based on the current
and past tokens, overcoming the online nature of long-term memory models.
Building on this insight, we present a new family of Transformer-like
architectures, called DeepTransformers, that are strict generalizations of the
original Transformer architecture. Our experimental results on language
modeling, common-sense reasoning, recall-intensive, and long-context
understanding tasks show that ATLAS surpasses the performance of Transformers
and recent linear recurrent models. ATLAS further improves the long context
performance of Titans, achieving +80\% accuracy in 10M context length of

Exposing the Impact of GenAI for Cybercrime: An Investigation into the Dark Side,29/05/2025,"Truong, Luu, Binny M. Samuel","In recent years, the rapid advancement and democratization of generative AI
models have sparked significant debate over safety, ethical risks, and dual-use
concerns, particularly in the context of cybersecurity. While anecdotally
known, this paper provides empirical evidence regarding generative AI's

examining the phenomenon through psychological frameworks of technological
amplification and affordance theory. Using a quasi-experimental design with
interrupted time series analysis, we analyze two datasets, one general and one
cryptocurrency-focused, to empirically assess generative AI's role in

Data-to-Dashboard: Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Insightful Visualization in Enterprise Analytics,29/05/2025,"Ran Zhang, Mohannad Elhamod","The rapid advancement of LLMs has led to the creation of diverse agentic
systems in data analysis, utilizing LLMs' capabilities to improve insight
generation and visualization. In this paper, we present an agentic system that
automates the data-to-dashboard pipeline through modular LLM agents capable of
domain detection, concept extraction, multi-perspective analysis generation,
and iterative self-reflection. Unlike existing chart QA systems, our framework
simulates the analytical reasoning process of business analysts by retrieving
domain-relevant knowledge and adapting to diverse datasets without relying on
closed ontologies or question templates.
  We evaluate our system on three datasets across different domains.
Benchmarked against GPT-4o with a single-prompt baseline, our approach shows
improved insightfulness, domain relevance, and analytical depth, as measured by
tailored evaluation metrics and qualitative human assessment.

Mobi-$π$: Mobilizing Your Robot Learning Policy,29/05/2025,"Jingyun Yang, Isabella Huang, Brandon Vu, Max Bajracharya, Rika Antonova, Jeannette Bohg","Learned visuomotor policies are capable of performing increasingly complex
manipulation tasks. However, most of these policies are trained on data
collected from limited robot positions and camera viewpoints. This leads to
poor generalization to novel robot positions, which limits the use of these
policies on mobile platforms, especially for precise tasks like pressing
buttons or turning faucets. In this work, we formulate the policy mobilization
problem: find a mobile robot base pose in a novel environment that is in
distribution with respect to a manipulation policy trained on a limited set of
camera viewpoints. Compared to retraining the policy itself to be more robust
to unseen robot base pose initializations, policy mobilization decouples
navigation from manipulation and thus does not require additional
demonstrations. Crucially, this problem formulation complements existing
efforts to improve manipulation policy robustness to novel viewpoints and
remains compatible with them. To study policy mobilization, we introduce the
Mobi-$\pi$ framework, which includes: (1) metrics that quantify the difficulty
of mobilizing a given policy, (2) a suite of simulated mobile manipulation
tasks based on RoboCasa to evaluate policy mobilization, (3) visualization
tools for analysis, and (4) several baseline methods. We also propose a novel
approach that bridges navigation and manipulation by optimizing the robot's
base pose to align with an in-distribution base pose for a learned policy. Our
approach utilizes 3D Gaussian Splatting for novel view synthesis, a score
function to evaluate pose suitability, and sampling-based optimization to
identify optimal robot poses. We show that our approach outperforms baselines
in both simulation and real-world environments, demonstrating its effectiveness
for policy mobilization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23692v1,,False
LoLA: Low-Rank Linear Attention With Sparse Caching,29/05/2025,"Luke McDermott, Robert W. Heath Jr., Rahul Parhi","Transformer-based large language models suffer from quadratic complexity at
inference on long sequences. Linear attention methods are efficient
alternatives, however, they fail to provide an accurate approximation of
softmax attention. By additionally incorporating sliding window attention into
each linear attention head, this gap can be closed for short context-length
tasks. Unfortunately, these approaches cannot recall important information from
long contexts due to ""memory collisions"". In this paper , we propose LoLA:
Low-rank Linear Attention with sparse caching. LoLA separately stores
additional key-value pairs that would otherwise interfere with past associative
memories. Moreover, LoLA further closes the gap between linear attention models
and transformers by distributing past key-value pairs into three forms of
memory: (i) recent pairs in a local sliding window; (ii) difficult-to-memorize
pairs in a sparse, global cache; and (iii) generic pairs in the recurrent
hidden state of linear attention. As an inference-only strategy, LoLA enables
pass-key retrieval on up to 8K context lengths on needle-in-a-haystack tasks
from RULER. It boosts the accuracy of the base subquadratic model from 0.6% to
97.4% at 4K context lengths, with a 4.6x smaller cache than that of Llama-3.1
8B. LoLA demonstrates strong performance on zero-shot commonsense reasoning
tasks among 1B and 8B parameter subquadratic models. Finally, LoLA is an
extremely lightweight approach: Nearly all of our results can be reproduced on
a single consumer GPU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23666v1,,False
AMBER: Adaptive Mesh Generation by Iterative Mesh Resolution Prediction,29/05/2025,"Niklas Freymuth, Tobias Würth, Nicolas Schreiber, Balazs Gyenes, Andreas Boltres, Johannes Mitsch, Aleksandar Taranovic, Tai Hoang, Philipp Dahlinger, Philipp Becker, Luise Kärger, Gerhard Neumann","The cost and accuracy of simulating complex physical systems using the Finite
Element Method (FEM) scales with the resolution of the underlying mesh.
Adaptive meshes improve computational efficiency by refining resolution in
critical regions, but typically require task-specific heuristics or cumbersome
manual design by a human expert. We propose Adaptive Meshing By Expert
Reconstruction (AMBER), a supervised learning approach to mesh adaptation.
Starting from a coarse mesh, AMBER iteratively predicts the sizing field, i.e.,
a function mapping from the geometry to the local element size of the target
mesh, and uses this prediction to produce a new intermediate mesh using an
out-of-the-box mesh generator. This process is enabled through a hierarchical
graph neural network, and relies on data augmentation by automatically
projecting expert labels onto AMBER-generated data during training. We evaluate
AMBER on 2D and 3D datasets, including classical physics problems, mechanical
components, and real-world industrial designs with human expert meshes. AMBER
generalizes to unseen geometries and consistently outperforms multiple recent

Improving Time Series Forecasting via Instance-aware Post-hoc Revision,29/05/2025,"Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Guanhao Zhao, Jiqian Yang, Qi Liu, Enhong Chen","Time series forecasting plays a vital role in various real-world applications
and has attracted significant attention in recent decades. While recent methods
have achieved remarkable accuracy by incorporating advanced inductive biases
and training strategies, we observe that instance-level variations remain a
significant challenge. These variations--stemming from distribution shifts,
missing data, and long-tail patterns--often lead to suboptimal forecasts for
specific instances, even when overall performance appears strong. To address
this issue, we propose a model-agnostic framework, PIR, designed to enhance
forecasting performance through Post-forecasting Identification and Revision.
Specifically, PIR first identifies biased forecasting instances by estimating
their accuracy. Based on this, the framework revises the forecasts using
contextual information, including covariates and historical time series, from
both local and global perspectives in a post-processing fashion. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with mainstream forecasting models
demonstrate that PIR effectively mitigates instance-level errors and
significantly improves forecasting reliability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23583v1,,False

Maximum Likelihood Learning of Latent Dynamics Without Reconstruction,29/05/2025,"Samo Hromadka, Kai Biegun, Lior Fox, James Heald, Maneesh Sahani","We introduce a novel unsupervised learning method for time series data with
latent dynamical structure: the recognition-parametrized Gaussian state space
model (RP-GSSM). The RP-GSSM is a probabilistic model that learns Markovian
Gaussian latents explaining statistical dependence between observations at
different time steps, combining the intuition of contrastive methods with the
flexible tools of probabilistic generative models. Unlike contrastive
approaches, the RP-GSSM is a valid probabilistic model learned via maximum
likelihood. Unlike generative approaches, the RP-GSSM has no need for an
explicit network mapping from latents to observations, allowing it to focus
model capacity on inference of latents. The model is both tractable and
expressive: it admits exact inference thanks to its jointly Gaussian latent
prior, while maintaining expressivity with an arbitrarily nonlinear neural
network link between observations and latents. These qualities allow the
RP-GSSM to learn task-relevant latents without ad-hoc regularization, auxiliary
losses, or optimizer scheduling. We show how this approach outperforms
alternatives on problems that include learning nonlinear stochastic dynamics
from video, with or without background distractors. Our results position the
RP-GSSM as a useful foundation model for a variety of downstream applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23569v1,,False
DeepFilterGAN: A Full-band Real-time Speech Enhancement System with GAN-based Stochastic Regeneration,29/05/2025,"Sanberk Serbest, Tijana Stojkovic, Milos Cernak, Andrew Harper","In this work, we propose a full-band real-time speech enhancement system with
GAN-based stochastic regeneration. Predictive models focus on estimating the
mean of the target distribution, whereas generative models aim to learn the
full distribution. This behavior of predictive models may lead to
over-suppression, i.e. the removal of speech content. In the literature, it was
shown that combining a predictive model with a generative one within the
stochastic regeneration framework can reduce the distortion in the output. We
use this framework to obtain a real-time speech enhancement system. With 3.58M

TimePoint: Accelerated Time Series Alignment via Self-Supervised Keypoint and Descriptor Learning,29/05/2025,"Ron Shapira Weber, Shahar Ben Ishay, Andrey Lavrinenko, Shahaf E. Finder, Oren Freifeld","Fast and scalable alignment of time series is a fundamental challenge in many
domains. The standard solution, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), struggles with poor
scalability and sensitivity to noise. We introduce TimePoint, a self-supervised
method that dramatically accelerates DTW-based alignment while typically
improving alignment accuracy by learning keypoints and descriptors from
synthetic data. Inspired by 2D keypoint detection but carefully adapted to the
unique challenges of 1D signals, TimePoint leverages efficient 1D
diffeomorphisms, which effectively model nonlinear time warping, to generate
realistic training data. This approach, along with fully convolutional and
wavelet convolutional architectures, enables the extraction of informative
keypoints and descriptors. Applying DTW to these sparse representations yield
major speedups and typically higher alignment accuracy than standard DTW
applied to the full signals. TimePoint demonstrates strong generalization to
real-world time series when trained solely on synthetic data, and further

A Unified Framework for Human AI Collaboration in Security Operations Centers with Trusted Autonomy,29/05/2025,"Ahmad Mohsin, Helge Janicke, Ahmed Ibrahim, Iqbal H. Sarker, Seyit Camtepe","This article presents a structured framework for Human-AI collaboration in
Security Operations Centers (SOCs), integrating AI autonomy, trust calibration,
and Human-in-the-loop decision making. Existing frameworks in SOCs often focus
narrowly on automation, lacking systematic structures to manage human
oversight, trust calibration, and scalable autonomy with AI. Many assume static
or binary autonomy settings, failing to account for the varied complexity,
criticality, and risk across SOC tasks considering Humans and AI collaboration.
To address these limitations, we propose a novel autonomy tiered framework
grounded in five levels of AI autonomy from manual to fully autonomous, mapped
to Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) roles and task-specific trust thresholds. This
enables adaptive and explainable AI integration across core SOC functions,
including monitoring, protection, threat detection, alert triage, and incident

by creating formal connections between autonomy, trust, and HITL across various
SOC levels, which allows for adaptive task distribution according to
operational complexity and associated risks. The framework is exemplified
through a simulated cyber range that features the cybersecurity AI-Avatar, a

Sentinel: Scheduling Live Streams with Proactive Anomaly Detection in Crowdsourced Cloud-Edge Platforms,29/05/2025,"Yuting Li, Shaoyuan Huang, Tengwen Zhang, Cheng Zhang, Xiaofei Wang, Victor C. M. Leung","With the rapid growth of live streaming services, Crowdsourced Cloud-edge

Sentinel, a proactive anomaly detection-based scheduling framework. Sentinel
models the scheduling process as a two-stage Pre-Post-Scheduling paradigm: in
the pre-scheduling stage, Sentinel conducts anomaly detection and constructs a

FreRA: A Frequency-Refined Augmentation for Contrastive Learning on Time Series Classification,29/05/2025,"Tian Tian, Chunyan Miao, Hangwei Qian","Contrastive learning has emerged as a competent approach for unsupervised
representation learning. However, the design of an optimal augmentation
strategy, although crucial for contrastive learning, is less explored for time
series classification tasks. Existing predefined time-domain augmentation
methods are primarily adopted from vision and are not specific to time series
data. Consequently, this cross-modality incompatibility may distort the
semantically relevant information of time series by introducing mismatched
patterns into the data. To address this limitation, we present a novel
perspective from the frequency domain and identify three advantages for
downstream classification: global, independent, and compact. To fully utilize

Hybrid Cross-domain Robust Reinforcement Learning,29/05/2025,"Linh Le Pham Van, Minh Hoang Nguyen, Hung Le, Hung The Tran, Sunil Gupta","Robust reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn policies that remain
effective despite uncertainties in its environment, which frequently arise in
real-world applications due to variations in environment dynamics. The robust
RL methods learn a robust policy by maximizing value under the worst-case
models within a predefined uncertainty set. Offline robust RL algorithms are
particularly promising in scenarios where only a fixed dataset is available and
new data cannot be collected. However, these approaches often require extensive
offline data, and gathering such datasets for specific tasks in specific
environments can be both costly and time-consuming. Using an imperfect
simulator offers a faster, cheaper, and safer way to collect data for training,
but it can suffer from dynamics mismatch. In this paper, we introduce HYDRO,
the first Hybrid Cross-Domain Robust RL framework designed to address these
challenges. HYDRO utilizes an online simulator to complement the limited amount
of offline datasets in the non-trivial context of robust RL. By measuring and
minimizing performance gaps between the simulator and the worst-case models in
the uncertainty set, HYDRO employs novel uncertainty filtering and prioritized
sampling to select the most relevant and reliable simulator samples. Our
extensive experiments demonstrate HYDRO's superior performance over existing
methods across various tasks, underscoring its potential to improve sample
efficiency in offline robust RL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23003v1,,False
Theoretical Foundations of the Deep Copula Classifier: A Generative Approach to Modeling Dependent Features,29/05/2025,"Agnideep Aich, Ashit Baran Aich, Bruce Wade","Traditional classifiers often assume feature independence or rely on overly
simplistic relationships, leading to poor performance in settings where
real-world dependencies matter. We introduce the Deep Copula Classifier (DCC),
a generative model that separates the learning of each feature's marginal
distribution from the modeling of their joint dependence structure via neural
network-parameterized copulas. For each class, lightweight neural networks are
used to flexibly and adaptively capture feature interactions, making DCC
particularly effective when classification is driven by complex dependencies.
We establish that DCC converges to the Bayes-optimal classifier under standard
conditions and provide explicit convergence rates of O(n^{-r/(2r + d)}) for
r-smooth copula densities. Beyond theoretical guarantees, we outline several
practical extensions, including high-dimensional scalability through vine and
factor copula architectures, semi-supervised learning via entropy
regularization, and online adaptation using streaming gradient methods. By
unifying statistical rigor with the representational power of neural networks,
DCC offers a mathematically grounded and interpretable framework for
dependency-aware classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22997v1,,False
Toward Memory-Aided World Models: Benchmarking via Spatial Consistency,29/05/2025,"Kewei Lian, Shaofei Cai, Yilun Du, Yitao Liang","The ability to simulate the world in a spatially consistent manner is a
crucial requirements for effective world models. Such a model enables
high-quality visual generation, and also ensures the reliability of world
models for downstream tasks such as simulation and planning. Designing a memory
module is a crucial component for addressing spatial consistency: such a model
must not only retain long-horizon observational information, but also enables
the construction of explicit or implicit internal spatial representations.
However, there are no dataset designed to promote the development of memory
modules by explicitly enforcing spatial consistency constraints. Furthermore,
most existing benchmarks primarily emphasize visual coherence or generation
quality, neglecting the requirement of long-range spatial consistency. To
bridge this gap, we construct a dataset and corresponding benchmark by sampling
150 distinct locations within the open-world environment of Minecraft,
collecting about 250 hours (20 million frames) of loop-based navigation videos
with actions. Our dataset follows a curriculum design of sequence lengths,
allowing models to learn spatial consistency on increasingly complex navigation
trajectories. Furthermore, our data collection pipeline is easily extensible to
new Minecraft environments and modules. Four representative world model
baselines are evaluated on our benchmark. Dataset, benchmark, and code are
open-sourced to support future research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22976v1,,False
Directed Graph Grammars for Sequence-based Learning,29/05/2025,"Michael Sun, Orion Foo, Gang Liu, Wojciech Matusik, Jie Chen","Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are a class of graphs commonly used in
practice, with examples that include electronic circuits, Bayesian networks,
and neural architectures. While many effective encoders exist for DAGs, it
remains challenging to decode them in a principled manner, because the nodes of
a DAG can have many different topological orders. In this work, we propose a
grammar-based approach to constructing a principled, compact and equivalent
sequential representation of a DAG. Specifically, we view a graph as
derivations over an unambiguous grammar, where the DAG corresponds to a unique
sequence of production rules. Equivalently, the procedure to construct such a
description can be viewed as a lossless compression of the data. Such a
representation has many uses, including building a generative model for graph
generation, learning a latent space for property prediction, and leveraging the
sequence representational continuity for Bayesian Optimization over structured
data. Code is available at https://github.com/shiningsunnyday/induction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22949v1,,False
