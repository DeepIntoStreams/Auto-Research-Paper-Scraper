Pre-training and in-context learning IS Bayesian inference a la De Finetti,06/08/2024,"Naimeng Ye, Hanming Yang, Andrew Siah, Hongseok Namkoong","Accurately gauging uncertainty on the underlying environment is a
longstanding goal of intelligent systems. We characterize which latent concepts
pre-trained sequence models are naturally able to reason with. We go back to De
Finetti's predictive view of Bayesian reasoning: instead of modeling latent
parameters through priors and likelihoods like topic models do, De Finetti has
long advocated for modeling exchangeable (permutation invariant) sequences of
observables. According to this view, pre-training autoregressive models
formulates informed beliefs based on prior observations (""empirical Bayes""),
and forward generation is a simulated instantiation of an environment
(""posterior inference""). This connection allows extending in-context learning
(ICL) beyond predictive settings, highlighting sequence models' ability to
perform explicit statistical inference. In particular, we show the sequence
prediction loss over exchangeable documents controls performance on downstream
tasks where uncertainty quantification is key. Empirically, we propose and
demonstrate several approaches for encoding exchangeability in sequence model
architectures: data augmentation, regularization, and causal masking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03307v1,,False
KaPO: Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization for Controllable Knowledge Selection in Retrieval-Augmented Language Models,06/08/2024,"Ruizhe Zhang, Yongxin Xu, Yuzhen Xiao, Runchuan Zhu, Xinke Jiang, Xu Chu, Junfeng Zhao, Yasha Wang","By integrating external knowledge, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has
become an effective strategy for mitigating the hallucination problems that
large language models (LLMs) encounter when dealing with knowledge-intensive
tasks. However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric
supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge
conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance
the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused
on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless,
due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives,
models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors in the
intricate and realistic retrieval scenarios. To this end, we propose a
Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization, dubbed KaPO, aimed at achieving
controllable knowledge selection in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we
explore and simulate error types across diverse context combinations and learn
how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods.
Simultaneously, by adjusting the balance between response length and the
proportion of preference data representing different behavior patterns, we
enhance the adherence capabilities and noise robustness of LLMs in a balanced
manner. Experimental results show that KaPO outperforms previous methods for
handling knowledge conflicts by over 37%, while also exhibiting robust
generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03297v1,,False
Analysis of Partially-Calibrated Sparse Subarrays for Direction Finding with Extended Degrees of Freedom,06/08/2024,"W. S. Leite, R. C. de Lamare","This paper investigates the problem of direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation
using multiple partially-calibrated sparse subarrays. In particular, we present
the Generalized Coarray Multiple Signal Classification (GCA-MUSIC) DOA
estimation algorithm to scenarios with partially-calibrated sparse subarrays.
The proposed GCA-MUSIC algorithm exploits the difference coarray for each
subarray, followed by a specific pseudo-spectrum merging rule that is based on
the intersection of the signal subspaces associated to each subarray. This rule
assumes that there is no a priori knowledge about the cross-covariance between
subarrays. In that way, only the second-order statistics of each subarray are
used to estimate the directions with increased degrees of freedom, i.e., the
estimation procedure preserves the coarray Multiple Signal Classification and
sparse arrays properties to estimate more sources than the number of physical
sensors in each subarray. Numerical simulations show that the proposed
GCA-MUSIC has better performance than other similar strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03236v1,,False
Learning to Learn without Forgetting using Attention,06/08/2024,"Anna Vettoruzzo, Joaquin Vanschoren, Mohamed-Rafik Bouguelia, Thorsteinn RÃ¶gnvaldsson","Continual learning (CL) refers to the ability to continually learn over time
by accommodating new knowledge while retaining previously learned experience.
While this concept is inherent in human learning, current machine learning
methods are highly prone to overwrite previously learned patterns and thus
forget past experience. Instead, model parameters should be updated selectively
and carefully, avoiding unnecessary forgetting while optimally leveraging
previously learned patterns to accelerate future learning. Since hand-crafting
effective update mechanisms is difficult, we propose meta-learning a
transformer-based optimizer to enhance CL. This meta-learned optimizer uses
attention to learn the complex relationships between model parameters across a
stream of tasks, and is designed to generate effective weight updates for the
current task while preventing catastrophic forgetting on previously encountered
tasks. Evaluations on benchmark datasets like SplitMNIST, RotatedMNIST, and
SplitCIFAR-100 affirm the efficacy of the proposed approach in terms of both
forward and backward transfer, even on small sets of labeled data, highlighting
the advantages of integrating a meta-learned optimizer within the continual
learning framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03219v1,,False
Adversarial Safety-Critical Scenario Generation using Naturalistic Human Driving Priors,06/08/2024,"Kunkun Hao, Yonggang Luo, Wen Cui, Yuqiao Bai, Jucheng Yang, Songyang Yan, Yuxi Pan, Zijiang Yang","Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing
autonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test
scenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial, thanks
to the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets.
To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce a natural adversarial
scenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and
reinforcement learning techniques. By doing this, we can obtain large-scale
test scenarios that are both diverse and realistic. Specifically, we build a
simulation environment that mimics natural traffic interaction scenarios.
Informed by this environment, we implement a two-stage procedure. The first
stage incorporates conventional rule-based models, e.g., IDM~(Intelligent
Driver Model) and MOBIL~(Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes)
model, to coarsely and discretely capture and calibrate key control parameters
from the real-world dataset. Next, we leverage GAIL~(Generative Adversarial
Imitation Learning) to represent driver behaviors continuously. The derived
GAIL can be further used to design a PPO~(Proximal Policy Optimization)-based
actor-critic network framework to fine-tune the reward function, and then
optimizes our natural adversarial scenario generation solution. Extensive
experiments have been conducted in the NGSIM dataset including the trajectory
of 3,000 vehicles. Essential traffic parameters were measured in comparison
with the baseline model, e.g., the collision rate, accelerations, steering, and
the number of lane changes. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model
can generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness
and adversariality, which can be a cornerstone for the development of
autonomous vehicles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03200v1,10.1109/TIV.2023.3335862,False
Convergence Conditions for Stochastic Line Search Based Optimization of Over-parametrized Models,06/08/2024,"Matteo Lapucci, Davide Pucci","In this paper, we deal with algorithms to solve the finite-sum problems
related to fitting over-parametrized models, that typically satisfy the
interpolation condition. In particular, we focus on approaches based on
stochastic line searches and employing general search directions. We define
conditions on the sequence of search directions that guarantee finite
termination and bounds for the backtracking procedure. Moreover, we shed light
on the additional property of directions needed to prove fast (linear)
convergence of the general class of algorithms when applied to PL functions in
the interpolation regime. From the point of view of algorithms design, the
proposed analysis identifies safeguarding conditions that could be employed in
relevant algorithmic framework. In particular, it could be of interest to
integrate stochastic line searches within momentum, conjugate gradient or
adaptive preconditioning methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03199v1,,False
Solving QUBO on the Loihi 2 Neuromorphic Processor,06/08/2024,"Alessandro Pierro, Philipp Stratmann, Gabriel Andres Fonseca Guerra, Sumedh Risbud, Timothy Shea, Ashish Rao Mangalore, Andreas Wild","In this article, we describe an algorithm for solving Quadratic Unconstrained
Binary Optimization problems on the Intel Loihi 2 neuromorphic processor. The
solver is based on a hardware-aware fine-grained parallel simulated annealing
algorithm developed for Intel's neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. Preliminary
results show that our approach can generate feasible solutions in as little as
1 ms and up to 37x more energy efficient compared to two baseline solvers
running on a CPU. These advantages could be especially relevant for size-,
weight-, and power-constrained edge computing applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03076v1,,False
ASR-enhanced Multimodal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain Product Retrieval,06/08/2024,"Ruixiang Zhao, Jian Jia, Yan Li, Xuehan Bai, Quan Chen, Han Li, Peng Jiang, Xirong Li","E-commerce is increasingly multimedia-enriched, with products exhibited in a
broad-domain manner as images, short videos, or live stream promotions. A
unified and vectorized cross-domain production representation is essential. Due
to large intra-product variance and high inter-product similarity in the
broad-domain scenario, a visual-only representation is inadequate. While
Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) text derived from the short or live-stream
videos is readily accessible, how to de-noise the excessively noisy text for
multimodal representation learning is mostly untouched. We propose ASR-enhanced
Multimodal Product Representation Learning (AMPere). In order to extract
product-specific information from the raw ASR text, AMPere uses an
easy-to-implement LLM-based ASR text summarizer. The LLM-summarized text,
together with visual data, is then fed into a multi-branch network to generate
compact multimodal embeddings. Extensive experiments on a large-scale
tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified
multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product
retrieval.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02978v1,,False
Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator,06/08/2024,"Xinghao Dong, Chuanqi Chen, Jin-Long Wu","Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical
systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical
simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems
without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often
lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many
real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling
framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via
conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier
neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which
serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how
accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven
stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology
provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to
construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical
systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02965v1,,False
Compromising Embodied Agents with Contextual Backdoor Attacks,06/08/2024,"Aishan Liu, Yuguang Zhou, Xianglong Liu, Tianyuan Zhang, Siyuan Liang, Jiakai Wang, Yanjun Pu, Tianlin Li, Junqi Zhang, Wenbo Zhou, Qing Guo, Dacheng Tao","Large language models (LLMs) have transformed the development of embodied
intelligence. By providing a few contextual demonstrations, developers can
utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate
complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets,
which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this
paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and
introduces a novel method called \method{}. By poisoning just a few contextual
demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of
a black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent
defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can
activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters
specific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM's
contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize
poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts,
reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in
a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable
context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality
activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program
defects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack
by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of
confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate
the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across
various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional
visual reasoning. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our
approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02882v1,,False
