A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents,05/03/2025,"Shen Dong, Shaocheng Xu, Pengfei He, Yige Li, Jiliang Tang, Tianming Liu, Hui Liu, Zhen Xiang","Agents based on large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in a wide range of complex, real-world applications. However, LLM
agents with a compromised memory bank may easily produce harmful outputs when
the past records retrieved for demonstration are malicious. In this paper, we
propose a novel Memory INJection Attack, MINJA, that enables the injection of
malicious records into the memory bank by only interacting with the agent via
queries and output observations. These malicious records are designed to elicit
a sequence of malicious reasoning steps leading to undesirable agent actions
when executing the victim user's query. Specifically, we introduce a sequence
of bridging steps to link the victim query to the malicious reasoning steps.
During the injection of the malicious record, we propose an indication prompt
to guide the agent to autonomously generate our designed bridging steps. We
also propose a progressive shortening strategy that gradually removes the
indication prompt, such that the malicious record will be easily retrieved when
processing the victim query comes after. Our extensive experiments across
diverse agents demonstrate the effectiveness of MINJA in compromising agent
memory. With minimal requirements for execution, MINJA enables any user to
influence agent memory, highlighting practical risks of LLM agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03704v1,,False

handwritten digit classification as a benchmark, we study how accuracy depends
on propagation dynamics, as well as parameters governing spectral encoding,
readout, and noise. Test accuracies of over 91% and 93% are found for
propagation in the anomalous and normal dispersion regimes respectively. Our
simulation results also suggest that quantum noise on the input pulses

Simulation-Based Performance Evaluation of 3D Object Detection Methods with Deep Learning for a LiDAR Point Cloud Dataset in a SOTIF-related Use Case,05/03/2025,"Milin Patel, Rolf Jung","Safety of the Intended Functionality (SOTIF) addresses sensor performance
limitations and deep learning-based object detection insufficiencies to ensure
the intended functionality of Automated Driving Systems (ADS). This paper

the 3D object detection methods on a LiDAR point cloud dataset generated by
simulating a SOTIF-related Use Case. The major contributions of this paper

AI-Enabled Conversational Journaling for Advancing Parkinson's Disease Symptom Tracking,05/03/2025,"Mashrur Rashik, Shilpa Sweth, Nishtha Agrawal, Saiyyam Kochar, Kara M Smith, Fateme Rajabiyazdi, Vidya Setlur, Narges Mahyar, Ali Sarvghad","Journaling plays a crucial role in managing chronic conditions by allowing
patients to document symptoms and medication intake, providing essential data
for long-term care. While valuable, traditional journaling methods often rely
on static, self-directed entries, lacking interactive feedback and real-time

its usefulness for effective treatment. To address this gap, we introduce
PATRIKA, an AI-enabled prototype designed specifically for people with
Parkinson's disease (PwPD). The system incorporates cooperative conversation
principles, clinical interview simulations, and personalization to create a
more effective and user-friendly journaling experience. Through two user
studies with PwPD and iterative refinement of PATRIKA, we demonstrate

SafeVLA: Towards Safety Alignment of Vision-Language-Action Model via Safe Reinforcement Learning,05/03/2025,"Borong Zhang, Yuhao Zhang, Jiaming Ji, Yingshan Lei, Josef Dai, Yuanpei Chen, Yaodong Yang","Vision-language-action models (VLAs) have shown great potential as generalist
robot policies. However, these models pose urgent safety challenges during
deployment, including the risk of physical harm to the environment, the robot
itself, and humans. How can safety be explicitly incorporated into VLAs? In
this work, we propose SafeVLA, a novel algorithm designed to integrate safety
into VLAs, ensuring the protection of the environment, robot hardware and
humans in real-world settings. SafeVLA effectively balances safety and task
performance by employing large-scale constrained learning within simulated
environments. We demonstrate that SafeVLA outperforms the current
state-of-the-art method in both safety and task performance, achieving average
improvements of 83.58% and 3.85%, respectively, in simulation. By prioritizing
safety, our approach eliminates high-risk behaviors and reduces the upper bound
of unsafe behaviors to 1/35 of that in the current state-of-the-art, thereby
significantly mitigating long-tail risks. Furthermore, the learned safety
constraints generalize to diverse, unseen scenarios, including multiple

Predicting Practically? Domain Generalization for Predictive Analytics in Real-world Environments,05/03/2025,"Hanyu Duan, Yi Yang, Ahmed Abbasi, Kar Yan Tam","Predictive machine learning models are widely used in customer relationship
management (CRM) to forecast customer behaviors and support decision-making.
However, the dynamic nature of customer behaviors often results in significant
distribution shifts between training data and serving data, leading to
performance degradation in predictive models. Domain generalization, which aims
to train models that can generalize to unseen environments without prior
knowledge of their distributions, has become a critical area of research. In
this work, we propose a novel domain generalization method tailored to handle
complex distribution shifts, encompassing both covariate and concept shifts.
Our method builds upon the Distributionally Robust Optimization framework,
optimizing model performance over a set of hypothetical worst-case
distributions rather than relying solely on the training data. Through
simulation experiments, we demonstrate the working mechanism of the proposed
method. We also conduct experiments on a real-world customer churn dataset, and
validate its effectiveness in both temporal and spatial generalization
settings. Finally, we discuss the broader implications of our method for
advancing Information Systems (IS) design research, particularly in building
robust predictive models for dynamic managerial environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03399v1,,False
"Towards Understanding Multi-Round Large Language Model Reasoning: Approximability, Learnability and Generalizability",05/03/2025,"Chenhui Xu, Dancheng Liu, Jiajie Li, Amir Nassereldine, Zhaohui Li, Jinjun Xiong","Recent advancements in cognitive science and multi-round reasoning techniques
for Large Language Models (LLMs) suggest that iterative thinking processes
improve problem-solving performance in complex tasks. Inspired by this,
approaches like Chain-of-Thought, debating, and self-refinement have been
applied to auto-regressive LLMs, achieving significant successes in tasks such
as mathematical reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and multi-hop question
answering. Despite these successes, the theoretical basis for how multi-round
reasoning enhances problem-solving abilities remains underexplored. In this
work, we investigate the approximation, learnability, and generalization
properties of multi-round auto-regressive models. We show that Transformers
with finite context windows are universal approximators for steps of
Turing-computable functions and can approximate any Turing-computable
sequence-to-sequence function through multi-round reasoning. We extend PAC
learning to sequence generation and demonstrate that multi-round generation is
learnable even when the sequence length exceeds the model's context window.
Finally, we examine how generalization error propagates across rounds, and show
how the aforementioned approaches can help constrain this error, ensuring
outputs stay within an expectation boundary. This work sheds light on the
systemic theoretical foundations of multi-round sequence learning and
reasoning, emphasizing its role in inference complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.03128v1,,False
ArticuBot: Learning Universal Articulated Object Manipulation Policy via Large Scale Simulation,04/03/2025,"Yufei Wang, Ziyu Wang, Mino Nakura, Pratik Bhowal, Chia-Liang Kuo, Yi-Ting Chen, Zackory Erickson, David Held","This paper presents ArticuBot, in which a single learned policy enables a
robotics system to open diverse categories of unseen articulated objects in the
real world. This task has long been challenging for robotics due to the large
variations in the geometry, size, and articulation types of such objects. Our
system, Articubot, consists of three parts: generating a large number of
demonstrations in physics-based simulation, distilling all generated
demonstrations into a point cloud-based neural policy via imitation learning,
and performing zero-shot sim2real transfer to real robotics systems. Utilizing
sampling-based grasping and motion planning, our demonstration generalization
pipeline is fast and effective, generating a total of 42.3k demonstrations over
322 training articulated objects. For policy learning, we propose a novel
hierarchical policy representation, in which the high-level policy learns the
sub-goal for the end-effector, and the low-level policy learns how to move the
end-effector conditioned on the predicted goal. We demonstrate that this
hierarchical approach achieves much better object-level generalization compared
to the non-hierarchical version. We further propose a novel weighted
displacement model for the high-level policy that grounds the prediction into
the existing 3D structure of the scene, outperforming alternative policy
representations. We show that our learned policy can zero-shot transfer to
three different real robot settings: a fixed table-top Franka arm across two
different labs, and an X-Arm on a mobile base, opening multiple unseen
articulated objects across two labs, real lounges, and kitchens. Videos and

Generative assimilation and prediction for weather and climate,04/03/2025,"Shangshang Yang, Congyi Nai, Xinyan Liu, Weidong Li, Jie Chao, Jingnan Wang, Leyi Wang, Xichen Li, Xi Chen, Bo Lu, Ziniu Xiao, Niklas Boers, Huiling Yuan, Baoxiang Pan","Machine learning models have shown great success in predicting weather up to
two weeks ahead, outperforming process-based benchmarks. However, existing
approaches mostly focus on the prediction task, and do not incorporate the
necessary data assimilation. Moreover, these models suffer from error
accumulation in long roll-outs, limiting their applicability to seasonal
predictions or climate projections. Here, we introduce Generative Assimilation
and Prediction (GAP), a unified deep generative framework for assimilation and
prediction of both weather and climate. By learning to quantify the
probabilistic distribution of atmospheric states under observational,
predictive, and external forcing constraints, GAP excels in a broad range of
weather-climate related tasks, including data assimilation, seamless

Generative Active Adaptation for Drifting and Imbalanced Network Intrusion Detection,04/03/2025,"Ragini Gupta, Shinan Liu, Ruixiao Zhang, Xinyue Hu, Pranav Kommaraju, Xiaoyang Wang, Hadjer Benkraouda, Nick Feamster, Klara Nahrstedt","Machine learning has shown promise in network intrusion detection systems,
yet its performance often degrades due to concept drift and imbalanced data.
These challenges are compounded by the labor-intensive process of labeling
network traffic, especially when dealing with evolving and rare attack types,
which makes selecting the right data for adaptation difficult. To address these
issues, we propose a generative active adaptation framework that minimizes
labeling effort while enhancing model robustness. Our approach employs
density-aware active sampling to identify the most informative samples for
annotation and leverages deep generative models to synthesize diverse samples,
thereby augmenting the training set and mitigating the effects of concept
drift. We evaluate our end-to-end framework on both simulated IDS data and a
real-world ISP dataset, demonstrating significant improvements in intrusion
detection performance. Our method boosts the overall F1-score from 0.60

0.00, improve to 0.30, 0.50, and 0.71, respectively, with generative active
adaptation in the CIC-IDS 2018 dataset. Our framework effectively enhances rare

Robust time series generation via Schrödinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation,04/03/2025,"Alexandre Alouadi, Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier, Huyên Pham","We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr\""odinger Bridge (SB)
approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as
an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference
probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results
in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately
captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach
has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity
of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap
by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and
generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time

Diverse Controllable Diffusion Policy with Signal Temporal Logic,04/03/2025,"Yue Meng, Chuchu fan","Generating realistic simulations is critical for autonomous system
applications such as self-driving and human-robot interactions. However,
driving simulators nowadays still have difficulty in generating controllable,
diverse, and rule-compliant behaviors for road participants: Rule-based models
cannot produce diverse behaviors and require careful tuning, whereas
learning-based methods imitate the policy from data but are not designed to
follow the rules explicitly. Besides, the real-world datasets are by nature
""single-outcome"", making the learning method hard to generate diverse
behaviors. In this paper, we leverage Signal Temporal Logic (STL) and Diffusion
Models to learn controllable, diverse, and rule-aware policy. We first
calibrate the STL on the real-world data, then generate diverse synthetic data
using trajectory optimization, and finally learn the rectified diffusion policy
on the augmented dataset. We test on the NuScenes dataset and our approach can
achieve the most diverse rule-compliant trajectories compared to other
baselines, with a runtime 1/17X to the second-best approach. In the closed-loop
testing, our approach reaches the highest diversity, rule satisfaction rate,
and the least collision rate. Our method can generate varied characteristics
conditional on different STL parameters in testing. A case study on human-robot

Wikipedia in the Era of LLMs: Evolution and Risks,04/03/2025,"Siming Huang, Yuliang Xu, Mingmeng Geng, Yao Wan, Dongping Chen","In this paper, we present a thorough analysis of the impact of Large Language
Models (LLMs) on Wikipedia, examining the evolution of Wikipedia through
existing data and using simulations to explore potential risks. We begin by
analyzing page views and article content to study Wikipedia's recent changes
and assess the impact of LLMs. Subsequently, we evaluate how LLMs affect
various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks related to Wikipedia, including
machine translation and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Our findings and
simulation results reveal that Wikipedia articles have been influenced by LLMs,
with an impact of approximately 1%-2% in certain categories. If the machine
translation benchmark based on Wikipedia is influenced by LLMs, the scores of
the models may become inflated, and the comparative results among models might
shift as well. Moreover, the effectiveness of RAG might decrease if the
knowledge base becomes polluted by LLM-generated content. While LLMs have not
yet fully changed Wikipedia's language and knowledge structures, we believe
that our empirical findings signal the need for careful consideration of
potential future risks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02879v1,,False
(How) Do Language Models Track State?,04/03/2025,"Belinda Z. Li, Zifan Carl Guo, Jacob Andreas","Transformer language models (LMs) exhibit behaviors -- from storytelling to
code generation -- that appear to require tracking the unobserved state of an
evolving world. How do they do so? We study state tracking in LMs trained or
fine-tuned to compose permutations (i.e., to compute the order of a set of
objects after a sequence of swaps). Despite the simple algebraic structure of
this problem, many other tasks (e.g., simulation of finite automata and
evaluation of boolean expressions) can be reduced to permutation composition,
making it a natural model for state tracking in general. We show that LMs
consistently learn one of two state tracking mechanisms for this task. The
first closely resembles the ""associative scan"" construction used in recent
theoretical work by Liu et al. (2023) and Merrill et al. (2024). The second
uses an easy-to-compute feature (permutation parity) to partially prune the
space of outputs, then refines this with an associative scan. The two
mechanisms exhibit markedly different robustness properties, and we show how to
steer LMs toward one or the other with intermediate training tasks that
encourage or suppress the heuristics. Our results demonstrate that transformer
LMs, whether pretrained or fine-tuned, can learn to implement efficient and
interpretable state tracking mechanisms, and the emergence of these mechanisms
can be predicted and controlled.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02854v1,,False
SeqFusion: Sequential Fusion of Pre-Trained Models for Zero-Shot Time-Series Forecasting,04/03/2025,"Ting-Ji Huang, Xu-Yang Chen, Han-Jia Ye","Unlike traditional time-series forecasting methods that require extensive
in-task data for training, zero-shot forecasting can directly predict future
values given a target time series without additional training data. Current
zero-shot approaches primarily rely on pre-trained generalized models, with
their performance often depending on the variety and relevance of the
pre-training data, which can raise privacy concerns. Instead of collecting
diverse pre-training data, we introduce SeqFusion in this work, a novel
framework that collects and fuses diverse pre-trained models (PTMs)
sequentially for zero-shot forecasting. Based on the specific temporal
characteristics of the target time series, SeqFusion selects the most suitable
PTMs from a batch of pre-collected PTMs, performs sequential predictions, and
fuses all the predictions while using minimal data to protect privacy. Each of
these PTMs specializes in different temporal patterns and forecasting tasks,
allowing SeqFusion to select by measuring distances in a shared representation
space of the target time series with each PTM. Experiments demonstrate that
SeqFusion achieves competitive accuracy in zero-shot forecasting compared to
state-of-the-art methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02836v1,,False

Existing classifier-free guidance methods use a simple heuristic to mix

distributions. However, such methods do not approximate the intermediate
distributions, necessitating additional 'corrector' steps. In this work, we
provide an efficient and principled method for sampling from a sequence of

Q-Filters: Leveraging QK Geometry for Efficient KV Cache Compression,04/03/2025,"Nathan Godey, Alessio Devoto, Yu Zhao, Simone Scardapane, Pasquale Minervini, Éric de la Clergerie, Benoît Sagot","Autoregressive language models rely on a Key-Value (KV) Cache, which avoids
re-computing past hidden states during generation, making it faster. As model
sizes and context lengths grow, the KV Cache becomes a significant memory
bottleneck, which calls for compression methods that limit its size during
generation. In this paper, we discover surprising properties of Query (Q) and
Key (K) vectors that allow us to efficiently approximate attention scores
without computing the attention maps. We propose Q-Filters, a training-free KV
Cache compression method that filters out less crucial Key-Value pairs based on
a single context-agnostic projection. Contrarily to many alternatives,
Q-Filters is compatible with FlashAttention, as it does not require direct
access to attention weights. Experimental results in long-context settings
demonstrate that Q-Filters is competitive with attention-based compression
methods such as SnapKV in retrieval tasks while consistently outperforming
efficient compression schemes such as Streaming-LLM in generation setups.
Notably, Q-Filters achieves a 99% accuracy in the needle-in-a-haystack task

RAAD-LLM: Adaptive Anomaly Detection Using LLMs and RAG Integration,04/03/2025,"Alicia Russell-Gilbert, Sudip Mittal, Shahram Rahimi, Maria Seale, Joseph Jabour, Thomas Arnold, Joshua Church","Anomaly detection in complex industrial environments poses unique challenges,
particularly in contexts characterized by data sparsity and evolving
operational conditions. Predictive maintenance (PdM) in such settings demands
methodologies that are adaptive, transferable, and capable of integrating
domain-specific knowledge. In this paper, we present RAAD-LLM, a novel
framework for adaptive anomaly detection, leveraging large language models
(LLMs) integrated with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This approach
addresses the aforementioned PdM challenges. By effectively utilizing
domain-specific knowledge, RAAD-LLM enhances the detection of anomalies in time

Generative Modeling of Microweather Wind Velocities for Urban Air Mobility,04/03/2025,"Tristan A. Shah, Michael C. Stanley, James E. Warner","Motivated by the pursuit of safe, reliable, and weather-tolerant urban air
mobility (UAM) solutions, this work proposes a generative modeling approach for
characterizing microweather wind velocities. Microweather, or the weather
conditions in highly localized areas, is particularly complex in urban
environments owing to the chaotic and turbulent nature of wind flows.
Furthermore, traditional means of assessing local wind fields are not generally
viable solutions for UAM applications: 1) field measurements that would rely on
permanent wind profiling systems in operational air space are not practical, 2)
physics-based models that simulate fluid dynamics at a sufficiently high
resolution are not computationally tractable, and 3) data-driven modeling
approaches that are largely deterministic ignore the inherent variability in
turbulent flows that dictates UAM reliability. Thus, advancements in predictive
capabilities are needed to help mitigate the unique operational safety risks
that microweather winds pose for smaller, lighter weight UAM aircraft.
  This work aims to model microweather wind velocities in a manner that is
computationally-efficient, captures random variability, and would only require
a temporary, rather than permanent, field measurement campaign. Inspired by
recent breakthroughs in conditional generative AI such as text-to-image
generation, the proposed approach learns a probabilistic macro-to-microweather
mapping between regional weather forecasts and measured local wind velocities
using generative modeling (denoising diffusion probabilistic models, flow
matching, and Gaussian mixture models). A simple proof of concept was
implemented using a dataset comprised of local (micro) measurements from a
Sonic Detection and Ranging (SoDAR) wind profiler along with (macro) forecast
data from a nearby weather station over the same time period.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02690v1,,False
Cellular Automaton With CNN,04/03/2025,"Valery Ashu, Zhisong Liu, Heikki Haario, Andreas Rupp","Cellular automata (CA) models are widely used to simulate complex systems
with emergent behaviors, but identifying hidden parameters that govern their
dynamics remains a significant challenge. This study explores the use of
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to identify jump parameters in a
two-dimensional CA model. We propose a custom CNN architecture trained on
CA-generated data to classify jump parameters, which dictates the neighborhood
size and movement rules of cells within the CA. Experiments were conducted
across varying domain sizes (25 x 25 to 150 x 150) and CA iterations (0 to 50),
demonstrating that the accuracy improves with larger domain sizes, as they
provide more spatial information for parameter estimation. Interestingly, while
initial CA iterations enhance the performance, increasing the number of
iterations beyond a certain threshold does not significantly improve accuracy,
suggesting that only specific temporal information is relevant for parameter
identification. The proposed CNN achieves competitive accuracy (89.31) compared
to established architectures like LeNet-5 and AlexNet, while offering
significantly faster inference times, making it suitable for real-time
applications. This study highlights the potential of CNNs as a powerful tool
for fast and accurate parameter estimation in CA models, paving the way for
their use in more complex systems and higher-dimensional domains. Future work
will explore the identification of multiple hidden parameters and extend the
approach to three-dimensional CA models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02652v1,,False
Lightweight Channel-wise Dynamic Fusion Model: Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting via Entropy Analysis,04/03/2025,"Tianyu Jia, Zongxia Xie, Yanru Sun, Dilfira Kudrat, Qinghua Hu","Non-stationarity is an intrinsic property of real-world time series and plays
a crucial role in time series forecasting. Previous studies primarily adopt
instance normalization to attenuate the non-stationarity of original series for
better predictability. However, instance normalization that directly removes
the inherent non-stationarity can lead to three issues: (1) disrupting global
temporal dependencies, (2) ignoring channel-specific differences, and (3)
producing over-smoothed predictions. To address these issues, we theoretically
demonstrate that variance can be a valid and interpretable proxy for
quantifying non-stationarity of time series. Based on the analysis, we propose
a novel lightweight \textit{C}hannel-wise \textit{D}ynamic \textit{F}usion
\textit{M}odel (\textit{CDFM}), which selectively and dynamically recovers
intrinsic non-stationarity of the original series, while keeping the
predictability of normalized series. First, we design a Dual-Predictor Module,
which involves two branches: a Time Stationary Predictor for capturing stable
patterns and a Time Non-stationary Predictor for modeling global dynamics
patterns. Second, we propose a Fusion Weight Learner to dynamically
characterize the intrinsic non-stationary information across different samples
based on variance. Finally, we introduce a Channel Selector to selectively
recover non-stationary information from specific channels by evaluating their
non-stationarity, similarity, and distribution consistency, enabling the model
to capture relevant dynamic features and avoid overfitting. Comprehensive
experiments on seven time series datasets demonstrate the superiority and
generalization capabilities of CDFM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.02609v1,,False

Don't Get Too Excited -- Eliciting Emotions in LLMs,04/03/2025,"Gino Franco Fazzi, Julie Skoven Hinge, Stefan Heinrich, Paolo Burelli","This paper investigates the challenges of affect control in large language

Sparse Meets Dense: Unified Generative Recommendations with Cascaded Sparse-Dense Representations,04/03/2025,"Yuhao Yang, Zhi Ji, Zhaopeng Li, Yi Li, Zhonglin Mo, Yue Ding, Kai Chen, Zijian Zhang, Jie Li, Shuanglong Li, Lin Liu","Generative models have recently gained attention in recommendation systems by
directly predicting item identifiers from user interaction sequences. However,
existing methods suffer from significant information loss due to the separation

critical challenge. To address this, we introduce the Cascaded Organized
Bi-Represented generAtive retrieval (COBRA) framework, which innovatively
integrates sparse semantic IDs and dense vectors through a cascading process.
Our method alternates between generating these representations by first
generating sparse IDs, which serve as conditions to aid in the generation of
dense vectors. End-to-end training enables dynamic refinement of dense
representations, capturing both semantic insights and collaborative signals
from user-item interactions. During inference, COBRA employs a coarse-to-fine
strategy, starting with sparse ID generation and refining them into dense
vectors via the generative model. We further propose BeamFusion, an innovative
approach combining beam search with nearest neighbor scores to enhance
inference flexibility and recommendation diversity. Extensive experiments on

PersonaX: A Recommendation Agent Oriented User Modeling Framework for Long Behavior Sequence,04/03/2025,"Yunxiao Shi, Wujiang Xu, Zeqi Zhang, Xing Zi, Qiang Wu, Min Xu","Recommendation agents leverage large language models for user modeling LLM UM
to construct textual personas guiding alignment with real users. However
existing LLM UM methods struggle with long user generated content UGC due to
context limitations and performance degradation. To address this sampling
strategies prioritize relevance or recency are often applied yet they
inevitably neglect the diverse user interests embedded within the discarded
behaviors resulting in incomplete modeling and degraded profiling quality.
Furthermore relevance based sampling requires real time retrieval forcing the
user modeling process to operate online which introduces significant latency
overhead. In this paper we propose PersonaX an agent agnostic LLM UM framework
that tackles these challenges through sub behavior sequence SBS selection and
offline multi persona construction. PersonaX extracts compact SBS segments
offline to capture diverse user interests generating fine grained textual
personas that are cached for efficient online retrieval. This approach ensures
that the user persona used for prompting remains highly relevant to the current
context while eliminating the need for online user modeling. For SBS selection
we ensure both efficiency length less than five and high representational

Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and versatility of PersonaX in
high quality user profiling. Utilizing only 30 to 50 percent of the behavioral

significant activation in response to specific visual stimuli associated with
particular concepts. Precisely localizing these regions stands as a crucial
long-term goal in neuroscience to grasp essential brain functions and

Additionally, these stimuli often consist of concept objects in unnatural

algorithm presents compelling properties for policy learning. It summarizes
general dynamics knowledge about the environment and enables the prediction of
future outcomes of potential actions from past experience, reducing the
interaction with the environment through imagination training. In this paper, a
corridor TSC model is trained using the DreamerV3 algorithm to explore the
benefits of world models for TSC strategy learning. In RL environment design,
to manage congestion levels effectively, both the state and reward functions

smaller model size and initially attempting several medium training ratios can
significantly reduce the time spent on hyperparameter tuning. Additionally, we
found that the approach is generally applicable as it can solve two TSC task

This paper studies how LLMs are seemingly able to reflect more liberal versus

represented closer together. To do so, we probe the attention heads across the
layers of three open transformer-based LLMs (\texttt{Llama-2-7b-chat},
\texttt{Mistral-7b-instruct}, \texttt{Vicuna-7b}). We first prompt models to
generate text from the perspectives of different U.S.~lawmakers. We then
identify sets of attention heads whose activations linearly predict those
lawmakers' DW-NOMINATE scores, a widely-used and validated measure of political
ideology. We find that highly predictive heads are primarily located in the
middle layers, often speculated to encode high-level concepts and tasks. Using
probes only trained to predict lawmakers' ideology, we then show that the same
probes can predict measures of news outlets' slant from the activations of
models prompted to simulate text from those news outlets. These linear probes
allow us to visualize, interpret, and monitor ideological stances implicitly
adopted by an LLM as it generates open-ended responses. Finally, we demonstrate
that by applying linear interventions to these attention heads, we can steer
the model outputs toward a more liberal or conservative stance. Overall, our
research suggests that LLMs possess a high-level linear representation of

Code-as-Symbolic-Planner: Foundation Model-Based Robot Planning via Symbolic Code Generation,03/03/2025,"Yongchao Chen, Yilun Hao, Yang Zhang, Chuchu Fan","Recent works have shown great potentials of Large Language Models (LLMs) in
robot task and motion planning (TAMP). Current LLM approaches generate text- or
code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do
not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities.
Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints,
where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with
predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization
across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP
capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for
optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to
interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers,
planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still
leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round
guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner
improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across
seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows
strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous

Perceptual Motor Learning with Active Inference Framework for Robust Lateral Control,03/03/2025,"Elahe Delavari, John Moore, Junho Hong, Jaerock Kwon","This paper presents a novel Perceptual Motor Learning (PML) framework
integrated with Active Inference (AIF) to enhance lateral control in Highly

the seamless integration of perception and action, enabling efficient
decision-making in dynamic environments. Traditional autonomous driving

efficiency. In contrast, PML with AIF leverages a generative model to minimize
prediction error (""surprise"") and actively shape vehicle control based on
learned perceptual-motor representations. Our approach unifies deep learning
with active inference principles, allowing HAVs to perform lane-keeping
maneuvers with minimal data and without extensive retraining across different

with AIF enhances adaptability without increasing computational overhead while
achieving performance comparable to conventional methods. These findings

Using (Not so) Large Language Models for Generating Simulation Models in a Formal DSL -- A Study on Reaction Networks,03/03/2025,"Justin N. Kreikemeyer, Miłosz Jankowski, Pia Wilsdorf, Adelinde M. Uhrmacher","Formal languages are an integral part of modeling and simulation. They allow
the distillation of knowledge into concise simulation models amenable to

humanly accessible means of expressing models is through natural language,
which is not easily interpretable by computers. Here, we evaluate how a Large
Language Model (LLM) might be used for formalizing natural language into

domain-specific language, offering a self-hostable, compute-, and memory
efficient alternative. To this end, we develop a synthetic data generator to
serve as the basis for fine-tuning and evaluation. Our quantitative evaluation
shows that our fine-tuned Mistral model can recover the ground truth simulation
model in up to 84.5% of cases. In addition, our small-scale user study
demonstrates the model's practical potential for one-time generation as well as

motivation attempts to decouple exploration from external, task-based rewards.
However, established approaches to intrinsic motivation that follow general
principles such as information gain, often only uncover low-level interactions.
In contrast, children's play suggests that they engage in meaningful high-level
behavior by imitating or interacting with their caregivers. Recent work has

Primer C-VAE: An interpretable deep learning primer design method to detect emerging virus variants,03/03/2025,"Hanyu Wang, Emmanuel K. Tsinda, Anthony J. Dunn, Francis Chikweto, Alain B. Zemkoho","Motivation: PCR is more economical and quicker than Next Generation
Sequencing for detecting target organisms, with primer design being a critical
step. In epidemiology with rapidly mutating viruses, designing effective
primers is challenging. Traditional methods require substantial manual
intervention and struggle to ensure effective primer design across different

  Results: We developed Primer C-VAE, a model based on a Variational
Auto-Encoder framework with Convolutional Neural Networks to identify variants

For Alpha, Delta, and Omicron, our primer pairs produced fragments <200 bp,

organisms with longer gene sequences like E. coli and S. flexneri.
  Conclusion: Primer C-VAE is an interpretable deep learning approach for

Road Boundary Detection Using 4D mmWave Radar for Autonomous Driving,03/03/2025,"Yuyan Wu, Hae Young Noh","Detecting road boundaries, the static physical edges of the available driving

Traditionally, road boundary detection in autonomous driving relies on cameras

boundary detection method based on 4D mmWave radar which is cost-effective and
robust in complex driving scenarios. The main idea is that road boundaries
(e.g., fences, bushes, roadblocks), reflect millimeter waves, thus generating
point cloud data for the radar. To overcome the challenge that the 4D mmWave
radar point clouds contain many noisy points, we initially reduce noisy points
via physical constraints for road boundaries and then segment the road boundary
points from the noisy points by incorporating a distance-based loss which
penalizes for falsely detecting the points far away from the actual road
boundaries. In addition, we capture the temporal dynamics of point cloud
sequences by utilizing each point's deviation from the vehicle
motion-compensated road boundary detection result obtained from the previous
frame, along with the spatial distribution of the point cloud for point-wise
road boundary segmentation. We evaluated 4DRadarRBD through real-world driving
