A Deep Learning Framework for Sequence Mining with Bidirectional LSTM and Multi-Scale Attention,21/04/2025,"Tao Yang, Yu Cheng, Yaokun Ren, Yujia Lou, Minggu Wei, Honghui Xin","This paper addresses the challenges of mining latent patterns and modeling
contextual dependencies in complex sequence data. A sequence pattern mining
algorithm is proposed by integrating Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiLSTM) with a multi-scale attention mechanism. The BiLSTM captures both
forward and backward dependencies in sequences, enhancing the model's ability
to perceive global contextual structures. At the same time, the multi-scale
attention module assigns adaptive weights to key feature regions under
different window sizes. This improves the model's responsiveness to both local
and global important information. Extensive experiments are conducted on a
publicly available multivariate time series dataset. The proposed model is
compared with several mainstream sequence modeling methods. Results show that
it outperforms existing models in terms of accuracy, precision, and recall.
This confirms the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed architecture in
complex pattern recognition tasks. Further ablation studies and sensitivity
analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of attention scale and
input sequence length on model performance. These results provide empirical
support for structural optimization of the model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.15223v1,,False
A General Infrastructure and Workflow for Quadrotor Deep Reinforcement Learning and Reality Deployment,21/04/2025,"Kangyao Huang, Hao Wang, Yu Luo, Jingyu Chen, Jintao Chen, Xiangkui Zhang, Xiangyang Ji, Huaping Liu","Deploying robot learning methods to a quadrotor in unstructured outdoor
environments is an exciting task. Quadrotors operating in real-world
environments by learning-based methods encounter several challenges: a large
amount of simulator generated data required for training, strict demands for
real-time processing onboard, and the sim-to-real gap caused by dynamic and
noisy conditions. Current works have made a great breakthrough in applying
learning-based methods to end-to-end control of quadrotors, but rarely mention
the infrastructure system training from scratch and deploying to reality, which
makes it difficult to reproduce methods and applications. To bridge this gap,
we propose a platform that enables the seamless transfer of end-to-end deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) policies. We integrate the training environment,
flight dynamics control, DRL algorithms, the MAVROS middleware stack, and
hardware into a comprehensive workflow and architecture that enables
quadrotors' policies to be trained from scratch to real-world deployment in
several minutes. Our platform provides rich types of environments including
hovering, dynamic obstacle avoidance, trajectory tracking, balloon hitting, and
planning in unknown environments, as a physical experiment benchmark. Through
extensive empirical validation, we demonstrate the efficiency of proposed
sim-to-real platform, and robust outdoor flight performance under real-world
perturbations. Details can be found from our website

Learning Compositional Transferability of Time Series for Source-Free Domain Adaptation,21/04/2025,"Hankang Sun, Guiming Li, Su Yang, Baoqi Li","Domain adaptation is challenging for time series classification due to the
highly dynamic nature. This study tackles the most difficult subtask when both
target labels and source data are inaccessible, namely, source-free domain
adaptation. To reuse the classification backbone pre-trained on source data,
time series reconstruction is a sound solution that aligns target and source
time series by minimizing the reconstruction errors of both. However, simply
fine-tuning the source pre-trained reconstruction model on target data may lose
the learnt priori, and it struggles to accommodate domain varying temporal
patterns in a single encoder-decoder. Therefore, this paper tries to
disentangle the composition of domain transferability by using a compositional
architecture for time series reconstruction. Here, the preceding component is a
U-net frozen since pre-trained, the output of which during adaptation is the
initial reconstruction of a given target time series, acting as a coarse step
to prompt the subsequent finer adaptation. The following pipeline for finer
adaptation includes two parallel branches: The source replay branch using a
residual link to preserve the output of U-net, and the offset compensation
branch that applies an additional autoencoder (AE) to further warp U-net's
output. By deploying a learnable factor on either branch to scale their
composition in the final output of reconstruction, the data transferability is
disentangled and the learnt reconstructive capability from source data is
retained. During inference, aside from the batch-level optimization in the
training, we search at test time stability-aware rescaling of source replay
branch to tolerate instance-wise variation. The experimental results show that
such compositional architecture of time series reconstruction leads to SOTA
performance on 3 widely used benchmarks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14994v1,,False
EducationQ: Evaluating LLMs' Teaching Capabilities Through Multi-Agent Dialogue Framework,21/04/2025,"Yao Shi, Rongkeng Liang, Yong Xu","Large language models (LLMs) increasingly serve as educational tools, yet
evaluating their teaching capabilities remains challenging due to the
resource-intensive, context-dependent, and methodologically complex nature of
teacher-student interactions. We introduce EducationQ, a multi-agent dialogue
framework that efficiently assesses teaching capabilities through simulated
dynamic educational scenarios, featuring specialized agents for teaching,
learning, and evaluation. Testing 14 LLMs across major AI Organizations
(OpenAI, Meta, Google, Anthropic, and others) on 1,498 questions spanning 13
disciplines and 10 difficulty levels reveals that teaching effectiveness does
not correlate linearly with model scale or general reasoning capabilities -
with some smaller open-source models outperforming larger commercial
counterparts in teaching contexts. This finding highlights a critical gap in
current evaluations that prioritize knowledge recall over interactive pedagogy.
Our mixed-methods evaluation, combining quantitative metrics with qualitative
analysis and expert case studies, identifies distinct pedagogical strengths
employed by top-performing models (e.g., sophisticated questioning strategies,
adaptive feedback mechanisms). Human expert evaluations show 78% agreement with
our automated qualitative analysis of effective teaching behaviors, validating
our methodology. EducationQ demonstrates that LLMs-as-teachers require
specialized optimization beyond simple scaling, suggesting next-generation
educational AI prioritize targeted enhancement of specific pedagogical
effectiveness.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14928v1,,False
Latent Bayesian Optimization via Autoregressive Normalizing Flows,21/04/2025,"Seunghun Lee, Jinyoung Park, Jaewon Chu, Minseo Yoon, Hyunwoo J. Kim","Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been recognized for its effectiveness in
optimizing expensive and complex objective functions. Recent advancements in
Latent Bayesian Optimization (LBO) have shown promise by integrating generative
models such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) to manage the complexity of
high-dimensional and structured data spaces. However, existing LBO approaches
often suffer from the value discrepancy problem, which arises from the
reconstruction gap between input and latent spaces. This value discrepancy
problem propagates errors throughout the optimization process, leading to
suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we propose a Normalizing Flow-based
Bayesian Optimization (NF-BO), which utilizes normalizing flow as a generative
model to establish one-to-one encoding function from the input space to the
latent space, along with its left-inverse decoding function, eliminating the
reconstruction gap. Specifically, we introduce SeqFlow, an autoregressive
normalizing flow for sequence data. In addition, we develop a new candidate
sampling strategy that dynamically adjusts the exploration probability for each
token based on its importance. Through extensive experiments, our NF-BO method
demonstrates superior performance in molecule generation tasks, significantly
outperforming both traditional and recent LBO approaches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14889v1,,False
Exploring Collaborative GenAI Agents in Synchronous Group Settings: Eliciting Team Perceptions and Design Considerations for the Future of Work,21/04/2025,"Janet G. Johnson, Macarena Peralta, Mansanjam Kaur, Ruijie Sophia Huang, Sheng Zhao, Ruijia Guan, Shwetha Rajaram, Michael Nebeling","While generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is finding increased
adoption in workplaces, current tools are primarily designed for individual
use. Prior work established the potential for these tools to enhance personal
creativity and productivity towards shared goals; however, we don't know yet
how to best take into account the nuances of group work and team dynamics when
deploying GenAI in work settings. In this paper, we investigate the potential
of collaborative GenAI agents to augment teamwork in synchronous group settings
through an exploratory study that engaged 25 professionals across 6 teams in
speculative design workshops and individual follow-up interviews. Our workshops
included a mixed reality provotype to simulate embodied collaborative GenAI
agents capable of actively participating in group discussions. Our findings
suggest that, if designed well, collaborative GenAI agents offer valuable
opportunities to enhance team problem-solving by challenging groupthink,
bridging communication gaps, and reducing social friction. However, teams'
willingness to integrate GenAI agents depended on its perceived fit across a
number of individual, team, and organizational factors. We outline the key
design tensions around agent representation, social prominence, and engagement
and highlight the opportunities spatial and immersive technologies could offer
to modulate GenAI influence on team outcomes and strike a balance between
augmentation and agency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.14779v1,,False
