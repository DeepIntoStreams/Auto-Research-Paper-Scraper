Flow Matching Meets Biology and Life Science: A Survey,23/07/2025,"Zihao Li, Zhichen Zeng, Xiao Lin, Feihao Fang, Yanru Qu, Zhe Xu, Zhining Liu, Xuying Ning, Tianxin Wei, Ge Liu, Hanghang Tong, Jingrui He","Over the past decade, advances in generative modeling, such as generative
adversarial networks, masked autoencoders, and diffusion models, have
significantly transformed biological research and discovery, enabling
breakthroughs in molecule design, protein generation, drug discovery, and
beyond. At the same time, biological applications have served as valuable
testbeds for evaluating the capabilities of generative models. Recently, flow
matching has emerged as a powerful and efficient alternative to diffusion-based
generative modeling, with growing interest in its application to problems in
biology and life sciences. This paper presents the first comprehensive survey
of recent developments in flow matching and its applications in biological
domains. We begin by systematically reviewing the foundations and variants of
flow matching, and then categorize its applications into three major areas:
biological sequence modeling, molecule generation and design, and peptide and
protein generation. For each, we provide an in-depth review of recent progress.
We also summarize commonly used datasets and software tools, and conclude with
a discussion of potential future directions. The corresponding curated

"Physics-informed, boundary-constrained Gaussian process regression for the reconstruction of fluid flow fields",23/07/2025,"Adrian Padilla-Segarra, Pascal Noble, Olivier Roustant, Ã‰ric Savin","Gaussian process regression techniques have been used in fluid mechanics for
the reconstruction of flow fields from a reduction-of-dimension perspective. A
main ingredient in this setting is the construction of adapted covariance
functions, or kernels, to obtain such estimates. In this paper, we derive
physics-informed kernels for simulating two-dimensional velocity fields of an
incompressible (divergence-free) flow around aerodynamic profiles. These
kernels allow to define Gaussian process priors satisfying the
incompressibility condition and the prescribed boundary conditions along the
profile in a continuous manner. Such physical and boundary constraints can be
applied to any pre-defined scalar kernel in the proposed methodology, which is
very general and can be implemented with high flexibility for a broad range of
engineering applications. Its relevance and performances are illustrated by
numerical simulations of flows around a cylinder and a NACA 0412 airfoil
profile, for which no observation at the boundary is needed at all.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17582v1,,False
Enabling Cyber Security Education through Digital Twins and Generative AI,23/07/2025,"Vita Santa Barletta, Vito Bavaro, Miriana Calvano, Antonio Curci, Antonio Piccinno, Davide Pio Posa","Digital Twins (DTs) are gaining prominence in cybersecurity for their ability
to replicate complex IT (Information Technology), OT (Operational Technology),
and IoT (Internet of Things) infrastructures, allowing for real time
monitoring, threat analysis, and system simulation. This study investigates how
integrating DTs with penetration testing tools and Large Language Models (LLMs)
can enhance cybersecurity education and operational readiness. By simulating
realistic cyber environments, this approach offers a practical, interactive
framework for exploring vulnerabilities and defensive strategies. At the core
of this research is the Red Team Knife (RTK), a custom penetration testing
toolkit aligned with the Cyber Kill Chain model. RTK is designed to guide
learners through key phases of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance,
exploitation, and response within a DT powered ecosystem. The incorporation of
Large Language Models (LLMs) further enriches the experience by providing
intelligent, real-time feedback, natural language threat explanations, and
adaptive learning support during training exercises. This combined DT LLM
framework is currently being piloted in academic settings to develop hands on
skills in vulnerability assessment, threat detection, and security operations.
Initial findings suggest that the integration significantly improves the
effectiveness and relevance of cybersecurity training, bridging the gap between
theoretical knowledge and real-world application. Ultimately, the research
demonstrates how DTs and LLMs together can transform cybersecurity education to
meet evolving industry demands.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17518v1,,False
To Trust or Not to Trust: On Calibration in ML-based Resource Allocation for Wireless Networks,23/07/2025,"Rashika Raina, Nidhi Simmons, David E. Simmons, Michel Daoud Yacoub, Trung Q. Duong","In next-generation communications and networks, machine learning (ML) models
are expected to deliver not only accurate predictions but also well-calibrated
confidence scores that reflect the true likelihood of correct decisions. This
paper studies the calibration performance of an ML-based outage predictor
within a single-user, multi-resource allocation framework. We first establish
key theoretical properties of this system's outage probability (OP) under
perfect calibration. Importantly, we show that as the number of resources
grows, the OP of a perfectly calibrated predictor approaches the expected
output conditioned on it being below the classification threshold. In contrast,
when only one resource is available, the system's OP equals the model's overall
expected output. We then derive the OP conditions for a perfectly calibrated
predictor. These findings guide the choice of the classification threshold to
achieve a desired OP, helping system designers meet specific reliability
requirements. We also demonstrate that post-processing calibration cannot
improve the system's minimum achievable OP, as it does not introduce new
information about future channel states. Additionally, we show that
well-calibrated models are part of a broader class of predictors that
necessarily improve OP. In particular, we establish a monotonicity condition
that the accuracy-confidence function must satisfy for such improvement to
occur. To demonstrate these theoretical properties, we conduct a rigorous
simulation-based analysis using post-processing calibration techniques: Platt
scaling and isotonic regression. As part of this framework, the predictor is
trained using an outage loss function specifically designed for this system.
Furthermore, this analysis is performed on Rayleigh fading channels with
temporal correlation captured by Clarke's 2D model, which accounts for receiver
mobility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17494v1,,False
LTLZinc: a Benchmarking Framework for Continual Learning and Neuro-Symbolic Temporal Reasoning,23/07/2025,"Luca Salvatore Lorello, Nikolaos Manginas, Marco Lippi, Stefano Melacci","Neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence aims to combine neural architectures
with symbolic approaches that can represent knowledge in a human-interpretable
formalism. Continual learning concerns with agents that expand their knowledge
over time, improving their skills while avoiding to forget previously learned
concepts. Most of the existing approaches for neuro-symbolic artificial
intelligence are applied to static scenarios only, and the challenging setting
where reasoning along the temporal dimension is necessary has been seldom
explored. In this work we introduce LTLZinc, a benchmarking framework that can
be used to generate datasets covering a variety of different problems, against
which neuro-symbolic and continual learning methods can be evaluated along the
temporal and constraint-driven dimensions. Our framework generates expressive
temporal reasoning and continual learning tasks from a linear temporal logic
specification over MiniZinc constraints, and arbitrary image classification
datasets. Fine-grained annotations allow multiple neural and neuro-symbolic
training settings on the same generated datasets. Experiments on six
neuro-symbolic sequence classification and four class-continual learning tasks
generated by LTLZinc, demonstrate the challenging nature of temporal learning
and reasoning, and highlight limitations of current state-of-the-art methods.
We release the LTLZinc generator and ten ready-to-use tasks to the
neuro-symbolic and continual learning communities, in the hope of fostering
research towards unified temporal learning and reasoning frameworks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17482v1,,False
Demonstration of Efficient Predictive Surrogates for Large-scale Quantum Processors,23/07/2025,"Wei-You Liao, Yuxuan Du, Xinbiao Wang, Tian-Ci Tian, Yong Luo, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao, He-Liang Huang","The ongoing development of quantum processors is driving breakthroughs in
scientific discovery. Despite this progress, the formidable cost of fabricating
large-scale quantum processors means they will remain rare for the foreseeable
future, limiting their widespread application. To address this bottleneck, we
introduce the concept of predictive surrogates, which are classical learning
models designed to emulate the mean-value behavior of a given quantum processor
with provably computational efficiency. In particular, we propose two
predictive surrogates that can substantially reduce the need for quantum
processor access in diverse practical scenarios. To demonstrate their potential
in advancing digital quantum simulation, we use these surrogates to emulate a
quantum processor with up to 20 programmable superconducting qubits, enabling
efficient pre-training of variational quantum eigensolvers for families of
transverse-field Ising models and identification of non-equilibrium Floquet
symmetry-protected topological phases. Experimental results reveal that the
predictive surrogates not only reduce measurement overhead by orders of
magnitude, but can also surpass the performance of conventional,
quantum-resource-intensive approaches. Collectively, these findings establish
predictive surrogates as a practical pathway to broadening the impact of
advanced quantum processors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17470v1,,False
C3RL: Rethinking the Combination of Channel-independence and Channel-mixing from Representation Learning,23/07/2025,"Shusen Ma, Yun-Bo Zhao, Yu Kang","Multivariate time series forecasting has drawn increasing attention due to
its practical importance. Existing approaches typically adopt either
channel-mixing (CM) or channel-independence (CI) strategies. CM strategy can
capture inter-variable dependencies but fails to discern variable-specific
temporal patterns. CI strategy improves this aspect but fails to fully exploit
cross-variable dependencies like CM. Hybrid strategies based on feature fusion
offer limited generalization and interpretability. To address these issues, we
propose C3RL, a novel representation learning framework that jointly models
both CM and CI strategies. Motivated by contrastive learning in computer
vision, C3RL treats the inputs of the two strategies as transposed views and
builds a siamese network architecture: one strategy serves as the backbone,
while the other complements it. By jointly optimizing contrastive and
prediction losses with adaptive weighting, C3RL balances representation and
forecasting performance. Extensive experiments on seven models show that C3RL
boosts the best-case performance rate to 81.4\% for models based on CI strategy
and to 76.3\% for models based on CM strategy, demonstrating strong
generalization and effectiveness. The code will be available once the paper is
accepted.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17454v1,,False
Reasoning-Driven Retrosynthesis Prediction with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning,23/07/2025,"Situo Zhang, Hanqi Li, Lu Chen, Zihan Zhao, Xuanze Lin, Zichen Zhu, Bo Chen, Xin Chen, Kai Yu","Retrosynthesis planning, essential in organic synthesis and drug discovery,
has greatly benefited from recent AI-driven advancements. Nevertheless,
existing methods frequently face limitations in both applicability and
explainability. Traditional graph-based and sequence-to-sequence models often
lack generalized chemical knowledge, leading to predictions that are neither
consistently accurate nor easily explainable. To address these challenges, we
introduce RetroDFM-R, a reasoning-based large language model (LLM) designed
specifically for chemical retrosynthesis. Leveraging large-scale reinforcement
learning guided by chemically verifiable rewards, RetroDFM-R significantly
enhances prediction accuracy and explainability. Comprehensive evaluations
demonstrate that RetroDFM-R significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving a top-1 accuracy of 65.0% on the USPTO-50K benchmark. Double-blind
human assessments further validate the chemical plausibility and practical
utility of RetroDFM-R's predictions. RetroDFM-R also accurately predicts
multistep retrosynthetic routes reported in the literature for both real-world
drug molecules and perovskite materials. Crucially, the model's explicit
reasoning process provides human-interpretable insights, thereby enhancing
trust and practical value in real-world retrosynthesis applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17448v1,,False
Ctx2TrajGen: Traffic Context-Aware Microscale Vehicle Trajectories using Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning,23/07/2025,"Joobin Jin, Seokjun Hong, Gyeongseon Baek, Yeeun Kim, Byeongjoon Noh","Precise modeling of microscopic vehicle trajectories is critical for traffic
behavior analysis and autonomous driving systems. We propose Ctx2TrajGen, a
context-aware trajectory generation framework that synthesizes realistic urban
driving behaviors using GAIL. Leveraging PPO and WGAN-GP, our model addresses
nonlinear interdependencies and training instability inherent in microscopic
settings. By explicitly conditioning on surrounding vehicles and road geometry,
Ctx2TrajGen generates interaction-aware trajectories aligned with real-world
context. Experiments on the drone-captured DRIFT dataset demonstrate superior
performance over existing methods in terms of realism, behavioral diversity,
and contextual fidelity, offering a robust solution to data scarcity and domain

Learning from Scratch: Structurally-masked Transformer for Next Generation Lib-free Simulation,23/07/2025,"Junlang Huang, Hao Chen, Zhong Guan","This paper proposes a neural framework for power and timing prediction of
multi-stage data path, distinguishing itself from traditional lib-based
analytical methods dependent on driver characterization and load
simplifications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
language-based, netlist-aware neural network designed explicitly for standard
cells. Our approach employs two pre-trained neural models of waveform
prediction and delay estimation that directly infer transient waveforms and
propagation delays from SPICE netlists, conditioned on critical physical
parameters such as load capacitance, input slew, and gate size. This method
accurately captures both intrinsic and coupling-induced delay effects without
requiring simplification or interpolation. For multi-stage timing prediction,
we implement a recursive propagation strategy where predicted waveforms from
each stage feed into subsequent stages, cumulatively capturing delays across
the logic chain. This approach ensures precise timing alignment and complete
waveform visibility throughout complex signal pathways. The waveform prediction
utilizes a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture with netlist-aware node-level
encoding, addressing traditional Transformers' fixed input dimensionality
constraints. Additionally, specialized subnetworks separately handle primary
delay estimation and crosstalk correction. Experimental results demonstrate
SPICE-level accuracy, consistently achieving RMSE below 0.0098 across diverse
industrial circuits. The proposed framework provides a scalable, structurally
adaptable neural alternative to conventional power and timing engines,
demonstrating high fidelity to physical circuit behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17396v1,,False
HiProbe-VAD: Video Anomaly Detection via Hidden States Probing in Tuning-Free Multimodal LLMs,23/07/2025,"Zhaolin Cai, Fan Li, Ziwei Zheng, Yanjun Qin","Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) aims to identify and locate deviations from
normal patterns in video sequences. Traditional methods often struggle with
substantial computational demands and a reliance on extensive labeled datasets,
thereby restricting their practical applicability. To address these
constraints, we propose HiProbe-VAD, a novel framework that leverages
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for VAD without requiring
fine-tuning. In this paper, we discover that the intermediate hidden states of
MLLMs contain information-rich representations, exhibiting higher sensitivity
and linear separability for anomalies compared to the output layer. To
capitalize on this, we propose a Dynamic Layer Saliency Probing (DLSP)
mechanism that intelligently identifies and extracts the most informative
hidden states from the optimal intermediate layer during the MLLMs reasoning.
Then a lightweight anomaly scorer and temporal localization module efficiently
detects anomalies using these extracted hidden states and finally generate
explanations. Experiments on the UCF-Crime and XD-Violence datasets demonstrate
that HiProbe-VAD outperforms existing training-free and most traditional
approaches. Furthermore, our framework exhibits remarkable cross-model
generalization capabilities in different MLLMs without any tuning, unlocking
the potential of pre-trained MLLMs for video anomaly detection and paving the
way for more practical and scalable solutions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17394v1,,False
Continual Generalized Category Discovery: Learning and Forgetting from a Bayesian Perspective,23/07/2025,"Hao Dai, Jagmohan Chauhan","Continual Generalized Category Discovery (C-GCD) faces a critical challenge:
incrementally learning new classes from unlabeled data streams while preserving
knowledge of old classes. Existing methods struggle with catastrophic
forgetting, especially when unlabeled data mixes known and novel categories. We
address this by analyzing C-GCD's forgetting dynamics through a Bayesian lens,
revealing that covariance misalignment between old and new classes drives
performance degradation. Building on this insight, we propose Variational Bayes
C-GCD (VB-CGCD), a novel framework that integrates variational inference with
covariance-aware nearest-class-mean classification. VB-CGCD adaptively aligns
class distributions while suppressing pseudo-label noise via stochastic
variational updates. Experiments show VB-CGCD surpasses prior art by +15.21%
with the overall accuracy in the final session on standard benchmarks. We also
introduce a new challenging benchmark with only 10% labeled data and extended
online phases, VB-CGCD achieves a 67.86% final accuracy, significantly higher
than state-of-the-art (38.55%), demonstrating its robust applicability across
diverse scenarios. Code is available at: https://github.com/daihao42/VB-CGCD",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17382v1,,False
R-Stitch: Dynamic Trajectory Stitching for Efficient Reasoning,23/07/2025,"Zhuokun Chen, Zeren Chen, Jiahao He, Mingkui Tan, Jianfei Cai, Bohan Zhuang","Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning enhances the problem-solving capabilities of
large language models by encouraging step-by-step intermediate reasoning during
inference. While effective, CoT introduces substantial computational overhead
due to its reliance on autoregressive decoding over long token sequences.
Existing acceleration strategies either reduce sequence length through early
stopping or compressive reward designs, or improve decoding speed via
speculative decoding with smaller models. However, speculative decoding suffers
from limited speedup when the agreement between small and large models is low,
and fails to exploit the potential advantages of small models in producing
concise intermediate reasoning. In this paper, we present R-Stitch, a
token-level, confidence-based hybrid decoding framework that accelerates CoT
inference by switching between a small language model (SLM) and a large
language model (LLM) along the reasoning trajectory. R-Stitch uses the SLM to
generate tokens by default and delegates to the LLM only when the SLM's
confidence falls below a threshold. This design avoids full-sequence rollback
and selectively invokes the LLM on uncertain steps, preserving both efficiency
and answer quality. R-Stitch is model-agnostic, training-free, and compatible
with standard decoding pipelines. Experiments on math reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that R-Stitch achieves up to 85\% reduction in inference latency
with negligible accuracy drop, highlighting its practical effectiveness in
accelerating CoT reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17307v1,,False
Prolonging Tool Life: Learning Skillful Use of General-purpose Tools through Lifespan-guided Reinforcement Learning,23/07/2025,"Po-Yen Wu, Cheng-Yu Kuo, Yuki Kadokawa, Takamitsu Matsubara","In inaccessible environments with uncertain task demands, robots often rely
on general-purpose tools that lack predefined usage strategies. These tools are
not tailored for particular operations, making their longevity highly sensitive
to how they are used. This creates a fundamental challenge: how can a robot
learn a tool-use policy that both completes the task and prolongs the tool's
lifespan? In this work, we address this challenge by introducing a
reinforcement learning (RL) framework that incorporates tool lifespan as a
factor during policy optimization. Our framework leverages Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) and Miner's Rule to estimate Remaining Useful Life (RUL) based
on accumulated stress, and integrates the RUL into the RL reward to guide
policy learning toward lifespan-guided behavior. To handle the fact that RUL
can only be estimated after task execution, we introduce an Adaptive Reward
Normalization (ARN) mechanism that dynamically adjusts reward scaling based on
estimated RULs, ensuring stable learning signals. We validate our method across
simulated and real-world tool use tasks, including Object-Moving and
Door-Opening with multiple general-purpose tools. The learned policies
consistently prolong tool lifespan (up to 8.01x in simulation) and transfer
effectively to real-world settings, demonstrating the practical value of
learning lifespan-guided tool use strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17275v1,,False
Leveraging Knowledge Graphs and LLM Reasoning to Identify Operational Bottlenecks for Warehouse Planning Assistance,23/07/2025,"Rishi Parekh, Saisubramaniam Gopalakrishnan, Zishan Ahmad, Anirudh Deodhar","Analyzing large, complex output datasets from Discrete Event Simulations
(DES) of warehouse operations to identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies is a
critical yet challenging task, often demanding significant manual effort or
specialized analytical tools. Our framework integrates Knowledge Graphs (KGs)

Simulation (DES) output data from warehouse operations. It transforms raw DES
data into a semantically rich KG, capturing relationships between simulation
events and entities. An LLM-based agent uses iterative reasoning, generating
interdependent sub-questions. For each sub-question, it creates Cypher queries
for KG interaction, extracts information, and self-reflects to correct errors.
This adaptive, iterative, and self-correcting process identifies operational
issues mimicking human analysis. Our DES approach for warehouse bottleneck
identification, tested with equipment breakdowns and process irregularities,
outperforms baseline methods. For operational questions, it achieves
near-perfect pass rates in pinpointing inefficiencies. For complex

structured guidance through predefined prompts. We evaluated the tool via an
experiment with 136 students from an introductory programming course at a large
German university and analyzed how students interacted with SCRIPT while
solving programming tasks with a focus on their feedback preferences. The
results reveal that students' feedback requests seem to follow a specific

Eco-Friendly AI: Unleashing Data Power for Green Federated Learning,23/07/2025,"Mattia Sabella, Monica Vitali","The widespread adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning
(ML) comes with a significant environmental impact, particularly in terms of
energy consumption and carbon emissions. This pressing issue highlights the
need for innovative solutions to mitigate AI's ecological footprint. One of the
key factors influencing the energy consumption of ML model training is the size
of the training dataset. ML models are often trained on vast amounts of data
continuously generated by sensors and devices distributed across multiple
locations. To reduce data transmission costs and enhance privacy, Federated
Learning (FL) enables model training without the need to move or share raw
data. While FL offers these advantages, it also introduces challenges due to
the heterogeneity of data sources (related to volume and quality),
computational node capabilities, and environmental impact.
  This paper contributes to the advancement of Green AI by proposing a
data-centric approach to Green Federated Learning. Specifically, we focus on
reducing FL's environmental impact by minimizing the volume of training data.
Our methodology involves the analysis of the characteristics of federated
datasets, the selecting of an optimal subset of data based on quality metrics,
and the choice of the federated nodes with the lowest environmental impact. We
develop a comprehensive methodology that examines the influence of data-centric
factors, such as data quality and volume, on FL training performance and carbon
emissions. Building on these insights, we introduce an interactive
recommendation system that optimizes FL configurations through data reduction,
minimizing environmental impact during training. Applying this methodology to
time series classification has demonstrated promising results in reducing the

roles, the design reviewer, who identifies design-related issues, and the
design contributor who corrects them. This decomposition enables an iterative
loop where the reviewer continuously detects issues and the contributor
corrects them, allowing a draft to be further polished with each iteration,
reaching qualities that were unattainable. We fine-tune large language models
for these roles and simulate intermediate drafts by introducing controlled

LLM Meets the Sky: Heuristic Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning for Secure Heterogeneous UAV Networks,23/07/2025,"Lijie Zheng, Ji He, Shih Yu Chang, Yulong Shen, Dusit Niyato","This work tackles the physical layer security (PLS) problem of maximizing the
secrecy rate in heterogeneous UAV networks (HetUAVNs) under propulsion energy

overlook energy-security trade-offs, we consider a realistic scenario where
UAVs with diverse payloads and computation resources collaborate to serve
ground terminals in the presence of eavesdroppers. To manage the complex

PICore: Physics-Informed Unsupervised Coreset Selection for Data Efficient Neural Operator Training,23/07/2025,"Anirudh Satheesh, Anant Khandelwal, Mucong Ding, Radu Balan","Neural operators offer a powerful paradigm for solving partial differential
equations (PDEs) that cannot be solved analytically by learning mappings

neural operators: they require a significant amount of training data to learn
these mappings, and this data needs to be labeled, which can only be accessed
via expensive simulations with numerical solvers. To alleviate both of these
issues simultaneously, we propose PICore, an unsupervised coreset selection
framework that identifies the most informative training samples without
requiring access to ground-truth PDE solutions. PICore leverages a
physics-informed loss to select unlabeled inputs by their potential
contribution to operator learning. After selecting a compact subset of inputs,
only those samples are simulated using numerical solvers to generate labels,
reducing annotation costs. We then train the neural operator on the reduced
labeled dataset, significantly decreasing training time as well. Across four
diverse PDE benchmarks and multiple coreset selection strategies, PICore
achieves up to 78% average increase in training efficiency relative to
supervised coreset selection methods with minimal changes in accuracy. We

Weather-Aware AI Systems versus Route-Optimization AI: A Comprehensive Analysis of AI Applications in Transportation Productivity,23/07/2025,Tatsuru Kikuchi,"While recent research demonstrates that AI route-optimization systems improve
taxi driver productivity by 14\%, this study reveals that such findings capture
only a fraction of AI's potential in transportation. We examine comprehensive
weather-aware AI systems that integrate deep learning meteorological prediction
with machine learning positioning optimization, comparing their performance
against traditional operations and route-only AI approaches. Using simulation
data from 10,000 taxi operations across varied weather conditions, we find that
weather-aware AI systems increase driver revenue by 107.3\%, compared to 14\%
improvements from route-optimization alone. Weather prediction contributes the
largest individual productivity gain, with strong correlations between
meteorological conditions and demand ($r=0.575$). Economic analysis reveals
annual earnings increases of 13.8 million yen per driver, with rapid payback
periods and superior return on investment. These findings suggest that current
AI literature significantly underestimates AI's transformative potential by
focusing narrowly on routing algorithms, while weather intelligence represents
