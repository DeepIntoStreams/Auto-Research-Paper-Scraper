techniques to extract non-Gaussian information from cosmological large-scale
structure. This work presents the first simulation-based inference (SBI)
pipeline that combines weak lensing and galaxy clustering maps in a realistic
Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (DES Y3) configuration and serves as preparation for
a forthcoming analysis of the survey data. We develop a scalable forward model
based on the CosmoGridV1 suite of N-body simulations to generate over one
million self-consistent mock realizations of DES Y3 at the map level.
Leveraging this large dataset, we train deep graph convolutional neural
networks on the full survey footprint in spherical geometry to learn
low-dimensional features that approximately maximize mutual information with
target parameters. These learned compressions enable neural density estimation
of the implicit likelihood via normalizing flows in a ten-dimensional parameter
space spanning cosmological $w$CDM, intrinsic alignment, and linear galaxy bias
parameters, while marginalizing over baryonic, photometric redshift, and shear
bias nuisances. To ensure robustness, we extensively validate our inference
pipeline using synthetic observations derived from both systematic
contaminations in our forward model and independent Buzzard galaxy catalogs.
Our forecasts yield significant improvements in cosmological parameter
constraints, achieving $2-3\times$ higher figures of merit in the $\Omega_m -
S_8$ plane relative to our implementation of baseline two-point statistics and
effectively breaking parameter degeneracies through probe combination. These
results demonstrate the potential of SBI analyses powered by deep learning for
upcoming Stage-IV wide-field imaging surveys.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04681v1,,False
TT-Prune: Joint Model Pruning and Resource Allocation for Communication-efficient Time-triggered Federated Learning,06/11/2025,"Xinlu Zhang, Yansha Deng, Toktam Mahmoodi","Federated learning (FL) offers new opportunities in machine learning,
particularly in addressing data privacy concerns. In contrast to conventional
event-based federated learning, time-triggered federated learning (TT-Fed), as
a general form of both asynchronous and synchronous FL, clusters users into
different tiers based on fixed time intervals. However, the FL network consists
of a growing number of user devices with limited wireless bandwidth,
consequently magnifying issues such as stragglers and communication overhead.
In this paper, we introduce adaptive model pruning to wireless TT-Fed systems
and study the problem of jointly optimizing the pruning ratio and bandwidth
allocation to minimize the training loss while ensuring minimal learning
latency. To answer this question, we perform convergence analysis on the
gradient l_2 norm of the TT-Fed model based on model pruning. Based on the
obtained convergence upper bound, a joint optimization problem of pruning ratio
and wireless bandwidth is formulated to minimize the model training loss under
a given delay threshold. Then, we derive closed-form solutions for wireless
bandwidth and pruning ratio using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker(KKT) conditions. The
simulation results show that model pruning could reduce the communication cost
by 40% while maintaining the model performance at the same level.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04653v1,,False
Optimal Inference Schedules for Masked Diffusion Models,06/11/2025,"Sitan Chen, Kevin Cong, Jerry Li","A major bottleneck of standard auto-regressive large language models is that
their inference process is inherently sequential, resulting in very long and
costly inference times. To circumvent this, practitioners proposed a class of
language models called diffusion language models, of which the masked diffusion
model (MDM) is the most successful. The MDM is able to sample tokens
out-of-order and, ostensibly, many tokens at once and in parallel. However,
there is very limited rigorous understanding of how much parallel sampling
these models can perform without noticeable degradation in their sampling
performance. Prior work of Li and Cai obtained some preliminary bounds, but
these are not tight for many natural classes of distributions. In this work, we
give a new, exact characterization of the expected divergence between the true
distribution and the sampled distribution, for any distribution and any
unmasking schedule for the sampler, showing an elegant connection to the theory
of univariate function approximation.
  By leveraging this connection, we then attain a number of novel lower and
upper bounds for this problem. While the connection to function approximation
in principle gives the optimal unmasking schedule for any distribution, we show
that it is in general impossible to compete with it without strong a priori
knowledge of the distribution, even in seemingly benign settings. However, we
also demonstrate new upper bounds and new sampling schedules in terms of
well-studied information-theoretic properties of the base distribution, namely,
its total correlation and dual total correlation, which show that in some
natural settings, one can sample in $O(log n)$ steps without any visible loss
in performance, where $n$ is the total sequence length.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04647v1,,False
Efficient probabilistic surrogate modeling techniques for partially-observed large-scale dynamical systems,06/11/2025,"Hans Harder, Abhijeet Vishwasrao, Luca Guastoni, Ricardo Vinuesa, Sebastian Peitz","This paper is concerned with probabilistic techniques for forecasting
dynamical systems described by partial differential equations (such as, for
example, the Navier-Stokes equations). In particular, it is investigating and
comparing various extensions to the flow matching paradigm that reduce the
number of sampling steps. In this regard, it compares direct distillation,
progressive distillation, adversarial diffusion distillation, Wasserstein GANs
and rectified flows. Moreover, experiments are conducted on a set of
challenging systems. In particular, we also address the challenge of directly
predicting 2D slices of large-scale 3D simulations, paving the way for
efficient inflow generation for solvers.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04641v1,,False
Machine Learning for Electron-Scale Turbulence Modeling in W7-X,06/11/2025,"Ionut-Gabriel Farcas, Don Lawrence Carl Agapito Fernando, Alejandro Banon Navarro, Gabriele Merlo, Frank Jenko","Constructing reduced models for turbulent transport is essential for
accelerating profile predictions and enabling many-query tasks such as
uncertainty quantification, parameter scans, and design optimization. This
paper presents machine-learning-driven reduced models for Electron Temperature
Gradient (ETG) turbulence in the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) stellarator. Each model
predicts the ETG heat flux as a function of three plasma parameters: the
normalized electron temperature radial gradient ($\omega_{T_e}$), the ratio of
normalized electron temperature and density radial gradients ($\eta_e$), and
the electron-to-ion temperature ratio ($\tau$). We first construct models
across seven radial locations using regression and an active
machine-learning-based procedure. This process initializes models using
low-cardinality sparse-grid training data and then iteratively refines their
training sets by selecting the most informative points from a pre-existing
simulation database. We evaluate the prediction capabilities of our models
using out-of-sample datasets with over $393$ points per location, and $95\%$
prediction intervals are estimated via bootstrapping to assess prediction
uncertainty. We then investigate the construction of generalized reduced
models, including a generic, position-independent model, and assess their heat
flux prediction capabilities at three additional locations. Our models
demonstrate robust performance and predictive accuracy comparable to the
original reference simulations, even when applied beyond the training domain.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04567v1,,False
Optimizing Sensor Placement in Urban Storm Sewers: A Data-Driven Sparse Sensing Approach,06/11/2025,"Zihang Ding, Kun Zhang","Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming
drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood
prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired,
practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full
implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow
conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents
a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to
optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater
system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case
study. We utilized a SWMM model to generate a training dataset of peak flowrate
profiles across the stormwater network. Furthermore, we applied DSS -
leveraging singular value decomposition for dimensionality reduction and QR
factorization for sensor allocation - to identify the optimal monitoring nodes
based on the simulated training dataset. We then validated the
representativeness of these identified monitoring nodes by comparing the
DSS-reconstructed peak flowrate profiles with those obtained from SWMM. Three
optimally placed sensors among 77 nodes achieved satisfactory reconstruction
performance with Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) values of 0.92-0.95 (25th to
75th percentiles). In addition, the model showed good robustness to uncertainty
in measurements. Its robustness to sensor failures is location-dependent and
improves with the number of sensors deployed. The framework balances
computational efficiency and physical interpretability, enabling high-accuracy
flow reconstruction with minimal sensors. This DSS framework can be further
integrated with predictive models to realize flood early warning and real-time
control under limited sensing and monitoring resource.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04556v1,,False
Generative Bayesian Filtering and Parameter Learning,06/11/2025,"Edoardo Marcelli, Sean O'Hagan, Veronika Rockova","Generative Bayesian Filtering (GBF) provides a powerful and flexible
framework for performing posterior inference in complex nonlinear and
non-Gaussian state-space models. Our approach extends Generative Bayesian
Computation (GBC) to dynamic settings, enabling recursive posterior inference
using simulation-based methods powered by deep neural networks. GBF does not
require explicit density evaluations, making it particularly effective when
observation or transition distributions are analytically intractable. To
address parameter learning, we introduce the Generative-Gibbs sampler, which
bypasses explicit density evaluation by iteratively sampling each variable from
its implicit full conditional distribution. Such technique is broadly
applicable and enables inference in hierarchical Bayesian models with
intractable densities, including state-space models. We assess the performance
of the proposed methodologies through both simulated and empirical studies,
including the estimation of $\alpha$-stable stochastic volatility models. Our
findings indicate that GBF significantly outperforms existing likelihood-free
approaches in accuracy and robustness when dealing with intractable state-space
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04552v1,,False
Uncertainty Quantification for Reduced-Order Surrogate Models Applied to Cloud Microphysics,06/11/2025,"Jonas E. Katona, Emily K. de Jong, Nipun Gunawardena","Reduced-order models (ROMs) can efficiently simulate high-dimensional
physical systems, but lack robust uncertainty quantification methods. Existing
approaches are frequently architecture- or training-specific, which limits
flexibility and generalization. We introduce a post hoc, model-agnostic
framework for predictive uncertainty quantification in latent space ROMs that
requires no modification to the underlying architecture or training procedure.
Using conformal prediction, our approach estimates statistical prediction
intervals for multiple components of the ROM pipeline: latent dynamics,
reconstruction, and end-to-end predictions. We demonstrate the method on a
latent space dynamical model for cloud microphysics, where it accurately
predicts the evolution of droplet-size distributions and quantifies uncertainty
across the ROM pipeline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04534v1,,False
Large language models replicate and predict human cooperation across experiments in game theory,06/11/2025,"Andrea Cera Palatsi, Samuel Martin-Gutierrez, Ana S. Cardenal, Max Pellert","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used both to make decisions in
domains such as health, education and law, and to simulate human behavior. Yet
how closely LLMs mirror actual human decision-making remains poorly understood.
This gap is critical: misalignment could produce harmful outcomes in practical
applications, while failure to replicate human behavior renders LLMs
ineffective for social simulations. Here, we address this gap by developing a
digital twin of game-theoretic experiments and introducing a systematic
prompting and probing framework for machine-behavioral evaluation. Testing
three open-source models (Llama, Mistral and Qwen), we find that Llama
reproduces human cooperation patterns with high fidelity, capturing human
deviations from rational choice theory, while Qwen aligns closely with Nash
equilibrium predictions. Notably, we achieved population-level behavioral
replication without persona-based prompting, simplifying the simulation
process. Extending beyond the original human-tested games, we generate and
preregister testable hypotheses for novel game configurations outside the
original parameter grid. Our findings demonstrate that appropriately calibrated
LLMs can replicate aggregate human behavioral patterns and enable systematic
exploration of unexplored experimental spaces, offering a complementary
approach to traditional research in the social and behavioral sciences that
generates new empirical predictions about human social decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04500v1,,False
Towards Causal Market Simulators,06/11/2025,"Dennis Thumm, Luis Ontaneda Mijares","Market generators using deep generative models have shown promise for
synthetic financial data generation, but existing approaches lack causal
reasoning capabilities essential for counterfactual analysis and risk
assessment. We propose a Time-series Neural Causal Model VAE (TNCM-VAE) that
combines variational autoencoders with structural causal models to generate
counterfactual financial time series while preserving both temporal
dependencies and causal relationships. Our approach enforces causal constraints
through directed acyclic graphs in the decoder architecture and employs the
causal Wasserstein distance for training. We validate our method on synthetic
autoregressive models inspired by the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, demonstrating
superior performance in counterfactual probability estimation with L1 distances
as low as 0.03-0.10 compared to ground truth. The model enables financial
stress testing, scenario analysis, and enhanced backtesting by generating
plausible counterfactual market trajectories that respect underlying causal
mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04469v1,,False
Fitting Reinforcement Learning Model to Behavioral Data under Bandits,06/11/2025,"Hao Zhu, Jasper Hoffmann, Baohe Zhang, Joschka Boedecker","We consider the problem of fitting a reinforcement learning (RL) model to
some given behavioral data under a multi-armed bandit environment. These models
have received much attention in recent years for characterizing human and
animal decision making behavior. We provide a generic mathematical optimization
problem formulation for the fitting problem of a wide range of RL models that
appear frequently in scientific research applications, followed by a detailed
theoretical analysis of its convexity properties. Based on the theoretical
results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL
models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Our method is then
evaluated in several simulated bandit environments to compare with some
benchmark methods that appear in the literature. Numerical results indicate
that our method achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art, while
significantly reducing computation time. We also provide an open-source Python

ForecastGAN: A Decomposition-Based Adversarial Framework for Multi-Horizon Time Series Forecasting,06/11/2025,"Syeda Sitara Wishal Fatima, Afshin Rahimi","Time series forecasting is essential across domains from finance to supply
chain management. This paper introduces ForecastGAN, a novel decomposition
based adversarial framework addressing limitations in existing approaches for
multi-horizon predictions. Although transformer models excel in long-term
forecasting, they often underperform in short-term scenarios and typically
ignore categorical features. ForecastGAN operates through three integrated
modules: a Decomposition Module that extracts seasonality and trend components;
a Model Selection Module that identifies optimal neural network configurations
based on forecasting horizon; and an Adversarial Training Module that enhances
prediction robustness through Conditional Generative Adversarial Network
training. Unlike conventional approaches, ForecastGAN effectively integrates
both numerical and categorical features. We validate our framework on eleven
benchmark multivariate time series datasets that span various forecasting
horizons. The results show that ForecastGAN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art transformer models for short-term forecasting while remaining
competitive for long-term horizons. This research establishes a more
generalizable approach to time series forecasting that adapts to specific
contexts while maintaining strong performance across diverse data
characteristics without extensive hyperparameter tuning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04445v1,,False
Post-Training LLMs as Better Decision-Making Agents: A Regret-Minimization Approach,06/11/2025,"Chanwoo Park, Ziyang Chen, Asuman Ozdaglar, Kaiqing Zhang","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as ""agents"" for
decision-making (DM) in interactive and dynamic environments. Yet, since they
were not originally designed for DM, recent studies show that LLMs can struggle
even in basic online DM problems, failing to achieve low regret or an effective
exploration-exploitation tradeoff. To address this, we introduce Iterative
Regret-Minimization Fine-Tuning (Iterative RMFT), a post-training procedure
that repeatedly distills low-regret decision trajectories back into the base
model. At each iteration, the model rolls out multiple decision trajectories,
selects the k-lowest regret ones, and fine-tunes itself on them. Unlike prior
methods that (a) distill action sequences from known DM algorithms or (b) rely
on manually crafted chain-of-thought templates, our approach leverages the
regret metric to elicit the model's own DM ability and reasoning rationales.
This reliance on model-generated reasoning avoids rigid output engineering and
provides more flexible, natural-language training signals. Empirical results
show that Iterative RMFT improves LLMs' DM performance across diverse models -
from Transformers with numerical input/output, to open-weight LLMs, and
advanced closed-weight models like GPT-4o mini. Its flexibility in output and
reasoning formats enables generalization across tasks with varying horizons,
action spaces, reward processes, and natural-language contexts. Finally, we
provide theoretical insight showing that a single-layer Transformer under this
paradigm can act as a no-regret learner in a simplified setting. Overall,
Iterative RMFT offers a principled and general post-training framework for
enhancing LLMs' decision-making capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04393v1,,False
Causal Regime Detection in Energy Markets With Augmented Time Series Structural Causal Models,06/11/2025,Dennis Thumm,"Energy markets exhibit complex causal relationships between weather patterns,
generation technologies, and price formation, with regime changes occurring
continuously rather than at discrete break points. Current approaches model
electricity prices without explicit causal interpretation or counterfactual

multivariate temporal data with learned causal structure. Our approach models
energy systems through interpretable factors (weather, generation mix, demand
patterns), rich grid dynamics, and observable market variables. We integrate
neural causal discovery to learn time-varying causal graphs without requiring
ground truth DAGs. Applied to real-world electricity price data, ATSCM enables
novel counterfactual queries such as ""What would prices be under different

RxSafeBench: Identifying Medication Safety Issues of Large Language Models in Simulated Consultation,06/11/2025,"Jiahao Zhao, Luxin Xu, Minghuan Tan, Lichao Zhang, Ahmadreza Argha, Hamid Alinejad-Rokny, Min Yang","Numerous medical systems powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) have
achieved remarkable progress in diverse healthcare tasks. However, research on
their medication safety remains limited due to the lack of real world datasets,
constrained by privacy and accessibility issues. Moreover, evaluation of LLMs
in realistic clinical consultation settings, particularly regarding medication
safety, is still underexplored. To address these gaps, we propose a framework
that simulates and evaluates clinical consultations to systematically assess
the medication safety capabilities of LLMs. Within this framework, we generate
inquiry diagnosis dialogues with embedded medication risks and construct a
dedicated medication safety database, RxRisk DB, containing 6,725
contraindications, 28,781 drug interactions, and 14,906 indication-drug pairs.
A two-stage filtering strategy ensures clinical realism and professional
quality, resulting in the benchmark RxSafeBench with 2,443 high-quality
consultation scenarios. We evaluate leading open-source and proprietary LLMs
using structured multiple choice questions that test their ability to recommend
safe medications under simulated patient contexts. Results show that current
LLMs struggle to integrate contraindication and interaction knowledge,
especially when risks are implied rather than explicit. Our findings highlight
key challenges in ensuring medication safety in LLM-based systems and provide
insights into improving reliability through better prompting and task-specific
tuning. RxSafeBench offers the first comprehensive benchmark for evaluating
medication safety in LLMs, advancing safer and more trustworthy AI-driven
clinical decision support.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04328v1,,False
Proto-LeakNet: Towards Signal-Leak Aware Attribution in Synthetic Human Face Imagery,06/11/2025,"Claudio Giusti, Luca Guarnera, Sebastiano Battiato","The growing sophistication of synthetic image and deepfake generation models
has turned source attribution and authenticity verification into a critical
challenge for modern computer vision systems. Recent studies suggest that
diffusion pipelines unintentionally imprint persistent statistical traces,
known as signal leaks, within their outputs, particularly in latent
representations. Building on this observation, we propose Proto-LeakNet, a
signal-leak-aware and interpretable attribution framework that integrates
closed-set classification with a density-based open-set evaluation on the
learned embeddings, enabling analysis of unseen generators without retraining.
Operating in the latent domain of diffusion models, our method re-simulates
partial forward diffusion to expose residual generator-specific cues. A
temporal attention encoder aggregates multi-step latent features, while a
feature-weighted prototype head structures the embedding space and enables
transparent attribution. Trained solely on closed data and achieving a Macro
AUC of 98.13%, Proto-LeakNet learns a latent geometry that remains robust under
post-processing, surpassing state-of-the-art methods, and achieves strong
separability between known and unseen generators. These results demonstrate
that modeling signal-leak bias in latent space enables reliable and
interpretable AI-image and deepfake forensics. The code for the whole work will

Deep Learning Approach for Clinical Risk Identification Using Transformer Modeling of Heterogeneous EHR Data,06/11/2025,"Anzhuo Xie, Wei-Chen Chang","This study proposes a Transformer-based longitudinal modeling method to
address challenges in clinical risk classification with heterogeneous
Electronic Health Record (EHR) data, including irregular temporal patterns,
large modality differences, and complex semantic structures. The method takes
multi-source medical features as input and employs a feature embedding layer to
achieve a unified representation of structured and unstructured data. A
learnable temporal encoding mechanism is introduced to capture dynamic
evolution under uneven sampling intervals. The core model adopts a multi-head
self-attention structure to perform global dependency modeling on longitudinal
sequences, enabling the aggregation of long-term trends and short-term
fluctuations across different temporal scales. To enhance semantic
representation, a semantic-weighted pooling module is designed to assign
adaptive importance to key medical events, improving the discriminative ability
of risk-related features. Finally, a linear mapping layer generates
individual-level risk scores. Experimental results show that the proposed model
outperforms traditional machine learning and temporal deep learning models in

Learning to Land Anywhere: Transferable Generative Models for Aircraft Trajectories,06/11/2025,"Olav Finne Praesteng Larsen, Massimiliano Ruocco, Michail Spitieris, Abdulmajid Murad, Martina Ragosta","Access to trajectory data is a key requirement for developing and validating
Air Traffic Management (ATM) solutions, yet many secondary and regional
airports face severe data scarcity. This limits the applicability of machine
learning methods and the ability to perform large-scale simulations or
""what-if"" analyses. In this paper, we investigate whether generative models
trained on data-rich airports can be efficiently adapted to data-scarce
airports using transfer learning. We adapt state-of-the-art diffusion- and
flow-matching-based architectures to the aviation domain and evaluate their
transferability between Zurich (source) and Dublin (target) landing trajectory
datasets. Models are pretrained on Zurich and fine-tuned on Dublin with varying
amounts of local data, ranging from 0% to 100%. Results show that
diffusion-based models achieve competitive performance with as little as 5% of
the Dublin data and reach baseline-level performance around 20%, consistently
outperforming models trained from scratch across metrics and visual
inspections. Latent flow matching and latent diffusion models also benefit from
pretraining, though with more variable gains, while flow matching models show
weaker generalization. Despite challenges in capturing rare trajectory
patterns, these findings demonstrate the potential of transfer learning to
substantially reduce data requirements for trajectory generation in ATM,
enabling realistic synthetic data generation even in environments with limited

Testing the Testers: Human-Driven Quality Assessment of Voice AI Testing Platforms,06/11/2025,"Miguel E. Andres, Vadim Fedorov, Rida Sadek, Enric Spagnolo-Arrizabalaga, Nadescha Trudel","Voice AI agents are rapidly transitioning to production deployments, yet
systematic methods for ensuring testing reliability remain underdeveloped.
Organizations cannot objectively assess whether their testing approaches
(internal tools or external platforms) actually work, creating a critical
measurement gap as voice AI scales to billions of daily interactions.
  We present the first systematic framework for evaluating voice AI testing
quality through human-centered benchmarking. Our methodology addresses the
fundamental dual challenge of testing platforms: generating realistic test
conversations (simulation quality) and accurately evaluating agent responses
(evaluation quality). The framework combines established psychometric
techniques (pairwise comparisons yielding Elo ratings, bootstrap confidence

provide reproducible metrics applicable to any testing approach.
  To validate the framework and demonstrate its utility, we conducted
comprehensive empirical evaluation of three leading commercial platforms

significant performance differences with the proposed framework, with the
top-performing platform, Evalion, achieving 0.92 evaluation quality measured as
f1-score versus 0.73 for others, and 0.61 simulation quality using a league
based scoring system (including ties) vs 0.43 for other platforms.

A Characterization of List Language Identification in the Limit,06/11/2025,"Moses Charikar, Chirag Pabbaraju, Ambuj Tewari","We study the problem of language identification in the limit, where given a
sequence of examples from a target language, the goal of the learner is to
output a sequence of guesses for the target language such that all the guesses
beyond some finite time are correct. Classical results of Gold showed that
language identification in the limit is impossible for essentially any
interesting collection of languages. Later, Angluin gave a precise
characterization of language collections for which this task is possible.
Motivated by recent positive results for the related problem of language
generation, we revisit the classic language identification problem in the
setting where the learner is given the additional power of producing a list of
$k$ guesses at each time step. The goal is to ensure that beyond some finite
time, one of the guesses is correct at each time step.
  We give an exact characterization of collections of languages that can be
$k$-list identified in the limit, based on a recursive version of Angluin's
characterization (for language identification with a list of size $1$). This
further leads to a conceptually appealing characterization: A language
collection can be $k$-list identified in the limit if and only if the
collection can be decomposed into $k$ collections of languages, each of which
can be identified in the limit (with a list of size $1$). We also use our
characterization to establish rates for list identification in the statistical
setting where the input is drawn as an i.i.d. stream from a distribution
supported on some language in the collection. Our results show that if a
collection is $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then the collection can be
$k$-list identified at an exponential rate, and this is best possible. On the
other hand, if a collection is not $k$-list identifiable in the limit, then it
cannot be $k$-list identified at any rate that goes to zero.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.04103v1,,False
Memory- and Latency-Constrained Inference of Large Language Models via Adaptive Split Computing,06/11/2025,"Mingyu Sung, Vikas Palakonda, Suhwan Im, Sunghwan Moon, Il-Min Kim, Sangseok Yun, Jae-Mo Kang","Large language models (LLMs) have achieved near-human performance across
diverse reasoning tasks, yet their deployment on resource-constrained
Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices remains impractical due to massive parameter
footprints and memory-intensive autoregressive decoding. While split computing
offers a promising solution by partitioning model execution between edge
devices and cloud servers, existing approaches fail to address the unique
challenges of autoregressive inference, particularly the iterative token
generation process and expanding key-value (KV) cache requirements. This work
introduces the first autoregressive-aware split computing framework designed
explicitly for LLM deployment on edge devices. Our approach makes three key
contributions. First, we develop one-point split compression (OPSC), a
mixed-precision quantization scheme that prevents out-of-memory failures by
strategically partitioning models into front-end and back-end segments with
different precision levels. Second, we propose a two-stage intermediate
compression pipeline that combines threshold splitting (TS) and token-wise
adaptive bit quantization (TAB-Q) to preserve accuracy-critical activations
while dramatically reducing communication overhead. Third, we formulate a
unified optimization framework that jointly selects optimal split points,
quantization settings, and sequence lengths to satisfy strict memory and
latency constraints. Extensive evaluations across diverse LLMs and hardware
platforms demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art

inspiration from astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ signaling in the brain, where rapid,
context-sensitive adaptation enables robust information processing. Our
approach couples a multicellular astrocyte dynamics simulator with a deep
neural network (DNN). The simulator models astrocytic Ca$^{2+}$ dynamics
through three key mechanisms: IP$_3$-mediated Ca$^{2+}$ release, SERCA pump
uptake, and conductance-aware diffusion through gap junctions between cells.
Evaluation of our proposed network on CTU-13 (Neris) network traffic data
demonstrates the effectiveness of our biologically plausible approach. The
Ca$^{2+}$-gated model outperforms a matched baseline DNN, achieving up to
$\sim$98\% accuracy with reduced false positives and negatives across multiple
train/test splits. Importantly, this improved performance comes with negligible
runtime overhead once Ca$^{2+}$ trajectories are precomputed. While
demonstrated here for cybersecurity applications, this Ca$^{2+}$-modulated
learning framework offers a generic solution for streaming detection tasks that
require rapid, biologically grounded adaptation to evolving data patterns.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03993v1,,False
PETRA: Pretrained Evolutionary Transformer for SARS-CoV-2 Mutation Prediction,06/11/2025,Xu Zou,"Since its emergence, SARS-CoV-2 has demonstrated a rapid and unpredictable
evolutionary trajectory, characterized by the continual emergence of
immune-evasive variants. This poses persistent challenges to public health and
vaccine development.
  While large-scale generative pre-trained transformers (GPTs) have
revolutionized the modeling of sequential data, their direct applications to
noisy viral genomic sequences are limited. In this paper, we introduce
PETRA(Pretrained Evolutionary TRAnsformer), a novel transformer approach based
on evolutionary trajectories derived from phylogenetic trees rather than raw
RNA sequences. This method effectively mitigates sequencing noise and captures
the hierarchical structure of viral evolution.
  With a weighted training framework to address substantial geographical and
temporal imbalances in global sequence data, PETRA excels in predicting future
SARS-CoV-2 mutations, achieving a weighted recall@1 of 9.45% for nucleotide
mutations and 17.10\% for spike amino-acid mutations, compared to 0.49% and
6.64% respectively for the best baseline. PETRA also demonstrates its ability
to aid in the real-time mutation prediction of major clades like 24F(XEC) and
25A(LP.8.1). The code is open sourced on https://github.com/xz-keg/PETra",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03976v1,,False
PEFA-AI: Advancing Open-source LLMs for RTL generation using Progressive Error Feedback Agentic-AI,06/11/2025,"Athma Narayanan, Mahesh Subedar, Omesh Tickoo","We present an agentic flow consisting of multiple agents that combine
specialized LLMs and hardware simulation tools to collaboratively complete the
complex task of Register Transfer Level (RTL) generation without human
intervention. A key feature of the proposed flow is the progressive error
feedback system of agents (PEFA), a self-correcting mechanism that leverages
iterative error feedback to progressively increase the complexity of the
approach. The generated RTL includes checks for compilation, functional
correctness, and synthesizable constructs. To validate this adaptive approach
to code generation, benchmarking is performed using two opensource natural
language-to-RTL datasets. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach
implemented on an open source agentic framework, using both open- and
closed-source LLMs, effectively bridging the performance gap between them.
Compared to previously published methods, our approach sets a new benchmark,
providing state-of-the-art pass rates while being efficient in token counts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03934v1,,False
On Predicting Sociodemographics from Mobility Signals,06/11/2025,"Ekin Uğurel, Cynthia Chen, Brian H. Y. Lee, Filipe Rodrigues","Inferring sociodemographic attributes from mobility data could help
transportation planners better leverage passively collected datasets, but this
task remains difficult due to weak and inconsistent relationships between
mobility patterns and sociodemographic traits, as well as limited
generalization across contexts. We address these challenges from three angles.
First, to improve predictive accuracy while retaining interpretability, we
introduce a behaviorally grounded set of higher-order mobility descriptors
based on directed mobility graphs. These features capture structured patterns
in trip sequences, travel modes, and social co-travel, and significantly
improve prediction of age, gender, income, and household structure over
baselines features. Second, we introduce metrics and visual diagnostic tools
that encourage evenness between model confidence and accuracy, enabling
planners to quantify uncertainty. Third, to improve generalization and sample
efficiency, we develop a multitask learning framework that jointly predicts
multiple sociodemographic attributes from a shared representation. This
approach outperforms single-task models, particularly when training data are
limited or when applying models across different time periods (i.e., when the
test set distribution differs from the training set).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.03924v1,,False
