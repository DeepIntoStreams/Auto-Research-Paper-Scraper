Adaptive Estimation and Learning under Temporal Distribution Shift,21/05/2025,"Dheeraj Baby, Yifei Tang, Hieu Duy Nguyen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Rohit Pyati","In this paper, we study the problem of estimation and learning under temporal
distribution shift. Consider an observation sequence of length $n$, which is a
noisy realization of a time-varying groundtruth sequence. Our focus is to
develop methods to estimate the groundtruth at the final time-step while
providing sharp point-wise estimation error rates. We show that, without prior
knowledge on the level of temporal shift, a wavelet soft-thresholding estimator
provides an optimal estimation error bound for the groundtruth. Our proposed
estimation method generalizes existing researches Mazzetto and Upfal (2023) by
establishing a connection between the sequence's non-stationarity level and the
sparsity in the wavelet-transformed domain. Our theoretical findings are
validated by numerical experiments. Additionally, we applied the estimator to
derive sparsity-aware excess risk bounds for binary classification under
distribution shift and to develop computationally efficient training
objectives. As a final contribution, we draw parallels between our results and
the classical signal processing problem of total-variation denoising (Mammen
and van de Geer,1997; Tibshirani, 2014), uncovering novel optimal algorithms
for such task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15803v1,,False
"A Deep Learning Framework for Two-Dimensional, Multi-Frequency Propagation Factor Estimation",21/05/2025,"Sarah E. Wessinger, Leslie N. Smith, Jacob Gull, Jonathan Gehman, Zachary Beever, Andrew J. Kammerer","Accurately estimating the refractive environment over multiple frequencies
within the marine atmospheric boundary layer is crucial for the effective
deployment of radar technologies. Traditional parabolic equation simulations,
while effective, can be computationally expensive and time-intensive, limiting
their practical application. This communication explores a novel approach using
deep neural networks to estimate the pattern propagation factor, a critical
parameter for characterizing environmental impacts on signal propagation.
Image-to-image translation generators designed to ingest modified refractivity
data and generate predictions of pattern propagation factors over the same
domain were developed. Findings demonstrate that deep neural networks can be
trained to analyze multiple frequencies and reasonably predict the pattern
propagation factor, offering an alternative to traditional methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15802v1,,False
HAMF: A Hybrid Attention-Mamba Framework for Joint Scene Context Understanding and Future Motion Representation Learning,21/05/2025,"Xiaodong Mei, Sheng Wang, Jie Cheng, Yingbing Chen, Dan Xu","Motion forecasting represents a critical challenge in autonomous driving
systems, requiring accurate prediction of surrounding agents' future
trajectories. While existing approaches predict future motion states with the
extracted scene context feature from historical agent trajectories and road
layouts, they suffer from the information degradation during the scene feature
encoding. To address the limitation, we propose HAMF, a novel motion
forecasting framework that learns future motion representations with the scene
context encoding jointly, to coherently combine the scene understanding and
future motion state prediction. We first embed the observed agent states and
map information into 1D token sequences, together with the target multi-modal
future motion features as a set of learnable tokens. Then we design a unified
Attention-based encoder, which synergistically combines self-attention and
cross-attention mechanisms to model the scene context information and aggregate
future motion features jointly. Complementing the encoder, we implement the
Mamba module in the decoding stage to further preserve the consistency and
correlations among the learned future motion representations, to generate the
accurate and diverse final trajectories. Extensive experiments on Argoverse 2
benchmark demonstrate that our hybrid Attention-Mamba model achieves
state-of-the-art motion forecasting performance with the simple and lightweight
architecture.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15703v1,,False

Alignment ($\textbf{FLARE}$), a novel framework that integrates predictive
latent world modeling into robot policy learning. By aligning features from a
diffusion transformer with latent embeddings of future observations,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ enables a diffusion transformer policy to anticipate latent
representations of future observations, allowing it to reason about long-term
consequences while generating actions. Remarkably lightweight, $\textbf{FLARE}$
requires only minimal architectural modifications -- adding a few tokens to
standard vision-language-action (VLA) models -- yet delivers substantial
performance gains. Across two challenging multitask simulation imitation
learning benchmarks spanning single-arm and humanoid tabletop manipulation,
$\textbf{FLARE}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming prior
policy learning baselines by up to 26%. Moreover, $\textbf{FLARE}$ unlocks the
ability to co-train with human egocentric video demonstrations without action

Impact of Data Sparsity on Machine Learning for Fault Detection in Power System Protection,21/05/2025,"Julian Oelhaf, Georg Kordowich, Changhun Kim, Paula Andrea Perez-Toro, Andreas Maier, Johann Jager, Siming Bayer","Germany's transition to a renewable energy-based power system is reshaping
grid operations, requiring advanced monitoring and control to manage
decentralized generation. Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool
for power system protection, particularly for fault detection (FD) and fault
line identification (FLI) in transmission grids. However, ML model reliability
depends on data quality and availability. Data sparsity resulting from sensor
failures, communication disruptions, or reduced sampling rates poses a
challenge to ML-based FD and FLI. Yet, its impact has not been systematically
validated prior to this work. In response, we propose a framework to assess the
impact of data sparsity on ML-based FD and FLI performance. We simulate
realistic data sparsity scenarios, evaluate their impact, derive quantitative
insights, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this evaluation strategy by
applying it to an existing ML-based framework. Results show the ML model
remains robust for FD, maintaining an F1-score of 0.999 $\pm$ 0.000 even after
a 50x data reduction. In contrast, FLI is more sensitive, with performance
decreasing by 55.61% for missing voltage measurements and 9.73% due to
communication failures at critical network points. These findings offer
actionable insights for optimizing ML models for real-world grid protection.
This enables more efficient FD and supports targeted improvements in FLI.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15560v1,,False
Robo-DM: Data Management For Large Robot Datasets,21/05/2025,"Kaiyuan Chen, Letian Fu, David Huang, Yanxiang Zhang, Lawrence Yunliang Chen, Huang Huang, Kush Hari, Ashwin Balakrishna, Ted Xiao, Pannag R Sanketi, John Kubiatowicz, Ken Goldberg","Recent results suggest that very large datasets of teleoperated robot
demonstrations can be used to train transformer-based models that have the
potential to generalize to new scenes, robots, and tasks. However, curating,
distributing, and loading large datasets of robot trajectories, which typically
consist of video, textual, and numerical modalities - including streams from
multiple cameras - remains challenging. We propose Robo-DM, an efficient
open-source cloud-based data management toolkit for collecting, sharing, and
learning with robot data. With Robo-DM, robot datasets are stored in a
self-contained format with Extensible Binary Meta Language (EBML). Robo-DM can
significantly reduce the size of robot trajectory data, transfer costs, and
data load time during training. Compared to the RLDS format used in OXE
datasets, Robo-DM's compression saves space by up to 70x (lossy) and 3.5x
(lossless). Robo-DM also accelerates data retrieval by load-balancing video
decoding with memory-mapped decoding caches. Compared to LeRobot, a framework
that also uses lossy video compression, Robo-DM is up to 50x faster when
decoding sequentially. We physically evaluate a model trained by Robo-DM with
lossy compression, a pick-and-place task, and In-Context Robot Transformer.
Robo-DM uses 75x compression of the original dataset and does not suffer
reduction in downstream task accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15558v1,,False
Evaluate Bias without Manual Test Sets: A Concept Representation Perspective for LLMs,21/05/2025,"Lang Gao, Kaiyang Wan, Wei Liu, Chenxi Wang, Zirui Song, Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Veselin Stoyanov, Xiuying Chen","Bias in Large Language Models (LLMs) significantly undermines their
reliability and fairness. We focus on a common form of bias: when two reference
concepts in the model's concept space, such as sentiment polarities (e.g.,
""positive"" and ""negative""), are asymmetrically correlated with a third, target
concept, such as a reviewing aspect, the model exhibits unintended bias. For
instance, the understanding of ""food"" should not skew toward any particular
sentiment. Existing bias evaluation methods assess behavioral differences of
LLMs by constructing labeled data for different social groups and measuring
model responses across them, a process that requires substantial human effort
and captures only a limited set of social concepts. To overcome these
limitations, we propose BiasLens, a test-set-free bias analysis framework based
on the structure of the model's vector space. BiasLens combines Concept
Activation Vectors (CAVs) with Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to extract
interpretable concept representations, and quantifies bias by measuring the
variation in representational similarity between the target concept and each of
the reference concepts. Even without labeled data, BiasLens shows strong
agreement with traditional bias evaluation metrics (Spearman correlation r >
0.85). Moreover, BiasLens reveals forms of bias that are difficult to detect
using existing methods. For example, in simulated clinical scenarios, a
patient's insurance status can cause the LLM to produce biased diagnostic
assessments. Overall, BiasLens offers a scalable, interpretable, and efficient
paradigm for bias discovery, paving the way for improving fairness and
transparency in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15524v1,,False
Robo2VLM: Visual Question Answering from Large-Scale In-the-Wild Robot Manipulation Datasets,21/05/2025,"Kaiyuan Chen, Shuangyu Xie, Zehan Ma, Ken Goldberg","Vision-Language Models (VLMs) acquire real-world knowledge and general
reasoning ability through Internet-scale image-text corpora. They can augment
robotic systems with scene understanding and task planning, and assist
visuomotor policies that are trained on robot trajectory data. We explore the
reverse paradigm - using rich, real, multi-modal robot trajectory data to
enhance and evaluate VLMs. In this paper, we present Robo2VLM, a Visual
Question Answering (VQA) dataset generation framework for VLMs. Given a human
tele-operated robot trajectory, Robo2VLM derives ground-truth from non-visual
and non-descriptive sensory modalities, such as end-effector pose, gripper
aperture, and force sensing. Based on these modalities, it segments the robot
trajectory into a sequence of manipulation phases. At each phase, Robo2VLM uses
scene and interaction understanding to identify 3D properties of the robot,
task goal, and the target object. The properties are used to generate
representative VQA queries - images with textural multiple-choice questions -
based on spatial, goal-conditioned, and interaction reasoning question
templates. We curate Robo2VLM-1, a large-scale in-the-wild dataset with 684,710
questions covering 463 distinct scenes and 3,396 robotic manipulation tasks
from 176k real robot trajectories. Results suggest that Robo2VLM-1 can
benchmark and improve VLM capabilities in spatial and interaction reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15517v1,,False
Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures for Compositional Embeddings in Machine Learning,21/05/2025,Mahesh Godavarti,"We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional
embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core
contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing
theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange
law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine
learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition
operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each
axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific
operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that
enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first
approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical
sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and
transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For
example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the
familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the
SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support
recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several
potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured
positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and
symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future
deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of
our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is
theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to
future work, which we plan to undertake.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15507v1,,False
Coloring Between the Lines: Personalization in the Null Space of Planning Constraints,21/05/2025,"Tom Silver, Rajat Kumar Jenamani, Ziang Liu, Ben Dodson, Tapomayukh Bhattacharjee","Generalist robots must personalize in-the-wild to meet the diverse needs and
preferences of long-term users. How can we enable flexible personalization
without sacrificing safety or competency? This paper proposes Coloring Between
the Lines (CBTL), a method for personalization that exploits the null space of
constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) used in robot planning. CBTL begins
with a CSP generator that ensures safe and competent behavior, then
incrementally personalizes behavior by learning parameterized constraints from
online interaction. By quantifying uncertainty and leveraging the
compositionality of planning constraints, CBTL achieves sample-efficient
adaptation without environment resets. We evaluate CBTL in (1) three diverse
simulation environments; (2) a web-based user study; and (3) a real-robot
assisted feeding system, finding that CBTL consistently achieves more effective
personalization with fewer interactions than baselines. Our results demonstrate
that CBTL provides a unified and practical approach for continual, flexible,
active, and safe robot personalization. Website:

Protoknowledge Shapes Behaviour of LLMs in Downstream Tasks: Memorization and Generalization with Knowledge Graphs,21/05/2025,"Federico Ranaldi, Andrea Zugarini, Leonardo Ranaldi, Fabio Massimo Zanzotto","We introduce the concept of protoknowledge to formalize and measure how
sequences of tokens encoding Knowledge Graphs are internalized during
pretraining and utilized at inference time by Large Language Models (LLMs).
Indeed, LLMs have demonstrated the ability to memorize vast amounts of token
sequences during pretraining, and a central open question is how they leverage
this memorization as reusable knowledge through generalization. We then
categorize protoknowledge into lexical, hierarchical, and topological forms,
varying on the type of knowledge that needs to be activated. We measure
protoknowledge through Knowledge Activation Tasks (KATs), analyzing its general
properties such as semantic bias. We then investigate the impact of
protoknowledge on Text-to-SPARQL performance by varying prompting strategies
depending on input conditions. To this end, we adopt a novel analysis framework
that assesses whether model predictions align with the successful activation of
the relevant protoknowledge for each query. This methodology provides a
practical tool to explore Semantic-Level Data Contamination and serves as an
effective strategy for Closed-Pretraining models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15501v1,,False
Audio Jailbreak: An Open Comprehensive Benchmark for Jailbreaking Large Audio-Language Models,21/05/2025,"Zirui Song, Qian Jiang, Mingxuan Cui, Mingzhe Li, Lang Gao, Zeyu Zhang, Zixiang Xu, Yanbo Wang, Chenxi Wang, Guangxian Ouyang, Zhenhao Chen, Xiuying Chen","The rise of Large Audio Language Models (LAMs) brings both potential and
risks, as their audio outputs may contain harmful or unethical content.
However, current research lacks a systematic, quantitative evaluation of LAM
safety especially against jailbreak attacks, which are challenging due to the
temporal and semantic nature of speech. To bridge this gap, we introduce
AJailBench, the first benchmark specifically designed to evaluate jailbreak
vulnerabilities in LAMs. We begin by constructing AJailBench-Base, a dataset of
1,495 adversarial audio prompts spanning 10 policy-violating categories,
converted from textual jailbreak attacks using realistic text to speech
synthesis. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art LAMs and
reveal that none exhibit consistent robustness across attacks. To further
strengthen jailbreak testing and simulate more realistic attack conditions, we
propose a method to generate dynamic adversarial variants. Our Audio
Perturbation Toolkit (APT) applies targeted distortions across time, frequency,
and amplitude domains. To preserve the original jailbreak intent, we enforce a
semantic consistency constraint and employ Bayesian optimization to efficiently
search for perturbations that are both subtle and highly effective. This
results in AJailBench-APT, an extended dataset of optimized adversarial audio
samples. Our findings demonstrate that even small, semantically preserved
perturbations can significantly reduce the safety performance of leading LAMs,
underscoring the need for more robust and semantically aware defense
mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.15406v1,,False
Accelerating Autoregressive Speech Synthesis Inference With Speech Speculative Decoding,21/05/2025,"Zijian Lin, Yang Zhang, Yougen Yuan, Yuming Yan, Jinjiang Liu, Zhiyong Wu, Pengfei Hu, Qun Yu","Modern autoregressive speech synthesis models leveraging language models have
demonstrated remarkable performance. However, the sequential nature of next
token prediction in these models leads to significant latency, hindering their
deployment in scenarios where inference speed is critical. In this work, we
propose Speech Speculative Decoding (SSD), a novel framework for autoregressive
speech synthesis acceleration. Specifically, our method employs a lightweight
draft model to generate candidate token sequences, which are subsequently
verified in parallel by the target model using the proposed SSD framework.
Experimental results demonstrate that SSD achieves a significant speedup of
1.4x compared with conventional autoregressive decoding, while maintaining high
fidelity and naturalness. Subjective evaluations further validate the
effectiveness of SSD in preserving the perceptual quality of the target model

Loss-Guided Auxiliary Agents for Overcoming Mode Collapse in GFlowNets,21/05/2025,"Idriss Malek, Abhijit Sharma, Salem Lahlou","Although Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) are designed to capture
multiple modes of a reward function, they often suffer from mode collapse in
practice, getting trapped in early discovered modes and requiring prolonged
training to find diverse solutions. Existing exploration techniques may rely on
heuristic novelty signals. We propose Loss-Guided GFlowNets (LGGFN), a novel
approach where an auxiliary GFlowNet's exploration is directly driven by the
main GFlowNet's training loss. By prioritizing trajectories where the main
model exhibits high loss, LGGFN focuses sampling on poorly understood regions
of the state space. This targeted exploration significantly accelerates the
discovery of diverse, high-reward samples. Empirically, across various
benchmarks including grid environments, structured sequence generation, and
Bayesian structure learning, LGGFN consistently enhances exploration efficiency

SAMA-UNet: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation with Self-Adaptive Mamba-Like Attention and Causal-Resonance Learning,21/05/2025,"Saqib Qamar, Mohd Fazil, Parvez Ahmad, Ghulam Muhammad","Medical image segmentation plays an important role in various clinical
applications, but existing models often struggle with the computational
inefficiencies and challenges posed by complex medical data. State Space
Sequence Models (SSMs) have demonstrated promise in modeling long-range
dependencies with linear computational complexity, yet their application in
medical image segmentation remains hindered by incompatibilities with image
tokens and autoregressive assumptions. Moreover, it is difficult to achieve a
balance in capturing both local fine-grained information and global semantic
dependencies. To address these challenges, we introduce SAMA-UNet, a novel
architecture for medical image segmentation. A key innovation is the
Self-Adaptive Mamba-like Aggregated Attention (SAMA) block, which integrates
contextual self-attention with dynamic weight modulation to prioritise the most
relevant features based on local and global contexts. This approach reduces
computational complexity and improves the representation of complex image
features across multiple scales. We also suggest the Causal-Resonance
Multi-Scale Module (CR-MSM), which enhances the flow of information between the
encoder and decoder by using causal resonance learning. This mechanism allows
the model to automatically adjust feature resolution and causal dependencies
across scales, leading to better semantic alignment between the low-level and
high-level features in U-shaped architectures. Experiments on MRI, CT, and
endoscopy images show that SAMA-UNet performs better in segmentation accuracy
than current methods using CNN, Transformer, and Mamba. The implementation is

to their high dimensionality, non-stationarity, and persistent volatility.
Despite advances in large language models and multi-agent systems, current
quantitative research pipelines suffer from limited automation, weak
interpretability, and fragmented coordination across key components such as
factor mining and model innovation. In this paper, we propose R&D-Agent for
Quantitative Finance, in short RD-Agent(Q), the first data-centric multi-agent
framework designed to automate the full-stack research and development of
quantitative strategies via coordinated factor-model co-optimization.
RD-Agent(Q) decomposes the quant process into two iterative stages: a Research
stage that dynamically sets goal-aligned prompts, formulates hypotheses based
on domain priors, and maps them to concrete tasks, and a Development stage that
employs a code-generation agent, Co-STEER, to implement task-specific code,
which is then executed in real-market backtests. The two stages are connected
through a feedback stage that thoroughly evaluates experimental outcomes and
informs subsequent iterations, with a multi-armed bandit scheduler for adaptive

Time Tracker: Mixture-of-Experts-Enhanced Foundation Time Series Forecasting Model with Decoupled Training Pipelines,21/05/2025,"Xiaohou Shi, Ke Li, Aobo Liang, Yan Sun","In the past few years, time series foundation models have achieved superior
predicting accuracy. However, real-world time series often exhibit significant
diversity in their temporal patterns across different time spans and domains,
making it challenging for a single model architecture to fit all complex

complex correlations between each other. Recent mainstream works have focused
on modeling times series in a channel-independent manner in both pretraining

Steering Generative Models with Experimental Data for Protein Fitness Optimization,21/05/2025,"Jason Yang, Wenda Chu, Daniel Khalil, Raul Astudillo, Bruce J. Wittmann, Frances H. Arnold, Yisong Yue","Protein fitness optimization involves finding a protein sequence that

Robust Multi-Modal Forecasting: Integrating Static and Dynamic Features,21/05/2025,Jeremy Qin,"Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in various applications,

extend this framework by incorporating exogenous time series features alongside
static features in a structured manner, while maintaining cohesive
interpretation. Our approach leverages the insights of trajectory comprehension
to introduce an encoding mechanism for exogenous time series, where they are

the restricted spectral gap, the applicability of our results is extended to
broader settings such as when the usual spectral gap is difficult to bound or
becomes degenerate. We demonstrate the application of our theoretical results
by analyzing simulated tempering combined with random walk Metropolis--Hastings
