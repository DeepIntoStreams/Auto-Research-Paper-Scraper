SOAP-RL: Sequential Option Advantage Propagation for Reinforcement Learning in POMDP Environments,26/07/2024,"Shu Ishida, João F. Henriques","This work compares ways of extending Reinforcement Learning algorithms to
Partially Observed Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) with options. One view of
options is as temporally extended action, which can be realized as a memory
that allows the agent to retain historical information beyond the policy's
context window. While option assignment could be handled using heuristics and
hand-crafted objectives, learning temporally consistent options and associated
sub-policies without explicit supervision is a challenge. Two algorithms, PPOEM
and SOAP, are proposed and studied in depth to address this problem. PPOEM
applies the forward-backward algorithm (for Hidden Markov Models) to optimize
the expected returns for an option-augmented policy. However, this learning
approach is unstable during on-policy rollouts. It is also unsuited for
learning causal policies without the knowledge of future trajectories, since
option assignments are optimized for offline sequences where the entire episode
is available. As an alternative approach, SOAP evaluates the policy gradient
for an optimal option assignment. It extends the concept of the generalized
advantage estimation (GAE) to propagate option advantages through time, which
is an analytical equivalent to performing temporal back-propagation of option
policy gradients. This option policy is only conditional on the history of the
agent, not future actions. Evaluated against competing baselines, SOAP
exhibited the most robust performance, correctly discovering options for POMDP
corridor environments, as well as on standard benchmarks including Atari and
MuJoCo, outperforming PPOEM, as well as LSTM and Option-Critic baselines. The
open-sourced code is available at https://github.com/shuishida/SoapRL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18913v1,,False
"Lessons from Learning to Spin ""Pens""",26/07/2024,"Jun Wang, Ying Yuan, Haichuan Che, Haozhi Qi, Yi Ma, Jitendra Malik, Xiaolong Wang","In-hand manipulation of pen-like objects is an important skill in our daily
lives, as many tools such as hammers and screwdrivers are similarly shaped.
However, current learning-based methods struggle with this task due to a lack
of high-quality demonstrations and the significant gap between simulation and
the real world. In this work, we push the boundaries of learning-based in-hand
manipulation systems by demonstrating the capability to spin pen-like objects.
We first use reinforcement learning to train an oracle policy with privileged
information and generate a high-fidelity trajectory dataset in simulation. This
serves two purposes: 1) pre-training a sensorimotor policy in simulation; 2)
conducting open-loop trajectory replay in the real world. We then fine-tune the
sensorimotor policy using these real-world trajectories to adapt it to the real
world dynamics. With less than 50 trajectories, our policy learns to rotate
more than ten pen-like objects with different physical properties for multiple
revolutions. We present a comprehensive analysis of our design choices and
share the lessons learned during development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18902v1,,False
AppWorld: A Controllable World of Apps and People for Benchmarking Interactive Coding Agents,26/07/2024,"Harsh Trivedi, Tushar Khot, Mareike Hartmann, Ruskin Manku, Vinty Dong, Edward Li, Shashank Gupta, Ashish Sabharwal, Niranjan Balasubramanian","Autonomous agents that address day-to-day digital tasks (e.g., ordering
groceries for a household), must not only operate multiple apps (e.g., notes,
messaging, shopping app) via APIs, but also generate rich code with complex
control flow in an iterative manner based on their interaction with the
environment. However, existing benchmarks for tool use are inadequate, as they
only cover tasks that require a simple sequence of API calls.
  To remedy this gap, we built $\textbf{AppWorld Engine}$, a high-quality
execution environment (60K lines of code) of 9 day-to-day apps operable via 457
APIs and populated with realistic digital activities simulating the lives of
~100 fictitious users. We then created $\textbf{AppWorld Benchmark}$ (40K lines
of code), a suite of 750 natural, diverse, and challenging autonomous agent
tasks requiring rich and interactive code generation. It supports robust
programmatic evaluation with state-based unit tests, allowing for different
ways of completing a task while also checking for unexpected changes, i.e.,
collateral damage. The state-of-the-art LLM, GPT-4o, solves only ~49% of our
'normal' tasks and ~30% of 'challenge' tasks, while other models solve at least
16% fewer. This highlights the benchmark's difficulty and AppWorld's potential
to push the frontiers of interactive coding agents. The project website is
available at https://appworld.dev/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18901v1,,False
Learning production functions for supply chains with graph neural networks,26/07/2024,"Serina Chang, Zhiyin Lin, Benjamin Yan, Swapnil Bembde, Qi Xiu, Chi Heem Wong, Yu Qin, Frank Kloster, Alex Luo, Raj Palleti, Jure Leskovec","The global economy relies on the flow of goods over supply chain networks,
with nodes as firms and edges as transactions between firms. While we may
observe these external transactions, they are governed by unseen production
functions, which determine how firms internally transform the input products
they receive into output products that they sell. In this setting, it can be
extremely valuable to infer these production functions, to better understand
and improve supply chains, and to forecast future transactions more accurately.
However, existing graph neural networks (GNNs) cannot capture these hidden
relationships between nodes' inputs and outputs. Here, we introduce a new class
of models for this setting, by combining temporal GNNs with a novel inventory
module, which learns production functions via attention weights and a special
loss function. We evaluate our models extensively on real supply chains data,
along with data generated from our new open-source simulator, SupplySim. Our
models successfully infer production functions, with a 6-50% improvement over
baselines, and forecast future transactions on real and synthetic data,
outperforming baselines by 11-62%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18772v1,,False
Cluster-norm for Unsupervised Probing of Knowledge,26/07/2024,"Walter Laurito, Sharan Maiya, Grégoire Dhimoïla, Owen, Yeung, Kaarel Hänni","The deployment of language models brings challenges in generating reliable
information, especially when these models are fine-tuned using human
preferences. To extract encoded knowledge without (potentially) biased human
labels, unsupervised probing techniques like Contrast-Consistent Search (CCS)
have been developed (Burns et al., 2022). However, salient but unrelated
features in a given dataset can mislead these probes (Farquhar et al., 2023).
Addressing this, we propose a cluster normalization method to minimize the
impact of such features by clustering and normalizing activations of contrast
pairs before applying unsupervised probing techniques. While this approach does
not address the issue of differentiating between knowledge in general and
simulated knowledge - a major issue in the literature of latent knowledge
elicitation (Christiano et al., 2021) - it significantly improves the ability
of unsupervised probes to identify the intended knowledge amidst distractions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18712v1,,False
Contrastive Learning of Asset Embeddings from Financial Time Series,26/07/2024,"Rian Dolphin, Barry Smyth, Ruihai Dong","Representation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for extracting
valuable latent features from complex, high-dimensional data. In financial
domains, learning informative representations for assets can be used for tasks
like sector classification, and risk management. However, the complex and
stochastic nature of financial markets poses unique challenges. We propose a
novel contrastive learning framework to generate asset embeddings from
financial time series data. Our approach leverages the similarity of asset
returns over many subwindows to generate informative positive and negative
samples, using a statistical sampling strategy based on hypothesis testing to
address the noisy nature of financial data. We explore various contrastive loss
functions that capture the relationships between assets in different ways to
learn a discriminative representation space. Experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of the learned asset embeddings on benchmark
industry classification and portfolio optimization tasks. In each case our
novel approaches significantly outperform existing baselines highlighting the
potential for contrastive learning to capture meaningful and actionable
relationships in financial data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18645v1,,False
Constructing Enhanced Mutual Information for Online Class-Incremental Learning,26/07/2024,"Huan Zhang, Fan Lyu, Shenghua Fan, Yujin Zheng, Dingwen Wang","Online Class-Incremental continual Learning (OCIL) addresses the challenge of
continuously learning from a single-channel data stream, adapting to new tasks
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, Mutual Information
(MI)-based methods have shown promising performance in OCIL. However, existing
MI-based methods treat various knowledge components in isolation, ignoring the
knowledge confusion across tasks. This narrow focus on simple MI knowledge
alignment may lead to old tasks being easily forgotten with the introduction of
new tasks, risking the loss of common parts between past and present
knowledge.To address this, we analyze the MI relationships from the
perspectives of diversity, representativeness, and separability, and propose an
Enhanced Mutual Information (EMI) method based on knwoledge decoupling. EMI
consists of Diversity Mutual Information (DMI), Representativeness Mutual
Information (RMI) and Separability Mutual Information (SMI). DMI diversifies
intra-class sample features by considering the similarity relationships among
inter-class sample features to enable the network to learn more general
knowledge. RMI summarizes representative features for each category and aligns
sample features with these representative features, making the intra-class
sample distribution more compact. SMI establishes MI relationships for
inter-class representative features, enhancing the stability of representative
features while increasing the distinction between inter-class representative
features, thus creating clear boundaries between class. Extensive experimental
results on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance
of EMI over state-of-the-art baseline methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18526v1,,False
A Reliable Common-Sense Reasoning Socialbot Built Using LLMs and Goal-Directed ASP,26/07/2024,"Yankai Zeng, Abhiramon Rajashekharan, Kinjal Basu, Huaduo Wang, Joaquín Arias, Gopal Gupta","The development of large language models (LLMs), such as GPT, has enabled the
construction of several socialbots, like ChatGPT, that are receiving a lot of
attention for their ability to simulate a human conversation. However, the
conversation is not guided by a goal and is hard to control. In addition,
because LLMs rely more on pattern recognition than deductive reasoning, they
can give confusing answers and have difficulty integrating multiple topics into
a cohesive response. These limitations often lead the LLM to deviate from the
main topic to keep the conversation interesting. We propose AutoCompanion, a
socialbot that uses an LLM model to translate natural language into predicates
(and vice versa) and employs commonsense reasoning based on Answer Set
Programming (ASP) to hold a social conversation with a human. In particular, we
rely on s(CASP), a goal-directed implementation of ASP as the backend. This
paper presents the framework design and how an LLM is used to parse user
messages and generate a response from the s(CASP) engine output. To validate
our proposal, we describe (real) conversations in which the chatbot's goal is
to keep the user entertained by talking about movies and books, and s(CASP)
ensures (i) correctness of answers, (ii) coherence (and precision) during the
conversation, which it dynamically regulates to achieve its specific purpose,
and (iii) no deviation from the main topic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18498v1,,False
