MechaFormer: Sequence Learning for Kinematic Mechanism Design Automation,12/08/2025,"Diana Bolanos, Mohammadmehdi Ataei, Pradeep Kumar Jayaraman","Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09005v1,,False
Retrospective Sparse Attention for Efficient Long-Context Generation,12/08/2025,"Seonghwan Choi, Beomseok Kang, Dongwon Jo, Jae-Joon Kim","Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in long-context tasks
such as reasoning, code generation, and multi-turn dialogue. However, inference
over extended contexts is bottlenecked by the Key-Value (KV) cache, whose
memory footprint grows linearly with sequence length and dominates latency at
each decoding step. While recent KV cache compression methods identify and load
important tokens, they focus predominantly on input contexts and fail to
address the cumulative attention errors that arise during long decoding. In
this paper, we introduce RetroAttention, a novel KV cache update technique that
retrospectively revises past attention outputs using newly arrived KV entries
from subsequent decoding steps. By maintaining a lightweight output cache,
RetroAttention enables past queries to efficiently access more relevant
context, while incurring minimal latency overhead. This breaks the
fixed-attention-output paradigm and allows continual correction of prior
approximations. Extensive experiments on long-generation benchmarks show that
RetroAttention consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) KV compression
methods, increasing effective KV exposure by up to 1.6$\times$ and accuracy by
up to 21.9\%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09001v1,,False
Automatic and standardized surgical reporting for central nervous system tumors,12/08/2025,"David Bouget, Mathilde Gajda Faanes, Asgeir Store Jakola, Frederik Barkhof, Hilko Ardon, Lorenzo Bello, Mitchel S. Berger, Shawn L. Hervey-Jumper, Julia Furtner, Albert J. S. Idema, Barbara Kiesel, Georg Widhalm, Rishi Nandoe Tewarie, Emmanuel Mandonnet, Pierre A. Robe, Michiel Wagemakers, Timothy R. Smith, Philip C. De Witt Hamer, Ole solheim, Ingerid Reinertsen","Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08916v1,,False
Geometry-Aware Global Feature Aggregation for Real-Time Indirect Illumination,12/08/2025,"Meng Gai, Guoping Wang, Sheng Li","Real-time rendering with global illumination is crucial to afford the user
realistic experience in virtual environments. We present a learning-based
estimator to predict diffuse indirect illumination in screen space, which then
is combined with direct illumination to synthesize globally-illuminated high
dynamic range (HDR) results. Our approach tackles the challenges of capturing
long-range/long-distance indirect illumination when employing neural networks
and is generalized to handle complex lighting and scenarios.
  From the neural network thinking of the solver to the rendering equation, we
present a novel network architecture to predict indirect illumination. Our
network is equipped with a modified attention mechanism that aggregates global
information guided by spacial geometry features, as well as a monochromatic
design that encodes each color channel individually.
  We conducted extensive evaluations, and the experimental results demonstrate
our superiority over previous learning-based techniques. Our approach excels at
handling complex lighting such as varying-colored lighting and environment
lighting. It can successfully capture distant indirect illumination and
simulates the interreflections between textured surfaces well (i.e., color
bleeding effects); it can also effectively handle new scenes that are not
present in the training dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08826v1,,False
Efficient Agent: Optimizing Planning Capability for Multimodal Retrieval Augmented Generation,12/08/2025,"Yuechen Wang, Yuming Qiao, Dan Meng, Jun Yang, Haonan Lu, Zhenyu Yang, Xudong Zhang","Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08816v1,,False
TempOpt -- Unsupervised Alarm Relation Learning for Telecommunication Networks,12/08/2025,"Sathiyanaryanan Sampath, Pratyush Uppuluri, Thirumaran Ekambaram","In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08814v1,10.1109/INDICON63790.2024.10958479,False
ReQuestNet: A Foundational Learning model for Channel Estimation,12/08/2025,"Kumar Pratik, Pouriya Sadeghi, Gabriele Cesa, Sanaz Barghi, Joseph B. Soriaga, Yuanning Yu, Supratik Bhattacharjee, Arash Behboodi","In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation
(CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network
(ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless
communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource
block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups
(PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a
single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides
it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for
example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by
jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown
precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet
followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive
(Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet
channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded
PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel
spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet
significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a
wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB
gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen
channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations
under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08790v1,,False
Visual Prompting for Robotic Manipulation with Annotation-Guided Pick-and-Place Using ACT,12/08/2025,"Muhammad A. Muttaqien, Tomohiro Motoda, Ryo Hanai, Yukiyasu Domae","Robotic pick-and-place tasks in convenience stores pose challenges due to
dense object arrangements, occlusions, and variations in object properties such
as color, shape, size, and texture. These factors complicate trajectory
planning and grasping. This paper introduces a perception-action pipeline
leveraging annotation-guided visual prompting, where bounding box annotations
identify both pickable objects and placement locations, providing structured
spatial guidance. Instead of traditional step-by-step planning, we employ
Action Chunking with Transformers (ACT) as an imitation learning algorithm,
enabling the robotic arm to predict chunked action sequences from human
demonstrations. This facilitates smooth, adaptive, and data-driven
pick-and-place operations. We evaluate our system based on success rate and
visual analysis of grasping behavior, demonstrating improved grasp accuracy and
adaptability in retail environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08748v1,,False
Simulating Generative Social Agents via Theory-Informed Workflow Design,12/08/2025,"Yuwei Yan, Jinghua Piao, Xiaochong Lan, Chenyang Shao, Pan Hui, Yong Li","Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08726v1,,False
IROTE: Human-like Traits Elicitation of Large Language Model via In-Context Self-Reflective Optimization,12/08/2025,"Yuzhuo Bai, Shitong Duan, Muhua Huang, Jing Yao, Zhenghao Liu, Peng Zhang, Tun Lu, Xiaoyuan Yi, Maosong Sun, Xing Xie","Trained on various human-authored corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have
demonstrated a certain capability of reflecting specific human-like traits
(e.g., personality or values) by prompting, benefiting applications like
personalized LLMs and social simulations. However, existing methods suffer from
the superficial elicitation problem: LLMs can only be steered to mimic shallow
and unstable stylistic patterns, failing to embody the desired traits precisely
and consistently across diverse tasks like humans. To address this challenge,
we propose IROTE, a novel in-context method for stable and transferable trait
elicitation. Drawing on psychological theories suggesting that traits are
formed through identity-related reflection, our method automatically generates
and optimizes a textual self-reflection within prompts, which comprises
self-perceived experience, to stimulate LLMs' trait-driven behavior. The
optimization is performed by iteratively maximizing an information-theoretic
objective that enhances the connections between LLMs' behavior and the target
trait, while reducing noisy redundancy in reflection without any fine-tuning,
leading to evocative and compact trait reflection. Extensive experiments across
three human trait systems manifest that one single IROTE-generated
self-reflection can induce LLMs' stable impersonation of the target trait
across diverse downstream tasks beyond simple questionnaire answering,
consistently outperforming existing strong baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08719v1,,False
Expert-Guided Diffusion Planner for Auto-bidding,12/08/2025,"Yunshan Peng, Wenzheng Shu, Jiahao Sun, Yanxiang Zeng, Jinan Pang, Wentao Bai, Yunke Bai, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang","Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08687v1,,False
In-Context Learning as Nonparametric Conditional Probability Estimation: Risk Bounds and Optimality,12/08/2025,"Chenrui Liu, Falong Tan, Chuanlong Xie, Yicheng Zeng, Lixing Zhu","This paper investigates the expected excess risk of In-Context Learning (ICL)
for multiclass classification. We model each task as a sequence of labeled
prompt samples and a query input, where a pre-trained model estimates the
conditional class probabilities of the query. The expected excess risk is
defined as the average truncated Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the
predicted and ground-truth conditional class distributions, averaged over a
specified family of tasks. We establish a new oracle inequality for the
expected excess risk based on KL divergence in multiclass classification. This
allows us to derive tight upper and lower bounds for the expected excess risk
in transformer-based models, demonstrating that the ICL estimator achieves the
minimax optimal rate - up to a logarithmic factor - for conditional probability
estimation. From a technical standpoint, our results introduce a novel method
for controlling generalization error using the uniform empirical covering
entropy of the log-likelihood function class. Furthermore, we show that
multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) can also perform ICL and achieve this optimal
rate under specific assumptions, suggesting that transformers may not be the
exclusive architecture capable of effective ICL.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08673v1,,False
UGM2N: An Unsupervised and Generalizable Mesh Movement Network via M-Uniform Loss,12/08/2025,"Zhichao Wang, Xinhai Chen, Qinglin Wang, Xiang Gao, Qingyang Zhang, Menghan Jia, Xiang Zhang, Jie Liu","Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,

Yan: Foundational Interactive Video Generation,12/08/2025,Yan Team,"We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
