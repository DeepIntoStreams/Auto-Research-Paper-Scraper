RedSage: A Cybersecurity Generalist LLM,29/01/2026,"Naufal Suryanto, Muzammal Naseer, Pengfei Li, Syed Talal Wasim, Jinhui Yi, Juergen Gall, Paolo Ceravolo, Ernesto Damiani","Cybersecurity operations demand assistant LLMs that support diverse workflows without exposing sensitive data. Existing solutions either rely on proprietary APIs with privacy risks or on open models lacking domain adaptation. To bridge this gap, we curate 11.8B tokens of cybersecurity-focused continual pretraining data via large-scale web filtering and manual collection of high-quality resources, spanning 28.6K documents across frameworks, offensive techniques, and security tools. Building on this, we design an agentic augmentation pipeline that simulates expert workflows to generate 266K multi-turn cybersecurity samples for supervised fine-tuning. Combined with general open-source LLM data, these resources enable the training of RedSage, an open-source, locally deployable cybersecurity assistant with domain-aware pretraining and post-training. To rigorously evaluate the models, we introduce RedSage-Bench, a benchmark with 30K multiple-choice and 240 open-ended Q&A items covering cybersecurity knowledge, skills, and tool expertise. RedSage is further evaluated on established cybersecurity benchmarks (e.g., CTI-Bench, CyberMetric, SECURE) and general LLM benchmarks to assess broader generalization. At the 8B scale, RedSage achieves consistently better results, surpassing the baseline models by up to +5.59 points on cybersecurity benchmarks and +5.05 points on Open LLM Leaderboard tasks. These findings demonstrate that domain-aware agentic augmentation and pre/post-training can not only enhance cybersecurity-specific expertise but also help to improve general reasoning and instruction-following. All models, datasets, and code are publicly available.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22159v1,,False
Hybrid Linear Attention Done Right: Efficient Distillation and Effective Architectures for Extremely Long Contexts,29/01/2026,"Yingfa Chen, Zhen Leng Thai, Zihan Zhou, Zhu Zhang, Xingyu Shen, Shuo Wang, Chaojun Xiao, Xu Han, Zhiyuan Liu","Hybrid Transformer architectures, which combine softmax attention blocks and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), have shown a desirable performance-throughput tradeoff for long-context modeling, but their adoption and studies are hindered by the prohibitive cost of large-scale pre-training from scratch. Some recent studies have shown that pre-trained softmax attention blocks can be converted into RNN blocks through parameter transfer and knowledge distillation. However, these transfer methods require substantial amounts of training data (more than 10B tokens), and the resulting hybrid models also exhibit poor long-context performance, which is the scenario where hybrid models enjoy significant inference speedups over Transformer-based models. In this paper, we present HALO (Hybrid Attention via Layer Optimization), a pipeline for distilling Transformer models into RNN-attention hybrid models. We then present HypeNet, a hybrid architecture with superior length generalization enabled by a novel position encoding scheme (named HyPE) and various architectural modifications. We convert the Qwen3 series into HypeNet using HALO, achieving performance comparable to the original Transformer models while enjoying superior long-context performance and efficiency. The conversion requires just 2.3B tokens, less than 0.01% of their pre-training data",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22156v1,,False
DynaWeb: Model-Based Reinforcement Learning of Web Agents,29/01/2026,"Hang Ding, Peidong Liu, Junqiao Wang, Ziwei Ji, Meng Cao, Rongzhao Zhang, Lynn Ai, Eric Yang, Tianyu Shi, Lei Yu","The development of autonomous web agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), represents a significant step towards general-purpose AI assistants. However, training these agents is severely hampered by the challenges of interacting with the live internet, which is inefficient, costly, and fraught with risks. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) offers a promising solution by learning a world model of the environment to enable simulated interaction. This paper introduces DynaWeb, a novel MBRL framework that trains web agents through interacting with a web world model trained to predict naturalistic web page representations given agent actions. This model serves as a synthetic web environment where an agent policy can dream by generating vast quantities of rollout action trajectories for efficient online reinforcement learning. Beyond free policy rollouts, DynaWeb incorporates real expert trajectories from training data, which are randomly interleaved with on-policy rollouts during training to improve stability and sample efficiency. Experiments conducted on the challenging WebArena and WebVoyager benchmarks demonstrate that DynaWeb consistently and significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art open-source web agent models. Our findings establish the viability of training web agents through imagination, offering a scalable and efficient way to scale up online agentic RL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22149v1,,False
Reasoning While Asking: Transforming Reasoning Large Language Models from Passive Solvers to Proactive Inquirers,29/01/2026,"Xin Chen, Feng Jiang, Yiqian Zhang, Hardy Chen, Shuo Yan, Wenya Xie, Min Yang, Shujian Huang","Reasoning-oriented Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, yet they remain fundamentally limited by a \emph{blind self-thinking} paradigm: performing extensive internal reasoning even when critical information is missing or ambiguous. We propose Proactive Interactive Reasoning (PIR), a new reasoning paradigm that transforms LLMs from passive solvers into proactive inquirers that interleave reasoning with clarification. Unlike existing search- or tool-based frameworks that primarily address knowledge uncertainty by querying external environments, PIR targets premise- and intent-level uncertainty through direct interaction with the user. PIR is implemented via two core components: (1) an uncertainty-aware supervised fine-tuning procedure that equips models with interactive reasoning capability, and (2) a user-simulator-based policy optimization framework driven by a composite reward that aligns model behavior with user intent. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning, code generation, and document editing demonstrate that PIR consistently outperforms strong baselines, achieving up to 32.70\% higher accuracy, 22.90\% higher pass rate, and 41.36 BLEU improvement, while reducing nearly half of the reasoning computation and unnecessary interaction turns. Further reliability evaluations on factual knowledge, question answering, and missing-premise scenarios confirm the strong generalization and robustness of PIR.

World of Workflows: a Benchmark for Bringing World Models to Enterprise Systems,29/01/2026,"Lakshya Gupta, Litao Li, Yizhe Liu, Sriram Ganapathi Subramanian, Kaheer Suleman, Zichen Zhang, Haoye Lu, Sumit Pasupalak","Frontier large language models (LLMs) excel as autonomous agents in many domains, yet they remain untested in complex enterprise systems where hidden workflows create cascading effects across interconnected databases. Existing enterprise benchmarks evaluate surface-level agentic task completion similar to general consumer benchmarks, ignoring true challenges in enterprises, such as limited observability, large database state, and hidden workflows with cascading side effects. We introduce World of Workflows (WoW), a realistic ServiceNow-based environment incorporating 4,000+ business rules and 55 active workflows embedded in the system, alongside WoW-bench, a benchmark of 234 tasks evaluating constrained agentic task completion and enterprise dynamics modeling capabilities. We reveal two major takeaways: (1) Frontier LLMs suffer from dynamics blindness, consistently failing to predict the invisible, cascading side effects of their actions, which leads to silent constraint violations, and (2) reliability in opaque systems requires grounded world modeling, where agents must mentally simulate hidden state transitions to bridge the observability gap when high-fidelity feedback is unavailable.

Learning Hamiltonian Flow Maps: Mean Flow Consistency for Large-Timestep Molecular Dynamics,29/01/2026,"Winfried Ripken, Michael Plainer, Gregor Lied, Thorben Frank, Oliver T. Unke, Stefan Chmiela, Frank Noé, Klaus Robert Müller","Simulating the long-time evolution of Hamiltonian systems is limited by the small timesteps required for stable numerical integration. To overcome this constraint, we introduce a framework to learn Hamiltonian Flow Maps by predicting the mean phase-space evolution over a chosen time span $Δt$, enabling stable large-timestep updates far beyond the stability limits of classical integrators. To this end, we impose a Mean Flow consistency condition for time-averaged Hamiltonian dynamics. Unlike prior approaches, this allows training on independent phase-space samples without access to future states, avoiding expensive trajectory generation. Validated across diverse Hamiltonian systems, our method in particular improves upon molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learned force fields (MLFF). Our models maintain comparable training and inference cost, but support significantly larger integration timesteps while trained directly on widely-available trajectory-free MLFF datasets.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22123v1,,False
Diverse Approaches to Optimal Execution Schedule Generation,29/01/2026,"Robert de Witt, Mikko S. Pakkanen","We present the first application of MAP-Elites, a quality-diversity algorithm, to trade execution. Rather than searching for a single optimal policy, MAP-Elites generates a diverse portfolio of regime-specialist strategies indexed by liquidity and volatility conditions. Individual specialists achieve 8-10% performance improvements within their behavioural niches, while other cells show degradation, suggesting opportunities for ensemble approaches that combine improved specialists with the baseline PPO policy. Results indicate that quality-diversity methods offer promise for regime-adaptive execution, though substantial computational resources per behavioural cell may be required for robust specialist development across all market conditions. To ensure experimental integrity, we develop a calibrated Gymnasium environment focused on order scheduling rather than tactical placement decisions. The simulator features a transient impact model with exponential decay and square-root volume scaling, fit to 400+ U.S. equities with R^2>0.02 out-of-sample. Within this environment, two Proximal Policy Optimization architectures - both MLP and CNN feature extractors - demonstrate substantial improvements over industry baselines, with the CNN variant achieving 2.13 bps arrival slippage versus 5.23 bps for VWAP on 4,900 out-of-sample orders ($21B notional). These results validate both the simulation realism and provide strong single-policy baselines for quality-diversity methods.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22113v1,,False
Physics Informed Reconstruction of Four-Dimensional Atmospheric Wind Fields Using Multi-UAS Swarm Observations in a Synthetic Turbulent Environment,29/01/2026,"Abdullah Tasim, Wei Sun","Accurate reconstruction of atmospheric wind fields is essential for applications such as weather forecasting, hazard prediction, and wind energy assessment, yet conventional instruments leave spatio-temporal gaps within the lower atmospheric boundary layer. Unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) provide flexible in situ measurements, but individual platforms sample wind only along their flight trajectories, limiting full wind-field recovery. This study presents a framework for reconstructing four-dimensional atmospheric wind fields using measurements obtained from a coordinated UAS swarm. A synthetic turbulence environment and high-fidelity multirotor simulation are used to generate training and evaluation data. Local wind components are estimated from UAS dynamics using a bidirectional long short-term memory network (Bi-LSTM) and assimilated into a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to reconstruct a continuous wind field in space and time. For local wind estimation, the bidirectional LSTM achieves root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of 0.064 and 0.062 m/s for the north and east components in low-wind conditions, increasing to 0.122 to 0.129 m/s under moderate winds and 0.271 to 0.273 m/s in high-wind conditions, while the vertical component exhibits higher error, with RMSE values of 0.029 to 0.091 m/s. The physics-informed reconstruction recovers the dominant spatial and temporal structure of the wind field up to 1000 m altitude while preserving mean flow direction and vertical shear. Under moderate wind conditions, the reconstructed mean wind field achieves an overall RMSE between 0.118 and 0.154 m/s across evaluated UAS configurations, with the lowest error obtained using a five-UAS swarm. These results demonstrate that coordinated UAS measurements enable accurate and scalable four-dimensional wind-field reconstruction without dedicated wind sensors or fixed infrastructure.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22111v1,,False
Unsupervised Decomposition and Recombination with Discriminator-Driven Diffusion Models,29/01/2026,"Archer Wang, Emile Anand, Yilun Du, Marin Soljačić","Decomposing complex data into factorized representations can reveal reusable components and enable synthesizing new samples via component recombination. We investigate this in the context of diffusion-based models that learn factorized latent spaces without factor-level supervision. In images, factors can capture background, illumination, and object attributes; in robotic videos, they can capture reusable motion components. To improve both latent factor discovery and quality of compositional generation, we introduce an adversarial training signal via a discriminator trained to distinguish between single-source samples and those generated by recombining factors across sources. By optimizing the generator to fool this discriminator, we encourage physical and semantic consistency in the resulting recombinations. Our method outperforms implementations of prior baselines on CelebA-HQ, Virtual KITTI, CLEVR, and Falcor3D, achieving lower FID scores and better disentanglement as measured by MIG and MCC. Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel application to robotic video trajectories: by recombining learned action components, we generate diverse sequences that significantly increase state-space coverage for exploration on the LIBERO benchmark.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22057v1,,False
SIA: Symbolic Interpretability for Anticipatory Deep Reinforcement Learning in Network Control,29/01/2026,"MohammadErfan Jabbari, Abhishek Duttagupta, Claudio Fiandrino, Leonardo Bonati, Salvatore D'Oro, Michele Polese, Marco Fiore, Tommaso Melodia","Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) promises adaptive control for future mobile networks but conventional agents remain reactive: they act on past and current measurements and cannot leverage short-term forecasts of exogenous KPIs such as bandwidth. Augmenting agents with predictions can overcome this temporal myopia, yet uptake in networking is scarce because forecast-aware agents act as closed-boxes; operators cannot tell whether predictions guide decisions or justify the added complexity. We propose SIA, the first interpreter that exposes in real time how forecast-augmented DRL agents operate. SIA fuses Symbolic AI abstractions with per-KPI Knowledge Graphs to produce explanations, and includes a new Influence Score metric. SIA achieves sub-millisecond speed, over 200x faster than existing XAI methods. We evaluate SIA on three diverse networking use cases, uncovering hidden issues, including temporal misalignment in forecast integration and reward-design biases that trigger counter-productive policies. These insights enable targeted fixes: a redesigned agent achieves a 9% higher average bitrate in video streaming, and SIA's online Action-Refinement module improves RAN-slicing reward by 25% without retraining. By making anticipatory DRL transparent and tunable, SIA lowers the barrier to proactive control in next-generation mobile networks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.22044v1,,False
PowerGenie: Analytically-Guided Evolutionary Discovery of Superior Reconfigurable Power Converters,29/01/2026,"Jian Gao, Yiwei Zou, Abhishek Pradhan, Wenhao Huang, Yumin Su, Kaiyuan Yang, Xuan Zhang","Discovering superior circuit topologies requires navigating an exponentially large design space-a challenge traditionally reserved for human experts. Existing AI methods either select from predefined templates or generate novel topologies at a limited scale without rigorous verification, leaving large-scale performance-driven discovery underexplored. We present PowerGenie, a framework for automated discovery of higher-performance reconfigurable power converters at scale. PowerGenie introduces: (1) an automated analytical framework that determines converter functionality and theoretical performance limits without component sizing or SPICE simulation, and (2) an evolutionary finetuning method that co-evolves a generative model with its training distribution through fitness selection and uniqueness verification. Unlike existing methods that suffer from mode collapse and overfitting, our approach achieves higher syntax validity, function validity, novelty rate, and figure-of-merit (FoM). PowerGenie discovers a novel 8-mode reconfigurable converter with 23% higher FoM than the best training topology.

From Particles to Agents: Hallucination as a Metric for Cognitive Friction in Spatial Simulation,29/01/2026,"Javier Argota Sánchez-Vaquerizo, Luis Borunda Monsivais","Traditional architectural simulations (e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics, evacuation, structural analysis) model elements as deterministic physics-based ""particles"" rather than cognitive ""agents"". To bridge this, we introduce \textbf{Agentic Environmental Simulations}, where Large Multimodal generative models actively predict the next state of spatial environments based on semantic expectation. Drawing on examples from accessibility-oriented AR pipelines and multimodal digital twins, we propose a shift from chronological time-steps to Episodic Spatial Reasoning, where simulations advance through meaningful, surprisal-triggered events. Within this framework we posit AI hallucinations as diagnostic tools. By formalizing the \textbf{Cognitive Friction} ($C_f$) it is possible to reveal ""Phantom Affordances"", i.e. semiotic ambiguities in built space. Finally, we challenge current HCI paradigms by treating environments as dynamic cognitive partners and propose a human-centered framework of cognitive orchestration for designing AI-driven simulations that preserve autonomy, affective clarity, and cognitive integrity.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21977v1,,False
ToolWeaver: Weaving Collaborative Semantics for Scalable Tool Use in Large Language Models,29/01/2026,"Bowen Fang, Wen Ye, Yunyue Su, Jinghao Zhang, Qiang Liu, Yesheng Liu, Xin Sun, Shu Wu, Jiabing Yang, Baole Wei, Liang Wang","Prevalent retrieval-based tool-use pipelines struggle with a dual semantic challenge: their retrievers often employ encoders that fail to capture complex semantics, while the Large Language Model (LLM) itself lacks intrinsic tool knowledge from its natural language pretraining. Generative methods offer a powerful alternative by unifying selection and execution, tasking the LLM to directly learn and generate tool identifiers. However, the common practice of mapping each tool to a unique new token introduces substantial limitations: it creates a scalability and generalization crisis, as the vocabulary size explodes and each tool is assigned a semantically isolated token. This approach also creates a semantic bottleneck that hinders the learning of collaborative tool relationships, as the model must infer them from sparse co-occurrences of monolithic tool IDs within a vast library. To address these limitations, we propose ToolWeaver, a novel generative tool learning framework that encodes tools into hierarchical sequences. This approach makes vocabulary expansion logarithmic to the number of tools. Crucially, it enables the model to learn collaborative patterns from the dense co-occurrence of shared codes, rather than the sparse co-occurrence of monolithic tool IDs. We generate these structured codes through a novel tokenization process designed to weave together a tool's intrinsic semantics with its extrinsic co-usage patterns. These structured codes are then integrated into the LLM through a generative alignment stage, where the model is fine-tuned to produce the hierarchical code sequences. Evaluation results with nearly 47,000 tools show that ToolWeaver significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, establishing a more scalable, generalizable, and semantically-aware foundation for advanced tool-augmented agents.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21947v1,,False
Robust Multimodal Representation Learning in Healthcare,29/01/2026,"Xiaoguang Zhu, Linxiao Gong, Lianlong Sun, Yang Liu, Haoyu Wang, Jing Liu","Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous data into unified patient representations to support clinical outcome prediction. However, real-world medical datasets commonly contain systematic biases from multiple sources, which poses significant challenges for medical multimodal representation learning. Existing approaches typically focus on effective multimodal fusion, neglecting inherent biased features that affect the generalization ability. To address these challenges, we propose a Dual-Stream Feature Decorrelation Framework that identifies and handles the biases through structural causal analysis introduced by latent confounders. Our method employs a causal-biased decorrelation framework with dual-stream neural networks to disentangle causal features from spurious correlations, utilizing generalized cross-entropy loss and mutual information minimization for effective decorrelation. The framework is model-agnostic and can be integrated into existing medical multimodal learning methods. Comprehensive experiments on MIMIC-IV, eICU, and ADNI datasets demonstrate consistent performance improvements.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21941v1,,False
AgenticSimLaw: A Juvenile Courtroom Multi-Agent Debate Simulation for Explainable High-Stakes Tabular Decision Making,29/01/2026,"Jon Chun, Kathrine Elkins, Yong Suk Lee","We introduce AgenticSimLaw, a role-structured, multi-agent debate framework that provides transparent and controllable test-time reasoning for high-stakes tabular decision-making tasks. Unlike black-box approaches, our courtroom-style orchestration explicitly defines agent roles (prosecutor, defense, judge), interaction protocols (7-turn structured debate), and private reasoning strategies, creating a fully auditable decision-making process. We benchmark this framework on young adult recidivism prediction using the NLSY97 dataset, comparing it against traditional chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across almost 90 unique combinations of models and strategies. Our results demonstrate that structured multi-agent debate provides more stable and generalizable performance compared to single-agent reasoning, with stronger correlation between accuracy and F1-score metrics. Beyond performance improvements, AgenticSimLaw offers fine-grained control over reasoning steps, generates complete interaction transcripts for explainability, and enables systematic profiling of agent behaviors. While we instantiate this framework in the criminal justice domain to stress-test reasoning under ethical complexity, the approach generalizes to any deliberative, high-stakes decision task requiring transparency and human oversight. This work addresses key LLM-based multi-agent system challenges: organization through structured roles, observability through logged interactions, and responsibility through explicit non-deployment constraints for sensitive domains.

Improving Classifier-Free Guidance of Flow Matching via Manifold Projection,29/01/2026,"Jian-Feng Cai, Haixia Liu, Zhengyi Su, Chao Wang","Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for controllable generation in diffusion and flow-based models. Despite its empirical success, CFG relies on a heuristic linear extrapolation that is often sensitive to the guidance scale. In this work, we provide a principled interpretation of CFG through the lens of optimization. We demonstrate that the velocity field in flow matching corresponds to the gradient of a sequence of smoothed distance functions, which guides latent variables toward the scaled target image set. This perspective reveals that the standard CFG formulation is an approximation of this gradient, where the prediction gap, the discrepancy between conditional and unconditional outputs, governs guidance sensitivity. Leveraging this insight, we reformulate the CFG sampling as a homotopy optimization with a manifold constraint. This formulation necessitates a manifold projection step, which we implement via an incremental gradient descent scheme during sampling. To improve computational efficiency and stability, we further enhance this iterative process with Anderson Acceleration without requiring additional model evaluations. Our proposed methods are training-free and consistently refine generation fidelity, prompt alignment, and robustness to the guidance scale. We validate their effectiveness across diverse benchmarks, demonstrating significant improvements on large-scale models such as DiT-XL-2-256, Flux, and Stable Diffusion 3.5.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21892v1,,False
VSE: Variational state estimation of complex model-free process,29/01/2026,"Gustav Norén, Anubhab Ghosh, Fredrik Cumlin, Saikat Chatterjee","We design a variational state estimation (VSE) method that provides a closed-form Gaussian posterior of an underlying complex dynamical process from (noisy) nonlinear measurements. The complex process is model-free. That is, we do not have a suitable physics-based model characterizing the temporal evolution of the process state. The closed-form Gaussian posterior is provided by a recurrent neural network (RNN). The use of RNN is computationally simple in the inference phase. For learning the RNN, an additional RNN is used in the learning phase. Both RNNs help each other learn better based on variational inference principles. The VSE is demonstrated for a tracking application - state estimation of a stochastic Lorenz system (a benchmark process) using a 2-D camera measurement model. The VSE is shown to be competitive against a particle filter that knows the Lorenz system model and a recently proposed data-driven state estimation method that does not know the Lorenz system model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21887v1,,False
MoHETS: Long-term Time Series Forecasting with Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts,29/01/2026,"Evandro S. Ortigossa, Guy Lutsker, Eran Segal","Real-world multivariate time series can exhibit intricate multi-scale structures, including global trends, local periodicities, and non-stationary regimes, which makes long-horizon forecasting challenging. Although sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approaches improve scalability and specialization, they typically rely on homogeneous MLP experts that poorly capture the diverse temporal dynamics of time series data. We address these limitations with MoHETS, an encoder-only Transformer that integrates sparse Mixture-of-Heterogeneous-Experts (MoHE) layers. MoHE routes temporal patches to a small subset of expert networks, combining a shared depthwise-convolution expert for sequence-level continuity with routed Fourier-based experts for patch-level periodic structures. MoHETS further improves robustness to non-stationary dynamics by incorporating exogenous information via cross-attention over covariate patch embeddings. Finally, we replace parameter-heavy linear projection heads with a lightweight convolutional patch decoder, improving parameter efficiency, reducing training instability, and allowing a single model to generalize across arbitrary forecast horizons. We validate across seven multivariate benchmarks and multiple horizons, with MoHETS consistently achieving state-of-the-art performance, reducing the average MSE by $12\%$ compared to strong recent baselines, demonstrating effective heterogeneous specialization for long-term forecasting.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21866v1,,False
Bridging Forecast Accuracy and Inventory KPIs: A Simulation-Based Software Framework,29/01/2026,"So Fukuhara, Abdallah Alabdallah, Nuwan Gunasekara, Slawomir Nowaczyk","Efficient management of spare parts inventory is crucial in the automotive aftermarket, where demand is highly intermittent and uncertainty drives substantial cost and service risks. Forecasting is therefore central, but the quality of a forecasting model should be judged not by statistical accuracy (e.g., MAE, RMSE, IAE) but rather by its impact on key operational performance indicators (KPIs), such as total cost and service level. Yet most existing work evaluates models exclusively using accuracy metrics, and the relationship between these metrics and operational KPIs remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we propose a decision-centric simulation software framework that enables systematic evaluation of forecasting model in realistic inventory management setting. The framework comprises: (i) a synthetic demand generator tailored to spare-parts demand characteristics, (ii) a flexible forecasting module that can host arbitrary predictive models, and (iii) an inventory control simulator that consumes the forecasts and computes operational KPIs. This closed-loop setup enables researchers to evaluate models not only in terms of statistical error but also in terms of their downstream implications for inventory decisions. Using a wide range of simulation scenarios, we show that improvements in conventional accuracy metrics do not necessarily translate into better operational performance, and that models with similar statistical error profiles can induce markedly different cost-service trade-offs. We analyze these discrepancies to characterize how specific aspects of forecast performance affect inventory outcomes and derive guidance for model selection. Overall, the framework operationalizes the link between demand forecasting and inventory management, shifting evaluation from purely predictive accuracy toward operational relevance in the automotive aftermarket and related domains.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21844v1,,False
Mean-field Variational Bayes for Sparse Probit Regression,29/01/2026,"Augusto Fasano, Giovanni Rebaudo","We consider Bayesian variable selection for binary outcomes under a probit link with a spike-and-slab prior on the regression coefficients. Motivated by the computational challenges encountered by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) samplers in high-dimensional regimes, we develop a mean-field variational Bayes approximation in which all variational factors admit closed-form updates, and the evidence lower bound is available in closed form. This, in turn, allows the development of an efficient coordinate ascent variational inference algorithm to find the optimal values of the variational parameters. The approach produces posterior inclusion probabilities and parameter estimates, enabling interpretable selection and prediction within a single framework. As shown in both simulated and real data applications, the proposed method successfully identifies the important variables and is orders of magnitude faster than MCMC, while maintaining comparable accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21765v1,,False
Procedural Pretraining: Warming Up Language Models with Abstract Data,29/01/2026,"Liangze Jiang, Zachary Shinnick, Anton van den Hengel, Hemanth Saratchandran, Damien Teney","Pretraining directly on web-scale corpora is the de facto paradigm for building language models. We study an alternative setting where the model is initially exposed to abstract structured data, as a means to ease the subsequent acquisition of rich semantic knowledge, much like humans learn simple logic and mathematics before higher reasoning. We specifically focus on procedural data, generated by formal languages and other simple algorithms, as such abstract data.
  We first diagnose the algorithmic skills that different forms of procedural data can improve, often significantly. For example, on context recall (Needle-in-a-haystack), the accuracy jumps from 10 to 98% when pretraining on Dyck sequences (balanced brackets). Second, we study how these gains are reflected in pretraining larger models (up to 1.3B). We find that front-loading as little as 0.1% procedural data significantly outperforms standard pretraining on natural language, code, and informal mathematics (C4, CodeParrot, and DeepMind-Math datasets). Notably, this procedural pretraining enables the models to reach the same loss value with only 55, 67, 86% of the original data. Third, we explore the mechanisms behind and find that procedural pretraining instils non-trivial structure in both attention and MLP layers. The former is particularly important for structured domains (e.g. code), and the latter for language. Finally, we lay a path for combining multiple forms of procedural data. Our results show that procedural pretraining is a simple, lightweight means to improving performance and accelerating language model pretraining, ultimately suggesting the promise of disentangling knowledge acquisition from reasoning in LLMs.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21725v1,,False
DreamActor-M2: Universal Character Image Animation via Spatiotemporal In-Context Learning,29/01/2026,"Mingshuang Luo, Shuang Liang, Zhengkun Rong, Yuxuan Luo, Tianshu Hu, Ruibing Hou, Hong Chang, Yong Li, Yuan Zhang, Mingyuan Gao","Character image animation aims to synthesize high-fidelity videos by transferring motion from a driving sequence to a static reference image. Despite recent advancements, existing methods suffer from two fundamental challenges: (1) suboptimal motion injection strategies that lead to a trade-off between identity preservation and motion consistency, manifesting as a ""see-saw"", and (2) an over-reliance on explicit pose priors (e.g., skeletons), which inadequately capture intricate dynamics and hinder generalization to arbitrary, non-humanoid characters. To address these challenges, we present DreamActor-M2, a universal animation framework that reimagines motion conditioning as an in-context learning problem. Our approach follows a two-stage paradigm. First, we bridge the input modality gap by fusing reference appearance and motion cues into a unified latent space, enabling the model to jointly reason about spatial identity and temporal dynamics by leveraging the generative prior of foundational models. Second, we introduce a self-bootstrapped data synthesis pipeline that curates pseudo cross-identity training pairs, facilitating a seamless transition from pose-dependent control to direct, end-to-end RGB-driven animation. This strategy significantly enhances generalization across diverse characters and motion scenarios. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we further introduce AW Bench, a versatile benchmark encompassing a wide spectrum of characters types and motion scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DreamActor-M2 achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering superior visual fidelity and robust cross-domain generalization.

Disentangling perception and reasoning for improving data efficiency in learning cloth manipulation without demonstrations,29/01/2026,"Donatien Delehelle, Fei Chen, Darwin Caldwell","Cloth manipulation is a ubiquitous task in everyday life, but it remains an open challenge for robotics. The difficulties in developing cloth manipulation policies are attributed to the high-dimensional state space, complex dynamics, and high propensity to self-occlusion exhibited by fabrics. As analytical methods have not been able to provide robust and general manipulation policies, reinforcement learning (RL) is considered a promising approach to these problems. However, to address the large state space and complex dynamics, data-based methods usually rely on large models and long training times. The resulting computational cost significantly hampers the development and adoption of these methods. Additionally, due to the challenge of robust state estimation, garment manipulation policies often adopt an end-to-end learning approach with workspace images as input. While this approach enables a conceptually straightforward sim-to-real transfer via real-world fine-tuning, it also incurs a significant computational cost by training agents on a highly lossy representation of the environment state. This paper questions this common design choice by exploring an efficient and modular approach to RL for cloth manipulation. We show that, through careful design choices, model size and training time can be significantly reduced when learning in simulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the resulting simulation-trained model can be transferred to the real world. We evaluate our approach on the SoftGym benchmark and achieve significant performance improvements over available baselines on our task, while using a substantially smaller model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21713v1,,False

Meanwhile, the collected data may be corrupted due to sensor or transmission failure, or it may not have sufficient resolution for downstream tasks. A wide range of generative tasks is formulated to address these issues, including synthetic data generation, missing data imputation, and super-resolution. Despite the success of machine learning models on these tasks, dedicated models need to be designed and trained for each task, leading to redundancy and inefficiency. In this paper, by recognizing the powerful modeling capability of flow matching models, we propose a new approach to unify diverse smart meter data generative tasks with a single model trained for conditional generation. The proposed flow matching models are trained to generate challenging, high-dimensional time series data, specifically monthly smart meter data at a 15 min resolution. By viewing different generative tasks as distinct forms of partial data observations and injecting them into the generation process, we unify tasks such as imputation and super-resolution with a single model, eliminating the need for re-training. The data generated by our model not only are consistent with the given observations but also remain realistic, showing better performance against interpolation and other machine learning based baselines dedicated to the tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21706v1,,False
Curriculum Learning for LLM Pretraining: An Analysis of Learning Dynamics,29/01/2026,"Mohamed Elgaar, Hadi Amiri","Curriculum learning changes the order of pre-training data, but it remains unclear whether it changes the learning trajectory or mainly reorders exposure over a fixed trajectory. We train Pythia models (14M-410M parameters) for 300B tokens under three linguistically motivated curricula-Age-of-Acquisition, word frequency, and Verb Variation (VV)-and compare each against Random ordering; at 1B parameters we compare Random and VV. Across orderings, training follows a shared sequence of latent phases, while curricula mainly change within-phase data exposure. In smaller models (up to 160M parameters), Random ordering exhibits higher gradient noise and stronger late-training output-head spectral saturation, alongside lower final accuracy; curricula reduce both effects at matched compute. At larger scales, saturation differences are smaller and curriculum gains shrink. We formalize the link between difficulty pacing and optimization stability in an idealized analysis based on gradient-variance control, and our results point to a practical takeaway: curricula help by stabilizing within-phase optimization rather than by creating new phases.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21698v1,,False
Independent Component Discovery in Temporal Count Data,29/01/2026,"Alexandre Chaussard, Anna Bonnet, Sylvain Le Corff","Advances in data collection are producing growing volumes of temporal count observations, making adapted modeling increasingly necessary. In this work, we introduce a generative framework for independent component analysis of temporal count data, combining regime-adaptive dynamics with Poisson log-normal emissions. The model identifies disentangled components with regime-dependent contributions, enabling representation learning and perturbations analysis. Notably, we establish the identifiability of the model, supporting principled interpretation. To learn the parameters, we propose an efficient amortized variational inference procedure. Experiments on simulated data evaluate recovery of the mixing function and latent sources across diverse settings, while an in vivo longitudinal gut microbiome study reveals microbial co-variation patterns and regime shifts consistent with clinical perturbations.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21696v1,,False
LLM4Fluid: Large Language Models as Generalizable Neural Solvers for Fluid Dynamics,29/01/2026,"Qisong Xiao, Xinhai Chen, Qinglin Wang, Xiaowei Guo, Binglin Wang, Weifeng Chen, Zhichao Wang, Yunfei Liu, Rui Xia, Hang Zou, Gencheng Liu, Shuai Li, Jie Liu","Deep learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for spatio-temporal modeling of fluid dynamics. However, existing approaches often suffer from limited generalization to unseen flow conditions and typically require retraining when applied to new scenarios. In this paper, we present LLM4Fluid, a spatio-temporal prediction framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as generalizable neural solvers for fluid dynamics. The framework first compresses high-dimensional flow fields into a compact latent space via reduced-order modeling enhanced with a physics-informed disentanglement mechanism, effectively mitigating spatial feature entanglement while preserving essential flow structures. A pretrained LLM then serves as a temporal processor, autoregressively predicting the dynamics of physical sequences with time series prompts. To bridge the modality gap between prompts and physical sequences, which can otherwise degrade prediction accuracy, we propose a dedicated modality alignment strategy that resolves representational mismatch and stabilizes long-term prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse flow scenarios demonstrate that LLM4Fluid functions as a robust and generalizable neural solver without retraining, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy while exhibiting powerful zero-shot and in-context learning capabilities.

ILRR: Inference-Time Steering Method for Masked Diffusion Language Models,29/01/2026,"Eden Avrahami, Eliya Nachmani","Discrete Diffusion Language Models (DLMs) offer a promising non-autoregressive alternative for text generation, yet effective mechanisms for inference-time control remain relatively underexplored. Existing approaches include sampling-level guidance procedures or trajectory optimization mechanisms. In this work, we introduce Iterative Latent Representation Refinement (ILRR), a learning-free framework for steering DLMs using a single reference sequence. ILRR guides generation by dynamically aligning the internal activations of the generated sequence with those of a given reference throughout the denoising process. This approach captures and transfers high-level semantic properties, with a tunable steering scale enabling flexible control over attributes such as sentiment. We further introduce Spatially Modulated Steering, an extension that enables steering long texts using shorter references by regulating guidance intensity across the sequence. Empirically, we demonstrate that ILRR achieves effective attribute steering on LLaDA and MDLM architectures with a minor computational overhead, requiring only one additional parallel forward pass per denoising step. Under the same compute budget, ILRR improves attribute accuracy over comparable baselines by 10$\%$ to 60$\%$ points, while maintaining high generation quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21647v1,,False
Generative Design of Ship Propellers using Conditional Flow Matching,29/01/2026,"Patrick Kruger, Rafael Diaz, Simon Hauschulz, Stefan Harries, Hanno Gottschalk","In this paper, we explore the use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) for ship propeller design. While traditional forward machine learning models predict the performance of mechanical components based on given design parameters, GenAI models aim to generate designs that achieve specified performance targets. In particular, we employ conditional flow matching to establish a bidirectional mapping between design parameters and simulated noise that is conditioned on performance labels. This approach enables the generation of multiple valid designs corresponding to the same performance targets by sampling over the noise vector.
  To support model training, we generate data using a vortex lattice method for numerical simulation and analyze the trade-off between model accuracy and the amount of available data. We further propose data augmentation using pseudo-labels derived from less data-intensive forward surrogate models, which can often improve overall model performance. Finally, we present examples of distinct propeller geometries that exhibit nearly identical performance characteristics, illustrating the versatility and potential of GenAI in engineering design.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21637v1,,False
Reinforcement Learning for Adaptive Composition of Quantum Circuit Optimisation Passes,29/01/2026,"Daniel Mills, Ifan Williams, Jacob Swain, Gabriel Matos, Enrico Rinaldi, Alexander Koziell-Pipe","Many quantum software development kits provide a suite of circuit optimisation passes. These passes have been highly optimised and tested in isolation. However, the order in which they are applied is left to the user, or else defined in general-purpose default pass sequences. While general-purpose sequences miss opportunities for optimisation which are particular to individual circuits, designing pass sequences bespoke to particular circuits requires exceptional knowledge about quantum circuit design and optimisation. Here we propose and demonstrate training a reinforcement learning agent to compose optimisation-pass sequences. In particular the agent's action space consists of passes for two-qubit gate count reduction used in default PyTKET pass sequences. For the circuits in our diverse test set, the (mean, median) fraction of two-qubit gates removed by the agent is $(57.7\%, \ 56.7 \%)$, compared to $(41.8 \%, \ 50.0 \%)$ for the next best default pass sequence.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21629v1,,False
CORDS: Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures,29/01/2026,"Tin Hadži Veljković, Erik Bekkers, Michael Tiemann, Jan-Willem van de Meent","Many learning problems require predicting sets of objects when the number of objects is not known beforehand. Examples include object detection, molecular modeling, and scientific inference tasks such as astrophysical source detection. Existing methods often rely on padded representations or must explicitly infer the set size, which often poses challenges. We present a novel strategy for addressing this challenge by casting prediction of variable-sized sets as a continuous inference problem. Our approach, CORDS (Continuous Representations of Discrete Structures), provides an invertible mapping that transforms a set of spatial objects into continuous fields: a density field that encodes object locations and count, and a feature field that carries their attributes over the same support. Because the mapping is invertible, models operate entirely in field space while remaining exactly decodable to discrete sets. We evaluate CORDS across molecular generation and regression, object detection, simulation-based inference, and a mathematical task involving recovery of local maxima, demonstrating robust handling of unknown set sizes with competitive accuracy.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21583v1,,False

Many approaches are either computationally infeasible or underestimate uncertainty. We investigate \textit{BatchEnsemble} as a general and scalable method for uncertainty estimation across both tabular and time series tasks. To extend BatchEnsemble to sequential modeling, we introduce GRUBE, a novel BatchEnsemble GRU cell. We compare the BatchEnsemble to Monte Carlo dropout and deep ensemble models. Our results show that BatchEnsemble matches the uncertainty estimation performance of deep ensembles, and clearly outperforms Monte Carlo dropout. GRUBE achieves similar or better performance in both prediction and uncertainty estimation. These findings show that BatchEnsemble and GRUBE achieve similar performance with fewer parameters and reduced training and inference time compared to traditional ensembles.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21581v1,,False

However, this scaling capability remains severely bottlenecked by a reliance on labor-intensive manual oversight from intricate reward shaping to hyperparameter tuning across heterogeneous backends. Inspired by LLMs' success in software automation and science discovery, we introduce \textsc{EmboCoach-Bench}, a benchmark evaluating the capacity of LLM agents to autonomously engineer embodied policies. Spanning 32 expert-curated RL and IL tasks, our framework posits executable code as the universal interface. We move beyond static generation to assess a dynamic closed-loop workflow, where agents leverage environment feedback to iteratively draft, debug, and optimize solutions, spanning improvements from physics-informed reward design to policy architectures such as diffusion policies. Extensive evaluations yield three critical insights: (1) autonomous agents can qualitatively surpass human-engineered baselines by 26.5\% in average success rate; (2) agentic workflow with environment feedback effectively strengthens policy development and substantially narrows the performance gap between open-source and proprietary models; and (3) agents exhibit self-correction capabilities for pathological engineering cases, successfully resurrecting task performance from near-total failures through iterative simulation-in-the-loop debugging.

Multi-Modal Time Series Prediction via Mixture of Modulated Experts,29/01/2026,"Lige Zhang, Ali Maatouk, Jialin Chen, Leandros Tassiulas, Rex Ying","Real-world time series exhibit complex and evolving dynamics, making accurate forecasting extremely challenging. Recent multi-modal forecasting methods leverage textual information such as news reports to improve prediction, but most rely on token-level fusion that mixes temporal patches with language tokens in a shared embedding space. However, such fusion can be ill-suited when high-quality time-text pairs are scarce and when time series exhibit substantial variation in scale and characteristics, thus complicating cross-modal alignment. In parallel, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have proven effective for both time series modeling and multi-modal learning, yet many existing MoE-based modality integration methods still depend on token-level fusion. To address this, we propose Expert Modulation, a new paradigm for multi-modal time series prediction that conditions both routing and expert computation on textual signals, enabling direct and efficient cross-modal control over expert behavior. Through comprehensive theoretical analysis and experiments, our proposed method demonstrates substantial improvements in multi-modal time series prediction.

To address these issues, we propose Module-aware Architecture Refinement (MAR), a two-stage framework that integrates State Space Models (SSMs) for linear-time sequence modeling and applies activation sparsification to reduce FFN costs. In addition, to mitigate low information density and temporal mismatch in integrating Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with SSMs, we design the Adaptive Ternary Multi-step Neuron (ATMN) and the Spike-aware Bidirectional Distillation Strategy (SBDS).

SAGE: Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution for Generative Recommendation,29/01/2026,"Yu Xie, Xing Kai Ren, Ying Qi, Hu Yao","While works such as OneRec have validated the scaling laws of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recommender systems, they rely on a cumbersome separate vocabulary. This dependency prevents the model architecture from reusing native LLM vocabularies, resulting in high maintenance costs and poor scalability. In response, we aim to efficiently reuse open-source LLM architectures without constructing a separate tokenization vocabulary. Furthermore, we identify that the optimization strategy of OneRec Gradient Bounded Policy Optimization (GBPO),suffers from a ""Symmetric Conservatism"" problem: its static gradient boundaries structurally suppress the update momentum required for cold-start items and fail to prevent diversity collapse in high-noise environments.To address this issue, we propose SAGE (Sequence-level Adaptive Gradient Evolution), a unified optimization framework tailored for list-wise generative recommendation. SAGE introduces two key innovations:(1) Sequence-level Signal Decoupling: By combining a geometric mean importance ratio with decoupled multi-objective advantages, we eliminate token-level variance and resolve the ""Reward Collapse"" problem. (2) Asymmetric Adaptive Dynamics: We construct a dynamic gradient manifold that applies a ""Boost Factor"" to high-potential cold start items to achieve super-linear updates and employs an ""Entropy Aware Penalty"" to break information cocoons.

"DA-SPS: A Dual-stage Network based on Singular Spectrum Analysis, Patching-strategy and Spearman-correlation for Multivariate Time-series Prediction",29/01/2026,"Tianhao Zhang, Shusen Ma, Yu Kang, Yun-Bo Zhao","Multivariate time-series forecasting, as a typical problem in the field of time series prediction, has a wide range of applications in weather forecasting, traffic flow prediction, and other scenarios. However, existing works do not effectively consider the impact of extraneous variables on the prediction of the target variable. On the other hand, they fail to fully extract complex sequence information based on various time patterns of the sequences. To address these drawbacks, we propose a DA-SPS model, which adopts different modules for feature extraction based on the information characteristics of different variables. DA-SPS mainly consists of two stages: the target variable processing stage (TVPS) and the extraneous variables processing stage (EVPS). In TVPS, the model first uses Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) to process the target variable sequence and then uses Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and P-Conv-LSTM which deploys a patching strategy to extract features from trend and seasonality components, respectively. In EVPS, the model filters extraneous variables that have a strong correlation with the target variate by using Spearman correlation analysis and further analyses them using the L-Attention module which consists of LSTM and attention mechanism. Finally, the results obtained by TVPS and EVPS are combined through weighted summation and linear mapping to produce the final prediction. The results on four public datasets demonstrate that the DA-SPS model outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

NEMO: Execution-Aware Optimization Modeling via Autonomous Coding Agents,29/01/2026,"Yang Song, Anoushka Vyas, Zirui Wei, Sina Khoshfetrat Pakazad, Henrik Ohlsson, Graham Neubig","In this paper, we present NEMO, a system that translates Natural-language descriptions of decision problems into formal Executable Mathematical Optimization implementations, operating collaboratively with users or autonomously. Existing approaches typically rely on specialized large language models (LLMs) or bespoke, task-specific agents. Such methods are often brittle, complex and frequently generating syntactically invalid or non-executable code.
  NEMO instead centers on remote interaction with autonomous coding agents (ACAs), treated as a first-class abstraction analogous to API-based interaction with LLMs. This design enables the construction of higher-level systems around ACAs that structure, consolidate, and iteratively refine task specifications. Because ACAs execute within sandboxed environments, code produced by NEMO is executable by construction, allowing automated validation and repair.
  Building on this, we introduce novel coordination patterns with and across ACAs, including asymmetric validation loops between independently generated optimizer and simulator implementations (serving as a high-level validation mechanism), external memory for experience reuse, and robustness enhancements via minimum Bayes risk (MBR) decoding and self-consistency.

Self-Improving Pretraining: using post-trained models to pretrain better models,29/01/2026,"Ellen Xiaoqing Tan, Shehzaad Dhuliawala, Jing Xu, Ping Yu, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar, Jason Weston, Olga Golovneva","Ensuring safety, factuality and overall quality in the generations of large language models is a critical challenge, especially as these models are increasingly deployed in real-world applications. The prevailing approach to addressing these issues involves collecting expensive, carefully curated datasets and applying multiple stages of fine-tuning and alignment. However, even this complex pipeline cannot guarantee the correction of patterns learned during pretraining. Therefore, addressing these issues during pretraining is crucial, as it shapes a model's core behaviors and prevents unsafe or hallucinated outputs from becoming deeply embedded. To tackle this issue, we introduce a new pretraining method that streams documents and uses reinforcement learning (RL) to improve the next K generated tokens at each step. A strong, post-trained model judges candidate generations -- including model rollouts, the original suffix, and a rewritten suffix -- for quality, safety, and factuality. Early in training, the process relies on the original and rewritten suffixes; as the model improves, RL rewards high-quality rollouts. This approach builds higher quality, safer, and more factual models from the ground up. In experiments, our method gives 36.2% and 18.5% relative improvements over standard pretraining in terms of factuality and safety, and up to 86.3% win rate improvements in overall generation quality.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21343v1,,False
Modeling Endogenous Logic: Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation,29/01/2026,"Yuzhe Chen, Jie Cao, Youquan Wang, Haicheng Tao, Darko B. Vukovic, Jia Wu","Existing multi-behavior recommendations tend to prioritize performance at the expense of explainability, while current explainable methods suffer from limited generalizability due to their reliance on external information. Neuro-Symbolic integration offers a promising avenue for explainability by combining neural networks with symbolic logic rule reasoning. Concurrently, we posit that user behavior chains inherently embody an endogenous logic suitable for explicit reasoning. However, these observational multiple behaviors are plagued by confounders, causing models to learn spurious correlations. By incorporating causal inference into this Neuro-Symbolic framework, we propose a novel Causal Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning model for Explainable Multi-Behavior Recommendation (CNRE). CNRE operationalizes the endogenous logic by simulating a human-like decision-making process. Specifically, CNRE first employs hierarchical preference propagation to capture heterogeneous cross-behavior dependencies. Subsequently, it models the endogenous logic rule implicit in the user's behavior chain based on preference strength, and adaptively dispatches to the corresponding neural-logic reasoning path (e.g., conjunction, disjunction). This process generates an explainable causal mediator that approximates an ideal state isolated from confounding effects. Extensive experiments on three large-scale datasets demonstrate CNRE's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines, offering multi-level explainability from model design and decision process to recommendation results.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21335v1,,False
Few-Shot Learning for Dynamic Operations of Automated Electric Taxi Fleets under Evolving Charging Infrastructure: A Meta-Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,29/01/2026,"Xiaozhuang Li, Xindi Tang, Fang He","With the rapid expansion of electric vehicles (EVs) and charging infrastructure, the effective management of Autonomous Electric Taxi (AET) fleets faces a critical challenge in environments with dynamic and uncertain charging availability.

To bridge this gap, we propose GAT-PEARL, a novel meta-reinforcement learning framework that learns an adaptive operational policy. Our approach integrates a graph attention network (GAT) to effectively extract robust spatial representations under infrastructure layouts and model the complex spatiotemporal relationships of the urban environment, and employs probabilistic embeddings for actor-critic reinforcement learning (PEARL) to enable rapid, inference-based adaptation to changes in charging network layouts without retraining.

TimeSliver : Symbolic-Linear Decomposition for Explainable Time Series Classification,29/01/2026,"Akash Pandey, Payal Mohapatra, Wei Chen, Qi Zhu, Sinan Keten","Identifying the extent to which every temporal segment influences a model's predictions is essential for explaining model decisions and increasing transparency. While post-hoc explainable methods based on gradients and feature-based attributions have been popular, they suffer from reference state sensitivity and struggle to generalize across time-series datasets, as they treat time points independently and ignore sequential dependencies. Another perspective on explainable time-series classification is through interpretable components of the model, for instance, leveraging self-attention mechanisms to estimate temporal attribution; however, recent findings indicate that these attention weights often fail to provide faithful measures of temporal importance. In this work, we advance this perspective and present a novel explainability-driven deep learning framework, TimeSliver, which jointly utilizes raw time-series data and its symbolic abstraction to construct a representation that maintains the original temporal structure. Each element in this representation linearly encodes the contribution of each temporal segment to the final prediction, allowing us to assign a meaningful importance score to every time point. For time-series classification, TimeSliver outperforms other temporal attribution methods by 11% on 7 distinct synthetic and real-world multivariate time-series datasets.

Conditional Generative Framework with Peak-Aware Attention for Robust Chemical Detection under Interferences,29/01/2026,"Namkyung Yoon, Sanghong Kim, Hwangnam Kim","Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a widely used analytical method for chemical substance detection, but measurement reliability tends to deteriorate in the presence of interfering substances. In particular, interfering substances cause nonspecific peaks, residence time shifts, and increased background noise, resulting in reduced sensitivity and false alarms. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence discrimination framework based on a peak-aware conditional generative model to improve the reliability of GC-MS measurements under interference conditions. The framework is learned with a novel peak-aware mechanism that highlights the characteristic peaks of GC-MS data, allowing it to generate important spectral features more faithfully. In addition, chemical and solvent information is encoded in a latent vector embedded with it, allowing a conditional generative adversarial neural network (CGAN) to generate a synthetic GC-MS signal consistent with the experimental conditions. This generates an experimental dataset that assumes indirect substance situations in chemical substance data, where acquisition is limited without conducting real experiments. These data are used for the learning of AI-based GC-MS discrimination models to help in accurate chemical substance discrimination. We conduct various quantitative and qualitative evaluations of the generated simulated data to verify the validity of the proposed framework. We also verify how the generative model improves the performance of the AI discrimination framework. Representatively, the proposed method is shown to consistently achieve cosine similarity and Pearson correlation coefficient values above 0.9 while preserving peak number diversity and reducing false alarms in the discrimination model.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.21246v1,,False
Temporal Context and Architecture: A Benchmark for Naturalistic EEG Decoding,29/01/2026,Mehmet Ergezer,"We study how model architecture and temporal context interact in naturalistic EEG decoding.

Accuracy improves with longer context: at 64s, S5 reaches 98.7%+/-0.6 and CNN 98.3%+/-0.3, while S5 uses ~20x fewer parameters than CNN. To probe real-world robustness, we evaluate zero-shot cross-frequency shifts, cross-task OOD inputs, and leave-one-subject-out generalization. S5 achieves stronger cross-subject accuracy but makes over-confident errors on OOD tasks; EEGXF is more conservative and stable under frequency shifts, though less calibrated in-distribution.
