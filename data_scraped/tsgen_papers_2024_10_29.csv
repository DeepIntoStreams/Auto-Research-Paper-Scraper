Adaptive Transfer Clustering: A Unified Framework,28/10/2024,"Yuqi Gu, Zhongyuan Lyu, Kaizheng Wang","We propose a general transfer learning framework for clustering given a main
dataset and an auxiliary one about the same subjects. The two datasets may
reflect similar but different latent grouping structures of the subjects. We
propose an adaptive transfer clustering (ATC) algorithm that automatically
leverages the commonality in the presence of unknown discrepancy, by optimizing
an estimated bias-variance decomposition. It applies to a broad class of
statistical models including Gaussian mixture models, stochastic block models,
and latent class models. A theoretical analysis proves the optimality of ATC
under the Gaussian mixture model and explicitly quantifies the benefit of
transfer. Extensive simulations and real data experiments confirm our method's
effectiveness in various scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21263v1,,False
One-Step Diffusion Policy: Fast Visuomotor Policies via Diffusion Distillation,28/10/2024,"Zhendong Wang, Zhaoshuo Li, Ajay Mandlekar, Zhenjia Xu, Jiaojiao Fan, Yashraj Narang, Linxi Fan, Yuke Zhu, Yogesh Balaji, Mingyuan Zhou, Ming-Yu Liu, Yu Zeng","Diffusion models, praised for their success in generative tasks, are
increasingly being applied to robotics, demonstrating exceptional performance
in behavior cloning. However, their slow generation process stemming from
iterative denoising steps poses a challenge for real-time applications in
resource-constrained robotics setups and dynamically changing environments. In
this paper, we introduce the One-Step Diffusion Policy (OneDP), a novel
approach that distills knowledge from pre-trained diffusion policies into a
single-step action generator, significantly accelerating response times for
robotic control tasks. We ensure the distilled generator closely aligns with
the original policy distribution by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence along the diffusion chain, requiring only $2\%$-$10\%$ additional
pre-training cost for convergence. We evaluated OneDP on 6 challenging
simulation tasks as well as 4 self-designed real-world tasks using the Franka
robot. The results demonstrate that OneDP not only achieves state-of-the-art
success rates but also delivers an order-of-magnitude improvement in inference
speed, boosting action prediction frequency from 1.5 Hz to 62 Hz, establishing
its potential for dynamic and computationally constrained robotic applications.

SeriesGAN: Time Series Generation via Adversarial and Autoregressive Learning,28/10/2024,"MohammadReza EskandariNasab, Shah Muhammad Hamdi, Soukaina Filali Boubrahimi","Current Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approaches for time series
generation face challenges such as suboptimal convergence, information loss in
embedding spaces, and instability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce
an advanced framework that integrates the advantages of an
autoencoder-generated embedding space with the adversarial training dynamics of
GANs. This method employs two discriminators: one to specifically guide the
generator and another to refine both the autoencoder's and generator's output.
Additionally, our framework incorporates a novel autoencoder-based loss
function and supervision from a teacher-forcing supervisor network, which
captures the stepwise conditional distributions of the data. The generator
operates within the latent space, while the two discriminators work on latent
and feature spaces separately, providing crucial feedback to both the generator
and the autoencoder. By leveraging this dual-discriminator approach, we
minimize information loss in the embedding space. Through joint training, our
framework excels at generating high-fidelity time series data, consistently
outperforming existing state-of-the-art benchmarks both qualitatively and
quantitatively across a range of real and synthetic multivariate time series
datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21203v1,,False
Trajectory Flow Matching with Applications to Clinical Time Series Modeling,28/10/2024,"Xi Zhang, Yuan Pu, Yuki Kawamura, Andrew Loza, Yoshua Bengio, Dennis L. Shung, Alexander Tong","Modeling stochastic and irregularly sampled time series is a challenging
problem found in a wide range of applications, especially in medicine. Neural
stochastic differential equations (Neural SDEs) are an attractive modeling
technique for this problem, which parameterize the drift and diffusion terms of
an SDE with neural networks. However, current algorithms for training Neural
SDEs require backpropagation through the SDE dynamics, greatly limiting their
scalability and stability. To address this, we propose Trajectory Flow Matching
(TFM), which trains a Neural SDE in a simulation-free manner, bypassing
backpropagation through the dynamics. TFM leverages the flow matching technique
from generative modeling to model time series. In this work we first establish
necessary conditions for TFM to learn time series data. Next, we present a
reparameterization trick which improves training stability. Finally, we adapt
TFM to the clinical time series setting, demonstrating improved performance on
three clinical time series datasets both in terms of absolute performance and
uncertainty prediction.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21154v1,,False
Palisade -- Prompt Injection Detection Framework,28/10/2024,"Sahasra Kokkula, Somanathan R, Nandavardhan R, Aashishkumar, G Divya","The advent of Large Language Models LLMs marks a milestone in Artificial
Intelligence, altering how machines comprehend and generate human language.
However, LLMs are vulnerable to malicious prompt injection attacks, where
crafted inputs manipulate the models behavior in unintended ways, compromising
system integrity and causing incorrect outcomes. Conventional detection methods
rely on static, rule-based approaches, which often fail against sophisticated
threats like abnormal token sequences and alias substitutions, leading to
limited adaptability and higher rates of false positives and false
negatives.This paper proposes a novel NLP based approach for prompt injection
detection, emphasizing accuracy and optimization through a layered input
screening process. In this framework, prompts are filtered through three
distinct layers rule-based, ML classifier, and companion LLM before reaching
the target model, thereby minimizing the risk of malicious interaction.Tests
show the ML classifier achieves the highest accuracy among individual layers,
yet the multi-layer framework enhances overall detection accuracy by reducing
false negatives. Although this increases false positives, it minimizes the risk
of overlooking genuine injected prompts, thus prioritizing security.This
multi-layered detection approach highlights LLM vulnerabilities and provides a
comprehensive framework for future research, promoting secure interactions
between humans and AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21146v1,,False
Federated Time Series Generation on Feature and Temporally Misaligned Data,28/10/2024,"Chenrui Fan, Zhi Wen Soi, Aditya Shankar, Abele Mălan, Lydia Y. Chen","Distributed time series data presents a challenge for federated learning, as
clients often possess different feature sets and have misaligned time steps.
Existing federated time series models are limited by the assumption of perfect
temporal or feature alignment across clients. In this paper, we propose FedTDD,
a novel federated time series diffusion model that jointly learns a synthesizer
across clients. At the core of FedTDD is a novel data distillation and
aggregation framework that reconciles the differences between clients by
imputing the misaligned timesteps and features. In contrast to traditional
federated learning, FedTDD learns the correlation across clients' time series
through the exchange of local synthetic outputs instead of model parameters. A
coordinator iteratively improves a global distiller network by leveraging
shared knowledge from clients through the exchange of synthetic data. As the
distiller becomes more refined over time, it subsequently enhances the quality
of the clients' local feature estimates, allowing each client to then improve
its local imputations for missing data using the latest, more accurate
distiller. Experimental results on five datasets demonstrate FedTDD's
effectiveness compared to centralized training, and the effectiveness of
sharing synthetic outputs to transfer knowledge of local time series. Notably,
FedTDD achieves 79.4% and 62.8% improvement over local training in Context-FID
and Correlational scores.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21072v1,,False
Physics-informed Partitioned Coupled Neural Operator for Complex Networks,28/10/2024,"Weidong Wu, Yong Zhang, Lili Hao, Yang Chen, Xiaoyan Sun, Dunwei Gong","Physics-Informed Neural Operators provide efficient, high-fidelity
simulations for systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, most existing studies focus only on multi-scale, multi-physics systems
within a single spatial region, neglecting the case with multiple
interconnected sub-regions, such as gas and thermal systems. To address this,
this paper proposes a Physics-Informed Partitioned Coupled Neural Operator
(PCNO) to enhance the simulation performance of such networks. Compared to the
existing Fourier Neural Operator (FNO), this method designs a joint convolution
operator within the Fourier layer, enabling global integration capturing all
sub-regions. Additionally, grid alignment layers are introduced outside the
Fourier layer to help the joint convolution operator accurately learn the
coupling relationship between sub-regions in the frequency domain. Experiments
on gas networks demonstrate that the proposed operator not only accurately
simulates complex systems but also shows good generalization and low model
complexity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21025v1,,False
A Stein Gradient Descent Approach for Doubly Intractable Distributions,28/10/2024,"Heesang Lee, Songhee Kim, Bokgyeong Kang, Jaewoo Park","Bayesian inference for doubly intractable distributions is challenging
because they include intractable terms, which are functions of parameters of
interest. Although several alternatives have been developed for such models,
they are computationally intensive due to repeated auxiliary variable
simulations. We propose a novel Monte Carlo Stein variational gradient descent
(MC-SVGD) approach for inference for doubly intractable distributions. Through
an efficient gradient approximation, our MC-SVGD approach rapidly transforms an
arbitrary reference distribution to approximate the posterior distribution of
interest, without necessitating any predefined variational distribution class
for the posterior. Such a transport map is obtained by minimizing
Kullback-Leibler divergence between the transformed and posterior distributions
in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). We also investigate the
convergence rate of the proposed method. We illustrate the application of the
method to challenging examples, including a Potts model, an exponential random
graph model, and a Conway--Maxwell--Poisson regression model. The proposed
method achieves substantial computational gains over existing algorithms, while
providing comparable inferential performance for the posterior distributions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21021v1,,False
Informed Deep Abstaining Classifier: Investigating noise-robust training for diagnostic decision support systems,28/10/2024,"Helen Schneider, Sebastian Nowak, Aditya Parikh, Yannik C. Layer, Maike Theis, Wolfgang Block, Alois M. Sprinkart, Ulrike Attenberger, Rafet Sifa","Image-based diagnostic decision support systems (DDSS) utilizing deep
learning have the potential to optimize clinical workflows. However, developing
DDSS requires extensive datasets with expert annotations and is therefore
costly. Leveraging report contents from radiological data bases with Natural
Language Processing to annotate the corresponding image data promises to
replace labor-intensive manual annotation. As mining ""real world"" databases can
introduce label noise, noise-robust training losses are of great interest.
However, current noise-robust losses do not consider noise estimations that can
for example be derived based on the performance of the automatic label
generator used. In this study, we expand the noise-robust Deep Abstaining
Classifier (DAC) loss to an Informed Deep Abstaining Classifier (IDAC) loss by
incorporating noise level estimations during training. Our findings demonstrate
that IDAC enhances the noise robustness compared to DAC and several
state-of-the-art loss functions. The results are obtained on various simulated
noise levels using a public chest X-ray data set. These findings are reproduced
on an in-house noisy data set, where labels were extracted from the clinical
systems of the University Hospital Bonn by a text-based transformer. The IDAC
can therefore be a valuable tool for researchers, companies or clinics aiming
to develop accurate and reliable DDSS from routine clinical data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.21014v1,,False
Neural Hamilton: Can A.I. Understand Hamiltonian Mechanics?,28/10/2024,"Tae-Geun Kim, Seong Chan Park","We propose a novel framework based on neural network that reformulates
classical mechanics as an operator learning problem. A machine directly maps a
potential function to its corresponding trajectory in phase space without
solving the Hamilton equations. Most notably, while conventional methods tend
to accumulate errors over time through iterative time integration, our approach
prevents error propagation. Two newly developed neural network architectures,
namely VaRONet and MambONet, are introduced to adapt the Variational LSTM
sequence-to-sequence model and leverage the Mamba model for efficient temporal
dynamics processing. We tested our approach with various 1D physics problems:
harmonic oscillation, double-well potentials, Morse potential, and other
potential models outside the training data. Compared to traditional numerical
methods based on the fourth-order Runge-Kutta (RK4) algorithm, our model
demonstrates improved computational efficiency and accuracy.

FACTS: A Factored State-Space Framework For World Modelling,28/10/2024,"Li Nanbo, Firas Laakom, Yucheng Xu, Wenyi Wang, Jürgen Schmidhuber","World modelling is essential for understanding and predicting the dynamics of
complex systems by learning both spatial and temporal dependencies. However,
current frameworks, such as Transformers and selective state-space models like
Mambas, exhibit limitations in efficiently encoding spatial and temporal
structures, particularly in scenarios requiring long-term high-dimensional
sequence modelling. To address these issues, we propose a novel recurrent
framework, the \textbf{FACT}ored \textbf{S}tate-space (\textbf{FACTS}) model,
for spatial-temporal world modelling. The FACTS framework constructs a
graph-structured memory with a routing mechanism that learns permutable memory
representations, ensuring invariance to input permutations while adapting
through selective state-space propagation. Furthermore, FACTS supports parallel
computation of high-dimensional sequences. We empirically evaluate FACTS across
diverse tasks, including multivariate time series forecasting and
object-centric world modelling, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms
or matches specialised state-of-the-art models, despite its general-purpose
world modelling design.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20922v1,,False
Deep Recurrent Stochastic Configuration Networks for Modelling Nonlinear Dynamic Systems,28/10/2024,"Gang Dang, Dianhui Wang","Deep learning techniques have shown promise in many domain applications. This
paper proposes a novel deep reservoir computing framework, termed deep
recurrent stochastic configuration network (DeepRSCN) for modelling nonlinear
dynamic systems. DeepRSCNs are incrementally constructed, with all reservoir
nodes directly linked to the final output. The random parameters are assigned
in the light of a supervisory mechanism, ensuring the universal approximation
property of the built model. The output weights are updated online using the
projection algorithm to handle the unknown dynamics. Given a set of training
samples, DeepRSCNs can quickly generate learning representations, which consist
of random basis functions with cascaded input and readout weights. Experimental
results over a time series prediction, a nonlinear system identification
problem, and two industrial data predictive analyses demonstrate that the
proposed DeepRSCN outperforms the single-layer network in terms of modelling
efficiency, learning capability, and generalization performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20904v1,,False
Active Causal Structure Learning with Latent Variables: Towards Learning to Detour in Autonomous Robots,28/10/2024,"Pablo de los Riscos, Fernando Corbacho","Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) Agents and Robots must be able to cope
with everchanging environments and tasks. They must be able to actively
construct new internal causal models of their interactions with the environment
when new structural changes take place in the environment. Thus, we claim that
active causal structure learning with latent variables (ACSLWL) is a necessary
component to build AGI agents and robots. This paper describes how a complex
planning and expectation-based detour behavior can be learned by ACSLWL when,
unexpectedly, and for the first time, the simulated robot encounters a sort of
transparent barrier in its pathway towards its target. ACSWL consists of acting
in the environment, discovering new causal relations, constructing new causal
models, exploiting the causal models to maximize its expected utility,
detecting possible latent variables when unexpected observations occur, and
constructing new structures-internal causal models and optimal estimation of
the associated parameters, to be able to cope efficiently with the new
encountered situations. That is, the agent must be able to construct new causal
internal models that transform a previously unexpected and inefficient
(sub-optimal) situation, into a predictable situation with an optimal operating
plan.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20894v1,,False
Generative Simulations of The Solar Corona Evolution With Denoising Diffusion : Proof of Concept,28/10/2024,"Grégoire Francisco, Francesco Pio Ramunno, Manolis K. Georgoulis, João Fernandes, Teresa Barata, Dario Del Moro","The solar magnetized corona is responsible for various manifestations with a
space weather impact, such as flares, coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and,
naturally, the solar wind. Modeling the corona's dynamics and evolution is
therefore critical for improving our ability to predict space weather In this
work, we demonstrate that generative deep learning methods, such as Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM), can be successfully applied to simulate
future evolutions of the corona as observed in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV)
wavelengths. Our model takes a 12-hour video of an Active Region (AR) as input
and simulate the potential evolution of the AR over the subsequent 12 hours,
with a time-resolution of two hours. We propose a light UNet backbone
architecture adapted to our problem by adding 1D temporal convolutions after
each classical 2D spatial ones, and spatio-temporal attention in the bottleneck
part. The model not only produce visually realistic outputs but also captures
the inherent stochasticity of the system's evolution. Notably, the simulations
enable the generation of reliable confidence intervals for key predictive
metrics such as the EUV peak flux and fluence of the ARs, paving the way for
probabilistic and interpretable space weather forecasting. Future studies will
focus on shorter forecasting horizons with increased spatial and temporal
resolution, aiming at reducing the uncertainty of the simulations and providing
practical applications for space weather forecasting. The code used for this

Introducing Spectral Attention for Long-Range Dependency in Time Series Forecasting,28/10/2024,"Bong Gyun Kang, Dongjun Lee, HyunGi Kim, DoHyun Chung","Sequence modeling faces challenges in capturing long-range dependencies
across diverse tasks. Recent linear and transformer-based forecasters have
shown superior performance in time series forecasting. However, they are
constrained by their inherent inability to effectively address long-range
dependencies in time series data, primarily due to using fixed-size inputs for
prediction. Furthermore, they typically sacrifice essential temporal
correlation among consecutive training samples by shuffling them into
mini-batches. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a fast and effective
Spectral Attention mechanism, which preserves temporal correlations among
samples and facilitates the handling of long-range information while
maintaining the base model structure. Spectral Attention preserves long-period
trends through a low-pass filter and facilitates gradient to flow between
samples. Spectral Attention can be seamlessly integrated into most sequence
models, allowing models with fixed-sized look-back windows to capture
long-range dependencies over thousands of steps. Through extensive experiments
on 11 real-world time series datasets using 7 recent forecasting models, we
consistently demonstrate the efficacy of our Spectral Attention mechanism,
achieving state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20772v1,,False
A Static and Dynamic Attention Framework for Multi Turn Dialogue Generation,28/10/2024,"Wei-Nan Zhang, Yiming Cui, Kaiyan Zhang, Yifa Wang, Qingfu Zhu, Lingzhi Li, Ting Liu","Recently, research on open domain dialogue systems have attracted extensive
interests of academic and industrial researchers. The goal of an open domain
dialogue system is to imitate humans in conversations. Previous works on single
turn conversation generation have greatly promoted the research of open domain
dialogue systems. However, understanding multiple single turn conversations is
not equal to the understanding of multi turn dialogue due to the coherent and
context dependent properties of human dialogue. Therefore, in open domain multi
turn dialogue generation, it is essential to modeling the contextual semantics
of the dialogue history, rather than only according to the last utterance.
Previous research had verified the effectiveness of the hierarchical recurrent
encoder-decoder framework on open domain multi turn dialogue generation.
However, using RNN-based model to hierarchically encoding the utterances to
obtain the representation of dialogue history still face the problem of a
vanishing gradient. To address this issue, in this paper, we proposed a static
and dynamic attention-based approach to model the dialogue history and then
generate open domain multi turn dialogue responses. Experimental results on
Ubuntu and Opensubtitles datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed
static and dynamic attention-based approach on automatic and human evaluation
metrics in various experimental settings. Meanwhile, we also empirically verify
the performance of combining the static and dynamic attentions on open domain
multi turn dialogue generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20766v1,10.1145/3522763,False
Likelihood approximations via Gaussian approximate inference,28/10/2024,Thang D. Bui,"Non-Gaussian likelihoods are essential for modelling complex real-world
observations but pose significant computational challenges in learning and
inference. Even with Gaussian priors, non-Gaussian likelihoods often lead to
analytically intractable posteriors, necessitating approximation methods. To
this end, we propose efficient schemes to approximate the effects of
non-Gaussian likelihoods by Gaussian densities based on variational inference
and moment matching in transformed bases. These enable efficient inference
strategies originally designed for models with a Gaussian likelihood to be
deployed. Our empirical results demonstrate that the proposed matching
strategies attain good approximation quality for binary and multiclass
classification in large-scale point-estimate and distributional inferential
settings. In challenging streaming problems, the proposed methods outperform
all existing likelihood approximations and approximate inference methods in the
exact models. As a by-product, we show that the proposed approximate
log-likelihoods are a superior alternative to least-squares on raw labels for
neural network classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.20754v1,,False
