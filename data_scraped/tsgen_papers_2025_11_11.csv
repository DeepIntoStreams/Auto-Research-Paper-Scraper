SpatialThinker: Reinforcing 3D Reasoning in Multimodal LLMs via Spatial Rewards,10/11/2025,"Hunar Batra, Haoqin Tu, Hardy Chen, Yuanze Lin, Cihang Xie, Ronald Clark","Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
vision-language tasks, but they continue to struggle with spatial
understanding. Existing spatial MLLMs often rely on explicit 3D inputs or
architecture-specific modifications, and remain constrained by large-scale
datasets or sparse supervision. To address these limitations, we introduce
SpatialThinker, a 3D-aware MLLM trained with RL to integrate structured spatial
grounding with multi-step reasoning. The model simulates human-like spatial
perception by constructing a scene graph of task-relevant objects and spatial
relations, and reasoning towards an answer via dense spatial rewards.
SpatialThinker consists of two key contributions: (1) a data synthesis pipeline
that generates STVQA-7K, a high-quality spatial VQA dataset, and (2) online RL
with a multi-objective dense spatial reward enforcing spatial grounding.
SpatialThinker-7B outperforms supervised fine-tuning and the sparse RL baseline
on spatial understanding and real-world VQA benchmarks, nearly doubling the
base-model gain compared to sparse RL, and surpassing GPT-4o. These results
showcase the effectiveness of combining spatial supervision with reward-aligned
reasoning in enabling robust 3D spatial understanding with limited data and
advancing MLLMs towards human-level visual reasoning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07403v1,,False
StreamDiffusionV2: A Streaming System for Dynamic and Interactive Video Generation,10/11/2025,"Tianrui Feng, Zhi Li, Shuo Yang, Haocheng Xi, Muyang Li, Xiuyu Li, Lvmin Zhang, Keting Yang, Kelly Peng, Song Han, Maneesh Agrawala, Kurt Keutzer, Akio Kodaira, Chenfeng Xu","Generative models are reshaping the live-streaming industry by redefining how
content is created, styled, and delivered. Previous image-based streaming
diffusion models have powered efficient and creative live streaming products
but have hit limits on temporal consistency due to the foundation of
image-based designs. Recent advances in video diffusion have markedly improved
temporal consistency and sampling efficiency for offline generation. However,
offline generation systems primarily optimize throughput by batching large
workloads. In contrast, live online streaming operates under strict
service-level objectives (SLOs): time-to-first-frame must be minimal, and every
frame must meet a per-frame deadline with low jitter. Besides, scalable
multi-GPU serving for real-time streams remains largely unresolved so far. To
address this, we present StreamDiffusionV2, a training-free pipeline for
interactive live streaming with video diffusion models. StreamDiffusionV2
integrates an SLO-aware batching scheduler and a block scheduler, together with
a sink-token--guided rolling KV cache, a motion-aware noise controller, and
other system-level optimizations. Moreover, we introduce a scalable pipeline
orchestration that parallelizes the diffusion process across denoising steps
and network layers, achieving near-linear FPS scaling without violating latency
guarantees. The system scales seamlessly across heterogeneous GPU environments
and supports flexible denoising steps (e.g., 1--4), enabling both
ultra-low-latency and higher-quality modes. Without TensorRT or quantization,
StreamDiffusionV2 renders the first frame within 0.5s and attains 58.28 FPS
with a 14B-parameter model and 64.52 FPS with a 1.3B-parameter model on four
H100 GPUs, making state-of-the-art generative live streaming practical and
accessible--from individual creators to enterprise-scale platforms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07399v1,,False
A Diffusion Model to Shrink Proteins While Maintaining Their Function,10/11/2025,"Ethan Baron, Alan N. Amin, Ruben Weitzman, Debora Marks, Andrew Gordon Wilson","Many proteins useful in modern medicine or bioengineering are challenging to
make in the lab, fuse with other proteins in cells, or deliver to tissues in
the body, because their sequences are too long. Shortening these sequences
typically involves costly, time-consuming experimental campaigns. Ideally, we
could instead use modern models of massive databases of sequences from nature
to learn how to propose shrunken proteins that resemble sequences found in
nature. Unfortunately, these models struggle to efficiently search the
combinatorial space of all deletions, and are not trained with inductive biases
to learn how to delete. To address this gap, we propose SCISOR, a novel
discrete diffusion model that deletes letters from sequences to generate
protein samples that resemble those found in nature. To do so, SCISOR trains a
de-noiser to reverse a forward noising process that adds random insertions to
natural sequences. As a generative model, SCISOR fits evolutionary sequence
data competitively with previous large models. In evaluation, SCISOR achieves
state-of-the-art predictions of the functional effects of deletions on
ProteinGym. Finally, we use the SCISOR de-noiser to shrink long protein
sequences, and show that its suggested deletions result in significantly more
realistic proteins and more often preserve functional motifs than previous
models of evolutionary sequences.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07390v1,,False
DeepPersona: A Generative Engine for Scaling Deep Synthetic Personas,10/11/2025,"Zhen Wang, Yufan Zhou, Zhongyan Luo, Lyumanshan Ye, Adam Wood, Man Yao, Luoshang Pan","Simulating human profiles by instilling personas into large language models
(LLMs) is rapidly transforming research in agentic behavioral simulation, LLM
personalization, and human-AI alignment. However, most existing synthetic
personas remain shallow and simplistic, capturing minimal attributes and
failing to reflect the rich complexity and diversity of real human identities.
We introduce DEEPPERSONA, a scalable generative engine for synthesizing
narrative-complete synthetic personas through a two-stage, taxonomy-guided
method. First, we algorithmically construct the largest-ever human-attribute
taxonomy, comprising over hundreds of hierarchically organized attributes, by
mining thousands of real user-ChatGPT conversations. Second, we progressively
sample attributes from this taxonomy, conditionally generating coherent and
realistic personas that average hundreds of structured attributes and roughly 1
MB of narrative text, two orders of magnitude deeper than prior works.
Intrinsic evaluations confirm significant improvements in attribute diversity
(32 percent higher coverage) and profile uniqueness (44 percent greater)
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Extrinsically, our personas enhance
GPT-4.1-mini's personalized question answering accuracy by 11.6 percent on
average across ten metrics and substantially narrow (by 31.7 percent) the gap
between simulated LLM citizens and authentic human responses in social surveys.
Our generated national citizens reduced the performance gap on the Big Five
personality test by 17 percent relative to LLM-simulated citizens. DEEPPERSONA
thus provides a rigorous, scalable, and privacy-free platform for high-fidelity
human simulation and personalized AI research.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07338v1,,False
Beyond Detection: Exploring Evidence-based Multi-Agent Debate for Misinformation Intervention and Persuasion,10/11/2025,"Chen Han, Yijia Ma, Jin Tan, Wenzhen Zheng, Xijin Tang","Multi-agent debate (MAD) frameworks have emerged as promising approaches for
misinformation detection by simulating adversarial reasoning. While prior work
has focused on detection accuracy, it overlooks the importance of helping users
understand the reasoning behind factual judgments and develop future
resilience. The debate transcripts generated during MAD offer a rich but
underutilized resource for transparent reasoning. In this study, we introduce
ED2D, an evidence-based MAD framework that extends previous approach by
incorporating factual evidence retrieval. More importantly, ED2D is designed
not only as a detection framework but also as a persuasive multi-agent system
aimed at correcting user beliefs and discouraging misinformation sharing. We
compare the persuasive effects of ED2D-generated debunking transcripts with
those authored by human experts. Results demonstrate that ED2D outperforms
existing baselines across three misinformation detection benchmarks. When ED2D
generates correct predictions, its debunking transcripts exhibit persuasive
effects comparable to those of human experts; However, when ED2D misclassifies,
its accompanying explanations may inadvertently reinforce users'misconceptions,
even when presented alongside accurate human explanations. Our findings
highlight both the promise and the potential risks of deploying MAD systems for
misinformation intervention. We further develop a public community website to
help users explore ED2D, fostering transparency, critical thinking, and
collaborative fact-checking.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07267v1,,False
Conditional Diffusion as Latent Constraints for Controllable Symbolic Music Generation,10/11/2025,"Matteo Pettenó, Alessandro Ilic Mezza, Alberto Bernardini","Recent advances in latent diffusion models have demonstrated state-of-the-art
performance in high-dimensional time-series data synthesis while providing
flexible control through conditioning and guidance. However, existing
methodologies primarily rely on musical context or natural language as the main
modality of interacting with the generative process, which may not be ideal for
expert users who seek precise fader-like control over specific musical
attributes. In this work, we explore the application of denoising diffusion
processes as plug-and-play latent constraints for unconditional symbolic music
generation models. We focus on a framework that leverages a library of small
conditional diffusion models operating as implicit probabilistic priors on the
latents of a frozen unconditional backbone. While previous studies have
explored domain-specific use cases, this work, to the best of our knowledge, is
the first to demonstrate the versatility of such an approach across a diverse
array of musical attributes, such as note density, pitch range, contour, and
rhythm complexity. Our experiments show that diffusion-driven constraints
outperform traditional attribute regularization and other latent constraints
architectures, achieving significantly stronger correlations between target and
generated attributes while maintaining high perceptual quality and diversity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07156v1,,False
Dynamics-Decoupled Trajectory Alignment for Sim-to-Real Transfer in Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Driving,10/11/2025,"Thomas Steinecker, Alexander Bienemann, Denis Trescher, Thorsten Luettel, Mirko Maehlisch","Reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in robotics, but deploying RL
on real vehicles remains challenging due to the complexity of vehicle dynamics
and the mismatch between simulation and reality. Factors such as tire
characteristics, road surface conditions, aerodynamic disturbances, and vehicle
load make it infeasible to model real-world dynamics accurately, which hinders
direct transfer of RL agents trained in simulation. In this paper, we present a
framework that decouples motion planning from vehicle control through a spatial
and temporal alignment strategy between a virtual vehicle and the real system.
An RL agent is first trained in simulation using a kinematic bicycle model to
output continuous control actions. Its behavior is then distilled into a
trajectory-predicting agent that generates finite-horizon ego-vehicle
trajectories, enabling synchronization between virtual and real vehicles. At
deployment, a Stanley controller governs lateral dynamics, while longitudinal
alignment is maintained through adaptive update mechanisms that compensate for
deviations between virtual and real trajectories. We validate our approach on a
real vehicle and demonstrate that the proposed alignment strategy enables
robust zero-shot transfer of RL-based motion planning from simulation to
reality, successfully decoupling high-level trajectory generation from
low-level vehicle control.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07155v1,,False
A Theoretical Analysis of Detecting Large Model-Generated Time Series,10/11/2025,"Junji Hou, Junzhou Zhao, Shuo Zhang, Pinghui Wang","Motivated by the increasing risks of data misuse and fabrication, we
investigate the problem of identifying synthetic time series generated by
Time-Series Large Models (TSLMs) in this work. While there are extensive
researches on detecting model generated text, we find that these existing
methods are not applicable to time series data due to the fundamental modality
difference, as time series usually have lower information density and smoother
probability distributions than text data, which limit the discriminative power
of token-based detectors. To address this issue, we examine the subtle
distributional differences between real and model-generated time series and
propose the contraction hypothesis, which states that model-generated time
series, unlike real ones, exhibit progressively decreasing uncertainty under
recursive forecasting. We formally prove this hypothesis under theoretical
assumptions on model behavior and time series structure. Model-generated time
series exhibit progressively concentrated distributions under recursive
forecasting, leading to uncertainty contraction. We provide empirical
validation of the hypothesis across diverse datasets. Building on this insight,
we introduce the Uncertainty Contraction Estimator (UCE), a white-box detector
that aggregates uncertainty metrics over successive prefixes to identify
TSLM-generated time series. Extensive experiments on 32 datasets show that UCE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a reliable and
generalizable solution for detecting model-generated time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07104v1,,False
"Do LLMs Feel? Teaching Emotion Recognition with Prompts, Retrieval, and Curriculum Learning",10/11/2025,"Xinran Li, Xiujuan Xu, Jiaqi Qiao, Yu Liu","Emotion Recognition in Conversation (ERC) is a crucial task for understanding
human emotions and enabling natural human-computer interaction. Although Large
Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown great potential in this field, their
ability to capture the intrinsic connections between explicit and implicit
emotions remains limited. We propose a novel ERC training framework, PRC-Emo,
which integrates Prompt engineering, demonstration Retrieval, and Curriculum
learning, with the goal of exploring whether LLMs can effectively perceive
emotions in conversational contexts. Specifically, we design emotion-sensitive
prompt templates based on both explicit and implicit emotional cues to better
guide the model in understanding the speaker's psychological states. We
construct the first dedicated demonstration retrieval repository for ERC, which
includes training samples from widely used datasets, as well as high-quality
dialogue examples generated by LLMs and manually verified. Moreover, we
introduce a curriculum learning strategy into the LoRA fine-tuning process,
incorporating weighted emotional shifts between same-speaker and
different-speaker utterances to assign difficulty levels to dialogue samples,
which are then organized in an easy-to-hard training sequence. Experimental
results on two benchmark datasets-- IEMOCAP and MELD --show that our method
achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, demonstrating the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in improving LLM-based
emotional understanding.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.07061v1,,False
Counterfactual Explanation for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Exogenous Variables,10/11/2025,Keita Kinjo,"Currently, machine learning is widely used across various domains, including
time series data analysis. However, some machine learning models function as
black boxes, making interpretability a critical concern. One approach to
address this issue is counterfactual explanation (CE), which aims to provide
insights into model predictions. This study focuses on the relatively
underexplored problem of generating counterfactual explanations for time series
forecasting. We propose a method for extracting CEs in time series forecasting
using exogenous variables, which are frequently encountered in fields such as
business and marketing. In addition, we present methods for analyzing the
influence of each variable over an entire time series, generating CEs by
altering only specific variables, and evaluating the quality of the resulting
CEs. We validate the proposed method through theoretical analysis and empirical
experiments, showcasing its accuracy and practical applicability. These
contributions are expected to support real-world decision-making based on time
series data analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06906v1,,False
Beyond Observations: Reconstruction Error-Guided Irregularly Sampled Time Series Representation Learning,10/11/2025,"Jiexi Liu, Meng Cao, Songcan Chen","Irregularly sampled time series (ISTS), characterized by non-uniform time
intervals with natural missingness, are prevalent in real-world applications.
Existing approaches for ISTS modeling primarily rely on observed values to
impute unobserved ones or infer latent dynamics. However, these methods
overlook a critical source of learning signal: the reconstruction error
inherently produced during model training. Such error implicitly reflects how
well a model captures the underlying data structure and can serve as an
informative proxy for unobserved values. To exploit this insight, we propose
iTimER, a simple yet effective self-supervised pre-training framework for ISTS
representation learning. iTimER models the distribution of reconstruction
errors over observed values and generates pseudo-observations for unobserved
timestamps through a mixup strategy between sampled errors and the last
available observations. This transforms unobserved timestamps into noise-aware
training targets, enabling meaningful reconstruction signals. A Wasserstein
metric aligns reconstruction error distributions between observed and
pseudo-observed regions, while a contrastive learning objective enhances the
discriminability of learned representations. Extensive experiments on
classification, interpolation, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that iTimER
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods under the ISTS setting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06854v1,,False
AgentSUMO: An Agentic Framework for Interactive Simulation Scenario Generation in SUMO via Large Language Models,10/11/2025,"Minwoo Jeong, Jeeyun Chang, Yoonjin Yoon","The growing complexity of urban mobility systems has made traffic simulation
indispensable for evidence-based transportation planning and policy evaluation.
However, despite the analytical capabilities of platforms such as the
Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO), their application remains largely confined
to domain experts. Developing realistic simulation scenarios requires expertise
in network construction, origin-destination modeling, and parameter
configuration for policy experimentation, creating substantial barriers for
non-expert users such as policymakers, urban planners, and city officials.
Moreover, the requests expressed by these users are often incomplete and
abstract-typically articulated as high-level objectives, which are not well
aligned with the imperative, sequential workflows employed in existing
language-model-based simulation frameworks. To address these challenges, this
study proposes AgentSUMO, an agentic framework for interactive simulation
scenario generation via large language models. AgentSUMO departs from
imperative, command-driven execution by introducing an adaptive reasoning layer
that interprets user intents, assesses task complexity, infers missing
parameters, and formulates executable simulation plans. The framework is
structured around two complementary components, the Interactive Planning
Protocol, which governs reasoning and user interaction, and the Model Context
Protocol, which manages standardized communication and orchestration among
simulation tools. Through this design, AgentSUMO converts abstract policy
objectives into executable simulation scenarios. Experiments on urban networks
in Seoul and Manhattan demonstrate that the agentic workflow achieves
substantial improvements in traffic flow metrics while maintaining
accessibility for non-expert users, successfully bridging the gap between
policy goals and executable simulation workflows.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06804v1,,False
On the Mechanisms of Collaborative Learning in VAE Recommenders,10/11/2025,"Tung-Long Vuong, Julien Monteil, Hien Dang, Volodymyr Vaskovych, Trung Le, Vu Nguyen","Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) are a powerful alternative to matrix
factorization for recommendation. A common technique in VAE-based collaborative
filtering (CF) consists in applying binary input masking to user interaction
vectors, which improves performance but remains underexplored theoretically. In
this work, we analyze how collaboration arises in VAE-based CF and show it is
governed by latent proximity: we derive a latent sharing radius that informs
when an SGD update on one user strictly reduces the loss on another user, with
influence decaying as the latent Wasserstein distance increases. We further
study the induced geometry: with clean inputs, VAE-based CF primarily exploits
\emph{local} collaboration between input-similar users and under-utilizes
global collaboration between far-but-related users. We compare two mechanisms
that encourage \emph{global} mixing and characterize their trade-offs: (1)
$\beta$-KL regularization directly tightens the information bottleneck,
promoting posterior overlap but risking representational collapse if too large;
(2) input masking induces stochastic geometric contractions and expansions,
which can bring distant users onto the same latent neighborhood but also
introduce neighborhood drift. To preserve user identity while enabling global
consistency, we propose an anchor regularizer that aligns user posteriors with
item embeddings, stabilizing users under masking and facilitating signal
sharing across related items. Our analyses are validated on the Netflix,
MovieLens-20M, and Million Song datasets. We also successfully deployed our
proposed algorithm on an Amazon streaming platform following a successful
online experiment.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06781v1,,False
Structural Enforcement of Statistical Rigor in AI-Driven Discovery: A Functional Architecture,10/11/2025,Karen Sargsyan,"Sequential statistical protocols require meticulous state management and
robust error handling -- challenges naturally suited to functional programming.
We present a functional architecture for structural enforcement of statistical
rigor in automated research systems (AI-Scientists). These LLM-driven systems
risk generating spurious discoveries through dynamic hypothesis testing. We
introduce the Research monad, a Haskell eDSL that enforces sequential
statistical protocols (e.g., Online FDR (false discovery rate) control) using a
monad transformer stack. To address risks in hybrid architectures where LLMs
generate imperative code, we employ Declarative Scaffolding -- generating rigid
harnesses that structurally constrain execution and prevent methodological
errors like data leakage. We validate this approach through large-scale
simulation (N=2000 hypotheses) and an end-to-end case study, demonstrating
essential defense-in-depth for automated science integrity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06701v1,,False
Rapidly Learning Soft Robot Control via Implicit Time-Stepping,10/11/2025,"Andrew Choi, Dezhong Tong","With the explosive growth of rigid-body simulators, policy learning in
simulation has become the de facto standard for most rigid morphologies. In
contrast, soft robotic simulation frameworks remain scarce and are seldom
adopted by the soft robotics community. This gap stems partly from the lack of
easy-to-use, general-purpose frameworks and partly from the high computational
cost of accurately simulating continuum mechanics, which often renders policy
learning infeasible. In this work, we demonstrate that rapid soft robot policy
learning is indeed achievable via implicit time-stepping. Our simulator of
choice, DisMech, is a general-purpose, fully implicit soft-body simulator
capable of handling both soft dynamics and frictional contact. We further
introduce delta natural curvature control, a method analogous to delta joint
position control in rigid manipulators, providing an intuitive and effective
means of enacting control for soft robot learning. To highlight the benefits of
implicit time-stepping and delta curvature control, we conduct extensive
comparisons across four diverse soft manipulator tasks against one of the most
widely used soft-body frameworks, Elastica. With implicit time-stepping,
parallel stepping of 500 environments achieves up to 6x faster speeds for
non-contact cases and up to 40x faster for contact-rich scenarios. Finally, a
comprehensive sim-to-sim gap evaluation--training policies in one simulator and
evaluating them in another--demonstrates that implicit time-stepping provides a
rare free lunch: dramatic speedups achieved without sacrificing accuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06667v1,,False
CaberNet: Causal Representation Learning for Cross-Domain HVAC Energy Prediction,10/11/2025,"Kaiyuan Zhai, Jiacheng Cui, Zhehao Zhang, Junyu Xue, Yang Deng, Kui Wu, Guoming Tang","Cross-domain HVAC energy prediction is essential for scalable building energy
management, particularly because collecting extensive labeled data for every
new building is both costly and impractical. Yet, this task remains highly
challenging due to the scarcity and heterogeneity of data across different
buildings, climate zones, and seasonal patterns. In particular, buildings
situated in distinct climatic regions introduce variability that often leads
existing methods to overfit to spurious correlations, rely heavily on expert
intervention, or compromise on data diversity. To address these limitations, we
propose CaberNet, a causal and interpretable deep sequence model that learns
invariant (Markov blanket) representations for robust cross-domain prediction.
In a purely data-driven fashion and without requiring any prior knowledge,
CaberNet integrates i) a global feature gate trained with a self-supervised
Bernoulli regularization to distinguish superior causal features from inferior
ones, and ii) a domain-wise training scheme that balances domain contributions,
minimizes cross-domain loss variance, and promotes latent factor independence.
We evaluate CaberNet on real-world datasets collected from three buildings
located in three climatically diverse cities, and it consistently outperforms
all baselines, achieving a 22.9\% reduction in normalized mean squared error
(NMSE) compared to the best benchmark. Our code is available at

How Do VLAs Effectively Inherit from VLMs?,10/11/2025,"Chuheng Zhang, Rushuai Yang, Xiaoyu Chen, Kaixin Wang, Li Zhao, Yi Chen, Jiang Bian","Vision-language-action (VLA) models hold the promise to attain generalizable
embodied control. To achieve this, a pervasive paradigm is to leverage the rich
vision-semantic priors of large vision-language models (VLMs). However, the
fundamental question persists: How do VLAs effectively inherit the prior
knowledge from VLMs? To address this critical question, we introduce a
diagnostic benchmark, GrinningFace, an emoji tabletop manipulation task where
the robot arm is asked to place objects onto printed emojis corresponding to
language instructions. This task design is particularly revealing -- knowledge
associated with emojis is ubiquitous in Internet-scale datasets used for VLM
pre-training, yet emojis themselves are largely absent from standard robotics
datasets. Consequently, they provide a clean proxy: successful task completion
indicates effective transfer of VLM priors to embodied control. We implement
this diagnostic task in both simulated environment and a real robot, and
compare various promising techniques for knowledge transfer. Specifically, we
investigate the effects of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, VLM freezing,
co-training, predicting discretized actions, and predicting latent actions.
Through systematic evaluation, our work not only demonstrates the critical
importance of preserving VLM priors for the generalization of VLA but also
establishes guidelines for future research in developing truly generalizable
embodied AI systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06619v1,,False
SPUR: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Integrating Spatial Audio Understanding and Reasoning into Large Audio-Language Models,10/11/2025,"S Sakshi, Vaibhavi Lokegaonkar, Neil Zhang, Ramani Duraiswami, Sreyan Ghosh, Dinesh Manocha, Lie Lu","Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate
understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level
perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models
(LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural
inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction,
elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach
that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural
changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps
(W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features,
integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a
spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled
simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap
for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set
consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving
general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms
monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the
effectiveness of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.06606v1,,False
