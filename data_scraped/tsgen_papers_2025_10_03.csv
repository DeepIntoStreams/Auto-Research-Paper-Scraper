Learning to Generate Object Interactions with Physics-Guided Video Diffusion,02/10/2025,"David Romero, Ariana Bermudez, Hao Li, Fabio Pizzati, Ivan Laptev","Recent models for video generation have achieved remarkable progress and are
now deployed in film, social media production, and advertising. Beyond their
creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for
robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however,
current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object
interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this
limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video
generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and
effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method
generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We
propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion
supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion
models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate
significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore,
KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual
conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support
for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that
KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size.
Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and
high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made
publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02284v1,,False
PUL-Inter-slice Defender: An Anomaly Detection Solution for Distributed Slice Mobility Attacks,02/10/2025,"Ricardo Misael Ayala Molina, Hyame Assem Alameddine, Makan Pourzandi, Chadi Assi","Network Slices (NSs) are virtual networks operating over a shared physical
infrastructure, each designed to meet specific application requirements while
maintaining consistent Quality of Service (QoS). In Fifth Generation (5G)
networks, User Equipment (UE) can connect to and seamlessly switch between
multiple NSs to access diverse services. However, this flexibility, known as
Inter-Slice Switching (ISS), introduces a potential vulnerability that can be
exploited to launch Distributed Slice Mobility (DSM) attacks, a form of
Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. To secure 5G networks and their
NSs against DSM attacks, we present in this work, PUL-Inter-Slice Defender; an
anomaly detection solution that leverages Positive Unlabeled Learning (PUL) and
incorporates a combination of Long Short-Term Memory Autoencoders and K-Means
clustering. PUL-Inter-Slice Defender leverages the Third Generation Partnership
Project (3GPP) key performance indicators and performance measurement counters
as features for its machine learning models to detect DSM attack variants while
maintaining robustness in the presence of contaminated training data. When
evaluated on data collected from our 5G testbed based on the open-source
free5GC and UERANSIM, a UE/ Radio Access Network (RAN) simulator;
PUL-Inter-Slice Defender achieved F1-scores exceeding 98.50% on training
datasets with 10% to 40% attack contamination, consistently outperforming its

TempoControl: Temporal Attention Guidance for Text-to-Video Models,02/10/2025,"Shira Schiber, Ofir Lindenbaum, Idan Schwartz","Recent advances in generative video models have enabled the creation of
high-quality videos based on natural language prompts. However, these models
frequently lack fine-grained temporal control, meaning they do not allow users
to specify when particular visual elements should appear within a generated
sequence. In this work, we introduce TempoControl, a method that allows for
temporal alignment of visual concepts during inference, without requiring
retraining or additional supervision. TempoControl utilizes cross-attention
maps, a key component of text-to-video diffusion models, to guide the timing of
concepts through a novel optimization approach. Our method steers attention
using three complementary principles: aligning its temporal shape with a
control signal (via correlation), amplifying it where visibility is needed (via
energy), and maintaining spatial focus (via entropy). TempoControl allows
precise control over timing while ensuring high video quality and diversity. We
demonstrate its effectiveness across various video generation applications,
including temporal reordering for single and multiple objects, as well as
action and audio-aligned generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02226v1,,False
Efficiently Generating Correlated Sample Paths from Multi-step Time Series Foundation Models,02/10/2025,"Ethan Baron, Boris Oreshkin, Ruijun Ma, Hanyu Zhang, Kari Torkkola, Michael W. Mahoney, Andrew Gordon Wilson, Tatiana Konstantinova","Many time series applications require access to multi-step forecast
trajectories in the form of sample paths. Recently, time series foundation
models have leveraged multi-step lookahead predictions to improve the quality
and efficiency of multi-step forecasts. However, these models only predict
independent marginal distributions for each time step, rather than a full joint
predictive distribution. To generate forecast sample paths with realistic
correlation structures, one typically resorts to autoregressive sampling, which
can be extremely expensive. In this paper, we present a copula-based approach
to efficiently generate accurate, correlated sample paths from existing
multi-step time series foundation models in one forward pass. Our copula-based
approach generates correlated sample paths orders of magnitude faster than
autoregressive sampling, and it yields improved sample path quality by
mitigating the snowballing error phenomenon.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02224v1,,False
Diffusion Transformers for Imputation: Statistical Efficiency and Uncertainty Quantification,02/10/2025,"Zeqi Ye, Minshuo Chen","Imputation methods play a critical role in enhancing the quality of practical
time-series data, which often suffer from pervasive missing values. Recently,
diffusion-based generative imputation methods have demonstrated remarkable
success compared to autoregressive and conventional statistical approaches.
Despite their empirical success, the theoretical understanding of how well
diffusion-based models capture complex spatial and temporal dependencies
between the missing values and observed ones remains limited. Our work
addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional
diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in
missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds
based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using
transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing
values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation
are significantly influenced by the missing patterns. Furthermore, we validate
these theoretical insights through simulation and propose a mixed-masking
training strategy to enhance the imputation performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02216v1,,False
Poolformer: Recurrent Networks with Pooling for Long-Sequence Modeling,02/10/2025,Daniel Gallo Fern√°ndez,"Sequence-to-sequence models have become central in Artificial Intelligence,
particularly following the introduction of the transformer architecture. While
initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have
demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models
require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically
using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales
quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long
sequences.
  We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces
self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to
reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks,
which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an
up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive
experiments to support our architectural choices.
  Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves
perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also
suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow
layers take care of short-term features.
  Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths,
Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.
Future directions include applications to text and vision, as well as
multi-modal scenarios, where a Poolformer-based LLM could effectively process
dense representations of images and videos.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02206v1,,False
VarCoNet: A variability-aware self-supervised framework for functional connectome extraction from resting-state fMRI,02/10/2025,"Charalampos Lamprou, Aamna Alshehhi, Leontios J. Hadjileontiadis, Mohamed L. Seghier","Accounting for inter-individual variability in brain function is key to
precision medicine. Here, by considering functional inter-individual
variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an
enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC)
extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs
self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional
inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that
generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the
absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel
augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core,
VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series
processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our
VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject
fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii)
autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the
ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our
extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning
methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and
generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework

an entire video sequence or chunks of frames are available beforehand. This
critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content
creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we
introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model
autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video
frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our
knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for
this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame
latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a
decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision
conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest
variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token
per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained
through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to
accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay
videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and
temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both
objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame
waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on
30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100. Demo samples are available at

Unlocking Symbol-Level Precoding Efficiency Through Tensor Equivariant Neural Network,02/10/2025,"Jinshuo Zhang, Yafei Wang, Xinping Yi, Wenjin Wang, Shi Jin, Symeon Chatzinotas, Bj√∂rn Ottersten","Although symbol-level precoding (SLP) based on constructive interference (CI)
exploitation offers performance gains, its high complexity remains a
bottleneck. This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep
learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the
structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent
tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input
induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the
computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known
closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP)
and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a
mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on
which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that
delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging
these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE
module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we
design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary
variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures
substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately
80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong
generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02108v1,,False
KAIROS: Unified Training for Universal Non-Autoregressive Time Series Forecasting,02/10/2025,"Kuiye Ding, Fanda Fan, Zheya Wang, Hongxiao Li, Yifan Wang, Lei Wang, Chunjie Luo, Jianfeng Zhan","In the World Wide Web, reliable time series forecasts provide the
forward-looking signals that drive resource planning, cache placement, and

real-time decision making. We present KAIROS, a non-autoregressive time series
forecasting framework that directly models segment-level multi-peak

accumulation and achieves just-in-time inference, while improving over existing
non-autoregressive models that collapse to over-smoothed predictions. Trained
on the large-scale corpus, KAIROS demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization
on six widely used benchmarks, delivering forecasting performance comparable to
state-of-the-art foundation models with similar scale, at a fraction of their

Fine-Tuning Flow Matching via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of Reconstructions,02/10/2025,"Zhaoyi Li, Jingtao Ding, Yong Li, Shihua Li","Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks
especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion
models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient
training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we
cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other
generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction
loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high
precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's
over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems
such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via
Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by
FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first
theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error
in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood
Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning
and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically
designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the
contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's
robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and
robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference
performance of FM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02081v1,,False
Variational Secret Common Randomness Extraction,02/10/2025,"Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Peter J. Gu, Yiqi Chen, Ullrich J. M√∂nich, Holger Boche","This paper studies the problem of extracting common randomness (CR) or secret
keys from correlated random sources observed by two legitimate parties, Alice
and Bob, through public discussion in the presence of an eavesdropper, Eve. We
propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the
variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice
and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their
observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high
agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is
realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial
training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction
reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is
guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study
physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely
on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus
suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility
scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated
sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps
measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified
through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR)
measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's
position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of
both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation
method.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02048v1,,False
Zero-shot Human Pose Estimation using Diffusion-based Inverse solvers,02/10/2025,"Sahil Bhandary Karnoor, Romit Roy Choudhury","Pose estimation refers to tracking a human's full body posture, including
their head, torso, arms, and legs. The problem is challenging in practical
settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown
promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction
is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors.
Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users,
primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size
of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem
and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes
a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements
alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived
from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method
generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains
the sparse on-body measurements.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.02043v1,,False
Zero-shot reasoning for simulating scholarly peer-review,02/10/2025,Khalid M. Saqr,"The scholarly publishing ecosystem faces a dual crisis of unmanageable
submission volumes and unregulated AI, creating an urgent need for new
governance models to safeguard scientific integrity. The traditional human-only
peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial
processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic
simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard
for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review
simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that
demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated
editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority
outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt
to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains
unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring
compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and
scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably
rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific
community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing
strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing

ShapeGen3DCP: A Deep Learning Framework for Layer Shape Prediction in 3D Concrete Printing,02/10/2025,"Giacomo Rizzieri, Federico Lanteri, Liberato Ferrara, Massimiliano Cremonesi","This work introduces ShapeGen3DCP, a deep learning framework for fast and
accurate prediction of filament cross-sectional geometry in 3D Concrete
Printing (3DCP). The method is based on a neural network architecture that
takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield
stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle
height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer
shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into
dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted
geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce
smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a
small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated
using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP,
overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse
numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the
framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses
ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating
trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced
designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor

Multimodal Foundation Models for Early Disease Detection,02/10/2025,"Md Talha Mohsin, Ismail Abdulrashid","Healthcare generates diverse streams of data, including electronic health

foundation model that consolidates diverse patient data through an
attention-based transformer framework. At first, dedicated encoders put each
modality into a shared latent space. Then, they combine them using multi-head
attention and residual normalization. The architecture is made for pretraining
on many tasks, which makes it easy to adapt to new diseases and datasets with
little extra work. We provide an experimental strategy that uses benchmark
datasets in oncology, cardiology, and neurology, with the goal of testing early

A Modular Theory of Subjective Consciousness for Natural and Artificial Minds,02/10/2025,Micha√´l Gillon,"Understanding how subjective experience arises from information processing
remains a central challenge in neuroscience, cognitive science, and AI
research. The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically
grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a
discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a
packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector
that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with
subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience.
Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules
(abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an
IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to
behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop.
This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term
memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information
Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline
producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure.
Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with
functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress
enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both
biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an
irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature
of complex information processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01864v1,,False
NGGAN: Noise Generation GAN Based on the Practical Measurement Dataset for Narrowband Powerline Communications,02/10/2025,"Ying-Ren Chien, Po-Heng Chou, You-Jie Peng, Chun-Yuan Huang, Hen-Wai Tsao, Yu Tsao","Capturing comprehensive statistics of nonperiodic asynchronous impulsive
noise is a critical issue in enhancing impulse noise processing for narrowband
powerline communication (NB-PLC) transceivers. However, existing mathematical
noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive
noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the
noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of
practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the
statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise
via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC
modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches
based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the
length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate
cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss
function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training
dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various
applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based
models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform
quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a
piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a
frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC
systems. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed NGGAN trained using
waveform characteristics is closer to the practically measured dataset in terms
of the quality of the generated noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.01850v1,10.1109/TIM.2024.3523361,False
Neural non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics for long-time simulations,02/10/2025,"Cl√©mentine Court√®s, Emmanuel Franck, Michael Kraus, Laurent Navoret, L√©opold Tr√©mant","This work focuses on learning non-canonical Hamiltonian dynamics from data,

experiments, the learnt model is sometimes numerically unstable due to the
gauge dependency of the scheme, rendering long-time simulations impossible. In
this paper, we identify this problem and propose two different training
strategies to address it, either by directly learning the vector field or by
learning a time-discrete dynamics through the scheme. Several numerical test

PolySim: Bridging the Sim-to-Real Gap for Humanoid Control via Multi-Simulator Dynamics Randomization,02/10/2025,"Zixing Lei, Zibo Zhou, Sheng Yin, Yueru Chen, Qingyao Xu, Weixin Li, Yunhong Wang, Bowei Tang, Wei Jing, Siheng Chen","Humanoid whole-body control (WBC) policies trained in simulation often suffer
from the sim-to-real gap, which fundamentally arises from simulator inductive
bias, the inherent assumptions and limitations of any single simulator. These
biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between
simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive
bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators,
encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond
any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training
platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch
parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single
training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization.
Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator
inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim
substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for
example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim
baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1

Median2Median: Zero-shot Suppression of Structured Noise in Images,02/10/2025,"Jianxu Wang, Ge Wang","Image denoising is a fundamental problem in computer vision and medical
imaging. However, real-world images are often degraded by structured noise with
strong anisotropic correlations that existing methods struggle to remove. Most
data-driven approaches rely on large datasets with high-quality labels and
still suffer from limited generalizability, whereas existing zero-shot methods
avoid this limitation but remain effective only for independent and identically
distributed (i.i.d.) noise. To address this gap, we propose Median2Median
(M2M), a zero-shot denoising framework designed for structured noise. M2M
introduces a novel sampling strategy that generates pseudo-independent
sub-image pairs from a single noisy input. This strategy leverages directional
interpolation and generalized median filtering to adaptively exclude values
distorted by structured artifacts. To further enlarge the effective sampling
space and eliminate systematic bias, a randomized assignment strategy is
employed, ensuring that the sampled sub-image pairs are suitable for
Noise2Noise training. In our realistic simulation studies, M2M performs on par
with state-of-the-art zero-shot methods under i.i.d. noise, while consistently
outperforming them under correlated noise. These findings establish M2M as an

Source-Free Cross-Domain Continual Learning,02/10/2025,"Muhammad Tanzil Furqon, Mahardhika Pratama, Igor ≈†krjanc, Lin Liu, Habibullah Habibullah, Kutluyil Dogancay","Although existing cross-domain continual learning approaches successfully
address many streaming tasks having domain shifts, they call for a fully
labeled source domain hindering their feasibility in the privacy constrained
environments. This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free
cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are
completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware
dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled
source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is
built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale
vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal
generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain
shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a
frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while
suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware
augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label
problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy
where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties,
thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label. Besides, the
issue of catastrophic forgetting (CF) is overcome by kernel linear discriminant
analysis (KLDA) where the backbone network is frozen while the classification

TetriServe: Efficient DiT Serving for Heterogeneous Image Generation,02/10/2025,"Runyu Lu, Shiqi He, Wenxuan Tan, Shenggui Li, Ruofan Wu, Jeff J. Ma, Ang Chen, Mosharaf Chowdhury","Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models excel at generating highquality images

round-based scheduling mechanism that improves SLO attainment: (1) discretizing
time into fixed rounds to make deadline-aware scheduling tractable, (2)
adapting parallelism at the step level and minimize GPU hour consumption, and
(3) jointly packing requests to minimize late completions. Extensive evaluation

preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable
predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to
specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic
framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this

external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted
preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by
leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster
performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively
selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final

nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects
probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for
isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock

driver: typicality bias in preference data, whereby annotators systematically
favor familiar text as a result of well-established findings in cognitive
psychology. We formalize this bias theoretically, verify it on preference
datasets empirically, and show that it plays a central role in mode collapse.
Motivated by this analysis, we introduce Verbalized Sampling, a simple,

"Hybrid Predictive Modeling of Malaria Incidence in the Amhara Region, Ethiopia: Integrating Multi-Output Regression and Time-Series Forecasting",01/10/2025,"Kassahun Azezew, Amsalu Tesema, Bitew Mekuria, Ayenew Kassie, Animut Embiale, Ayodeji Olalekan Salau, Tsega Asresa","Malaria remains a major public health concern in Ethiopia, particularly in
the Amhara Region, where seasonal and unpredictable transmission patterns make
prevention and control challenging. Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is
essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This
study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series
forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based
prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past
malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health
centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression
approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including
Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations,

among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than
single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable

Adaptive Federated Few-Shot Rare-Disease Diagnosis with Energy-Aware Secure Aggregation,01/10/2025,Aueaphum Aueawatthanaphisut,"Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited

few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These

neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over

Can World Models Benefit VLMs for World Dynamics?,01/10/2025,"Kevin Zhang, Kuangzhi Ge, Xiaowei Chi, Renrui Zhang, Shaojun Shi, Zhen Dong, Sirui Han, Shanghang Zhang","Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are

multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing

significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization

shear-wave velocity (VS). For regional-scale studies, efforts to predict VS
remotely, such as the U.S. Geological Survey's National Crustal Model, tend to
emphasize deeper lithologic velocity structures, thus simplifying important
near-surface soil velocity variations, and tend to be produced at relatively
coarse geospatial resolution for one geographic area. In this study, we define
a functional form to describe VS-with-depth across the conterminous U.S. We
calibrate the parameters of the function using a national compilation of more
than 9,000 in-situ geotechnical measurements. By coupling the parametric
framework with geospatial machine learning, the model can be leveraged to
provide consistent, high resolution VS-depth predictions of the near-surface
geotechnical layer across the U.S., complementing the National Crustal Model
and supporting applications such as physics-based ground motion simulations and
coseismic hazard assessments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00372v1,,False
CINDES: Classification induced neural density estimator and simulator,01/10/2025,"Dehao Dai, Jianqing Fan, Yihong Gu, Debarghya Mukherjee","Neural network-based methods for (un)conditional density estimation have
recently gained substantial attention, as various neural density estimators
have outperformed classical approaches in real-data experiments. Despite these
empirical successes, implementation can be challenging due to the need to
ensure non-negativity and unit-mass constraints, and theoretical understanding
remains limited. In particular, it is unclear whether such estimators can
adaptively achieve faster convergence rates when the underlying density
exhibits a low-dimensional structure. This paper addresses these gaps by
proposing a structure-agnostic neural density estimator that is (i)
straightforward to implement and (ii) provably adaptive, attaining faster rates
when the true density admits a low-dimensional composition structure. Another
key contribution of our work is to show that the proposed estimator integrates
naturally into generative sampling pipelines, most notably score-based
diffusion models, where it achieves provably faster convergence when the
underlying density is structured. We validate its performance through extensive
simulations and a real-data application.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.00367v1,,False
