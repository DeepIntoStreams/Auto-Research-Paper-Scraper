StyleMotif: Multi-Modal Motion Stylization using Style-Content Cross Fusion,27/03/2025,"Ziyu Guo, Young Yoon Lee, Joseph Liu, Yizhak Ben-Shabat, Victor Zordan, Mubbasir Kapadia","We present StyleMotif, a novel Stylized Motion Latent Diffusion model,
generating motion conditioned on both content and style from multiple
modalities. Unlike existing approaches that either focus on generating diverse
motion content or transferring style from sequences, StyleMotif seamlessly
synthesizes motion across a wide range of content while incorporating stylistic
cues from multi-modal inputs, including motion, text, image, video, and audio.
To achieve this, we introduce a style-content cross fusion mechanism and align
a style encoder with a pre-trained multi-modal model, ensuring that the
generated motion accurately captures the reference style while preserving
realism. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework surpasses
existing methods in stylized motion generation and exhibits emergent
capabilities for multi-modal motion stylization, enabling more nuanced motion
synthesis. Source code and pre-trained models will be released upon acceptance.

LLM-Gomoku: A Large Language Model-Based System for Strategic Gomoku with Self-Play and Reinforcement Learning,27/03/2025,Hui Wang,"In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown significant
advancements in natural language processing (NLP), with strong capa-bilities in
generation, comprehension, and rea-soning. These models have found applications
in education, intelligent decision-making, and gaming. However, effectively
utilizing LLMs for strategic planning and decision-making in the game of Gomoku
remains a challenge. This study aims to develop a Gomoku AI system based on
LLMs, simulating the human learning process of playing chess. The system is
de-signed to understand and apply Gomoku strat-egies and logic to make rational
decisions. The research methods include enabling the model to ""read the board,""
""understand the rules,"" ""select strategies,"" and ""evaluate positions,"" while
en-hancing its abilities through self-play and rein-forcement learning. The
results demonstrate that this approach significantly improves the se-lection of
move positions, resolves the issue of generating illegal positions, and reduces
pro-cess time through parallel position evaluation. After extensive self-play
training, the model's Gomoku-playing capabilities have been notably enhanced.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21683v1,,False
Unlocking the Potential of Past Research: Using Generative AI to Reconstruct Healthcare Simulation Models,27/03/2025,"Thomas Monks, Alison Harper, Amy Heather","Discrete-event simulation (DES) is widely used in healthcare Operations
Research, but the models themselves are rarely shared. This limits their
potential for reuse and long-term impact in the modelling and healthcare
communities. This study explores the feasibility of using generative artificial
intelligence (AI) to recreate published models using Free and Open Source
Software (FOSS), based on the descriptions provided in an academic journal.
Using a structured methodology, we successfully generated, tested and
internally reproduced two DES models, including user interfaces. The reported
results were replicated for one model, but not the other, likely due to missing
information on distributions. These models are substantially more complex than
AI-generated DES models published to date. Given the challenges we faced in
prompt engineering, code generation, and model testing, we conclude that our
iterative approach to model development, systematic comparison and testing, and
the expertise of our team were necessary to the success of our recreated
simulation models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21646v1,,False
Towards Fully Automated Decision-Making Systems for Greenhouse Control: Challenges and Opportunities,27/03/2025,"Yongshuai Liu, Taeyeong Choi, Xin Liu","Machine learning has been successful in building control policies to drive a
complex system to desired states in various applications (e.g. games, robotics,
etc.). To be specific, a number of parameters of policy can be automatically
optimized from the observations of environment to be able to generate a
sequence of decisions leading to the best performance. In this survey paper, we
particularly explore such policy-learning techniques for another unique,
practical use-case scenario--farming, in which critical decisions (e.g., water
supply, heating, etc.) must be made in a timely manner to minimize risks (e.g.,
damage to plants) while maximizing the revenue (e.g., healthy crops) in the
end. We first provide a broad overview of latest studies on it to identify not
only domain-specific challenges but opportunities with potential solutions,
some of which are suggested as promising directions for future research. Also,
we then introduce our successful approach to being ranked second among 46 teams
at the ''3rd Autonomous Greenhouse Challenge'' to use this specific example to
discuss the lessons learned about important considerations for design to create
autonomous farm-management systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21640v1,,False
Data-Driven Extreme Response Estimation,27/03/2025,"Samuel J. Edwards, Michael D. Levine","A method to rapidly estimate extreme ship response events is developed in
this paper. The method involves training by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
neural network to correct a lower-fidelity hydrodynamic model to the level of a
higher-fidelity simulation. More focus is placed on larger responses by
isolating the time-series near peak events identified in the lower-fidelity
simulations and training on only the shorter time-series around the large
event. The method is tested on the estimation of pitch time-series maxima in
Sea State 5 (significant wave height of 4.0 meters and modal period of 15.0
seconds,) generated by a lower-fidelity hydrodynamic solver known as SimpleCode
and a higher-fidelity tool known as the Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP).
The results are also compared with an LSTM trained without special
considerations for large events.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21638v1,,False
Critical Iterative Denoising: A Discrete Generative Model Applied to Graphs,27/03/2025,"Yoann Boget, Alexandros Kalousis","Discrete Diffusion and Flow Matching models have significantly advanced
generative modeling for discrete structures, including graphs. However, the
time dependencies in the noising process of these models lead to error
accumulation and propagation during the backward process. This issue,
particularly pronounced in mask diffusion, is a known limitation in sequence
modeling and, as we demonstrate, also impacts discrete diffusion models for
graphs.
  To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Iterative
Denoising, which simplifies discrete diffusion and circumvents the issue by
assuming conditional independence across time. Additionally, we enhance our
model by incorporating a Critic, which during generation selectively retains or
corrupts elements in an instance based on their likelihood under the data
distribution. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that the proposed method
significantly outperforms existing discrete diffusion baselines in graph
generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21592v1,,False
Probabilistic Functional Neural Networks,27/03/2025,"Haixu Wang, Jiguo Cao","High-dimensional functional time series (HDFTS) are often characterized by
nonlinear trends and high spatial dimensions. Such data poses unique challenges
for modeling and forecasting due to the nonlinearity, nonstationarity, and high
dimensionality. We propose a novel probabilistic functional neural network
(ProFnet) to address these challenges. ProFnet integrates the strengths of
feedforward and deep neural networks with probabilistic modeling. The model
generates probabilistic forecasts using Monte Carlo sampling and also enables
the quantification of uncertainty in predictions. While capturing both temporal
and spatial dependencies across multiple regions, ProFnet offers a scalable and
unified solution for large datasets. Applications to Japan's mortality rates
demonstrate superior performance. This approach enhances predictive accuracy
and provides interpretable uncertainty estimates, making it a valuable tool for
forecasting complex high-dimensional functional data and HDFTS.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21585v1,,False
Magnitude-Phase Dual-Path Speech Enhancement Network based on Self-Supervised Embedding and Perceptual Contrast Stretch Boosting,27/03/2025,"Alimjan Mattursun, Liejun Wang, Yinfeng Yu, Chunyang Ma","Speech self-supervised learning (SSL) has made great progress in various
speech processing tasks, but there is still room for improvement in speech
enhancement (SE). This paper presents BSP-MPNet, a dual-path framework that
combines self-supervised features with magnitude-phase information for SE. The
approach starts by applying the perceptual contrast stretching (PCS) algorithm
to enhance the magnitude-phase spectrum. A magnitude-phase 2D coarse (MP-2DC)
encoder then extracts coarse features from the enhanced spectrum. Next, a
feature-separating self-supervised learning (FS-SSL) model generates
self-supervised embeddings for the magnitude and phase components separately.
These embeddings are fused to create cross-domain feature representations.
Finally, two parallel RNN-enhanced multi-attention (REMA) mask decoders refine
the features, apply them to the mask, and reconstruct the speech signal. We
evaluate BSP-MPNet on the VoiceBank+DEMAND and WHAMR! datasets. Experimental
results show that BSP-MPNet outperforms existing methods under various noise
conditions, providing new directions for self-supervised speech enhancement
research. The implementation of the BSP-MPNet code is available
online\footnote[2]{https://github.com/AlimMat/BSP-MPNet. \label{s1}}",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21571v1,,False
Consistent Multigroup Low-Rank Approximation,27/03/2025,"Antonis Matakos, Martino Ciaperoni, Heikki Mannila","We consider the problem of consistent low-rank approximation for multigroup
data: we ask for a sequence of $k$ basis vectors such that projecting the data
onto their spanned subspace treats all groups as equally as possible, by
minimizing the maximum error among the groups. Additionally, we require that
the sequence of basis vectors satisfies the natural consistency property: when
looking for the best $k$ vectors, the first $d<k$ vectors are the best possible
solution to the problem of finding $d$ basis vectors. Thus, this multigroup
low-rank approximation method naturally generalizes \svd and reduces to \svd
for data with a single group. We give an iterative algorithm for this task that
sequentially adds to the basis the vector that gives the best rank$-1$
projection according to the min-max criterion, and then projects the data onto
the orthogonal complement of that vector. For finding the best rank$-1$
projection, we use primal-dual approaches or semidefinite programming. We
analyze the theoretical properties of the algorithms and demonstrate
empirically that the proposed methods compare favorably to existing methods for
multigroup (or fair) PCA.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21563v1,,False
DeepRV: pre-trained spatial priors for accelerated disease mapping,27/03/2025,"Jhonathan Navott, Daniel Jenson, Seth Flaxman, Elizaveta Semenova","Recently introduced prior-encoding deep generative models (e.g., PriorVAE,
$\pi$VAE, and PriorCVAE) have emerged as powerful tools for scalable Bayesian
inference by emulating complex stochastic processes like Gaussian processes
(GPs). However, these methods remain largely a proof-of-concept and
inaccessible to practitioners. We propose DeepRV, a lightweight, decoder-only
approach that accelerates training, and enhances real-world applicability in
comparison to current VAE-based prior encoding approaches. Leveraging
probabilistic programming frameworks (e.g., NumPyro) for inference, DeepRV
achieves significant speedups while also improving the quality of parameter
inference, closely matching full MCMC sampling. We showcase its effectiveness
in process emulation and spatial analysis of the UK using simulated data,
gender-wise cancer mortality rates for individuals under 50, and HIV prevalence
in Zimbabwe. To bridge the gap between theory and practice, we provide a
user-friendly API, enabling scalable and efficient Bayesian inference.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21473v1,,False
"Exploring the Roles of Large Language Models in Reshaping Transportation Systems: A Survey, Framework, and Roadmap",27/03/2025,"Tong Nie, Jian Sun, Wei Ma","Modern transportation systems face pressing challenges due to increasing
demand, dynamic environments, and heterogeneous information integration. The
rapid evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) offers transformative potential
to address these challenges. Extensive knowledge and high-level capabilities
derived from pretraining evolve the default role of LLMs as text generators to
become versatile, knowledge-driven task solvers for intelligent transportation
systems. This survey first presents LLM4TR, a novel conceptual framework that
systematically categorizes the roles of LLMs in transportation into four
synergetic dimensions: information processors, knowledge encoders, component
generators, and decision facilitators. Through a unified taxonomy, we
systematically elucidate how LLMs bridge fragmented data pipelines, enhance
predictive analytics, simulate human-like reasoning, and enable closed-loop
interactions across sensing, learning, modeling, and managing tasks in
transportation systems. For each role, our review spans diverse applications,
from traffic prediction and autonomous driving to safety analytics and urban
mobility optimization, highlighting how emergent capabilities of LLMs such as
in-context learning and step-by-step reasoning can enhance the operation and
management of transportation systems. We further curate practical guidance,
including available resources and computational guidelines, to support
real-world deployment. By identifying challenges in existing LLM-based
solutions, this survey charts a roadmap for advancing LLM-driven transportation
research, positioning LLMs as central actors in the next generation of
cyber-physical-social mobility ecosystems. Online resources can be found in the

Neuro-Symbolic Imitation Learning: Discovering Symbolic Abstractions for Skill Learning,27/03/2025,"Leon Keller, Daniel Tanneberg, Jan Peters","Imitation learning is a popular method for teaching robots new behaviors.
However, most existing methods focus on teaching short, isolated skills rather
than long, multi-step tasks. To bridge this gap, imitation learning algorithms
must not only learn individual skills but also an abstract understanding of how
to sequence these skills to perform extended tasks effectively. This paper
addresses this challenge by proposing a neuro-symbolic imitation learning
framework. Using task demonstrations, the system first learns a symbolic
representation that abstracts the low-level state-action space. The learned
representation decomposes a task into easier subtasks and allows the system to
leverage symbolic planning to generate abstract plans. Subsequently, the system
utilizes this task decomposition to learn a set of neural skills capable of
refining abstract plans into actionable robot commands. Experimental results in
three simulated robotic environments demonstrate that, compared to baselines,
our neuro-symbolic approach increases data efficiency, improves generalization
capabilities, and facilitates interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21406v1,,False
Simulation-informed deep learning for enhanced SWOT observations of fine-scale ocean dynamics,27/03/2025,"Eugenio Cutolo, Carlos Granero-Belinchon, Ptashanna Thiraux, Jinbo Wang, Ronan Fablet","Oceanic processes at fine scales are crucial yet difficult to observe
accurately due to limitations in satellite and in-situ measurements. The
Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) mission provides high-resolution Sea
Surface Height (SSH) data, though noise patterns often obscure fine scale
structures. Current methods struggle with noisy data or require extensive
supervised training, limiting their effectiveness on real-world observations.
We introduce SIMPGEN (Simulation-Informed Metric and Prior for Generative
Ensemble Networks), an unsupervised adversarial learning framework combining
real SWOT observations with simulated reference data. SIMPGEN leverages
wavelet-informed neural metrics to distinguish noisy from clean fields, guiding
realistic SSH reconstructions. Applied to SWOT data, SIMPGEN effectively
removes noise, preserving fine-scale features better than existing neural
methods. This robust, unsupervised approach not only improves SWOT SSH data
interpretation but also demonstrates strong potential for broader oceanographic
applications, including data assimilation and super-resolution.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21303v1,,False
Dual-Splitting Conformal Prediction for Multi-Step Time Series Forecasting,27/03/2025,"Qingdi Yu, Zhiwei Cao, Ruihang Wang, Zhen Yang, Lijun Deng, Min Hu, Yong Luo, Xin Zhou","Time series forecasting is crucial for applications like resource scheduling
and risk management, where multi-step predictions provide a comprehensive view
of future trends. Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is a mainstream approach for
addressing forecasting uncertainties, with Conformal Prediction (CP) gaining
attention due to its model-agnostic nature and statistical guarantees. However,
most variants of CP are designed for single-step predictions and face
challenges in multi-step scenarios, such as reliance on real-time data and
limited scalability. This highlights the need for CP methods specifically
tailored to multi-step forecasting. We propose the Dual-Splitting Conformal
Prediction (DSCP) method, a novel CP approach designed to capture inherent
dependencies within time-series data for multi-step forecasting. Experimental
results on real-world datasets from four different domains demonstrate that the
proposed DSCP significantly outperforms existing CP variants in terms of the
Winkler Score, achieving a performance improvement of up to 23.59% compared to
state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we deployed the DSCP approach for
renewable energy generation and IT load forecasting in power management of a
real-world trajectory-based application, achieving an 11.25% reduction in
carbon emissions through predictive optimization of data center operations and

Learning Generalizable Skills from Offline Multi-Task Data for Multi-Agent Cooperation,27/03/2025,"Sicong Liu, Yang Shu, Chenjuan Guo, Bin Yang","Learning cooperative multi-agent policy from offline multi-task data that can
generalize to unseen tasks with varying numbers of agents and targets is an
attractive problem in many scenarios. Although aggregating general behavior
patterns among multiple tasks as skills to improve policy transfer is a
promising approach, two primary challenges hinder the further advancement of
skill learning in offline multi-task MARL. Firstly, extracting general
cooperative behaviors from various action sequences as common skills lacks
bringing cooperative temporal knowledge into them. Secondly, existing works
only involve common skills and can not adaptively choose independent knowledge
as task-specific skills in each task for fine-grained action execution. To
tackle these challenges, we propose Hierarchical and Separate Skill Discovery
(HiSSD), a novel approach for generalizable offline multi-task MARL through
skill learning. HiSSD leverages a hierarchical framework that jointly learns
common and task-specific skills. The common skills learn cooperative temporal
knowledge and enable in-sample exploitation for offline multi-task MARL. The
task-specific skills represent the priors of each task and achieve a
task-guided fine-grained action execution. To verify the advancement of our
method, we conduct experiments on multi-agent MuJoCo and SMAC benchmarks. After
training the policy using HiSSD on offline multi-task data, the empirical
results show that HiSSD assigns effective cooperative behaviors and obtains
superior performance in unseen tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21200v1,,False
Unveiling the Power of Uncertainty: A Journey into Bayesian Neural Networks for Stellar dating,27/03/2025,"Víctor Tamames-Rodero, Andrés Moya, Roberto Javier López, Luis Manuel Sarro","Context: Astronomy and astrophysics demand rigorous handling of uncertainties
to ensure the credibility of outcomes. The growing integration of artificial
intelligence offers a novel avenue to address this necessity. This convergence
presents an opportunity to create advanced models capable of quantifying
diverse sources of uncertainty and automating complex data relationship
exploration.
  What: We introduce a hierarchical Bayesian architecture whose probabilistic
relationships are modeled by neural networks, designed to forecast stellar
attributes such as mass, radius, and age (our main target). This architecture
handles both observational uncertainties stemming from measurements and
epistemic uncertainties inherent in the predictive model itself. As a result,
our system generates distributions that encapsulate the potential range of
values for our predictions, providing a comprehensive understanding of their
variability and robustness.
  Methods: Our focus is on dating main sequence stars using a technique known
as Chemical Clocks, which serves as both our primary astronomical challenge and
a model prototype. In this work, we use hierarchical architectures to account
for correlations between stellar parameters and optimize information extraction
from our dataset. We also employ Bayesian neural networks for their versatility
and flexibility in capturing complex data relationships.
  Results: By integrating our machine learning algorithm into a Bayesian
framework, we have successfully propagated errors consistently and managed
uncertainty treatment effectively, resulting in predictions characterized by
broader uncertainty margins. This approach facilitates more conservative
estimates in stellar dating. Our architecture achieves age predictions with a
mean absolute error of less than 1 Ga for the stars in the test dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.21153v1,,False
A computational theory of evaluation for parameterisable subject,27/03/2025,Hedong Yan,"Evaluation is critical to advance decision making across domains, yet

We prove upper bounds of generalized evaluation error and generalized causal
effect error of evaluation metric on subject. We also prove efficiency, and
consistency to estimated causal effect of subject on metric by prediction. To
