TimeFilter: Patch-Specific Spatial-Temporal Graph Filtration for Time Series Forecasting,22/01/2025,"Yifan Hu, Guibin Zhang, Peiyuan Liu, Disen Lan, Naiqi Li, Dawei Cheng, Tao Dai, Shu-Tao Xia, Shirui Pan","Current time series forecasting methods can be broadly classified into two
categories: Channel Independent (CI) and Channel Dependent (CD) strategies,
both aiming to capture the complex dependencies within time series data.
However, the CI strategy fails to exploit highly correlated covariate
information, while the CD strategy integrates all dependencies, including
irrelevant or noisy ones, thus compromising generalization. To mitigate these
issues, recent works have introduced the Channel Clustering (CC) strategy by
grouping channels with similar characteristics and applying different modeling
techniques to each cluster. However, coarse-grained clustering cannot flexibly
capture complex, time-varying interactions. Addressing the above challenges, we
propose TimeFilter, a graph-based framework for adaptive and fine-grained
dependency modeling. Specifically, after constructing the graph with the input
sequence, TimeFilter filters out irrelevant correlations and preserves the most
critical ones through patch-specific filtering. Extensive experiments on 13
real-world datasets from various application domains demonstrate the
state-of-the-art performance of TimeFilter. The code is available at

A Novel Tracking Framework for Devices in X-ray Leveraging Supplementary Cue-Driven Self-Supervised Features,22/01/2025,"Saahil Islam, Venkatesh N. Murthy, Dominik Neumann, Serkan Cimen, Puneet Sharma, Andreas Maier, Dorin Comaniciu, Florin C. Ghesu","To restore proper blood flow in blocked coronary arteries via angioplasty
procedure, accurate placement of devices such as catheters, balloons, and
stents under live fluoroscopy or diagnostic angiography is crucial. Identified
balloon markers help in enhancing stent visibility in X-ray sequences, while
the catheter tip aids in precise navigation and co-registering vessel
structures, reducing the need for contrast in angiography. However, accurate
detection of these devices in interventional X-ray sequences faces significant
challenges, particularly due to occlusions from contrasted vessels and other
devices and distractions from surrounding, resulting in the failure to track
such small objects. While most tracking methods rely on spatial correlation of
past and current appearance, they often lack strong motion comprehension
essential for navigating through these challenging conditions, and fail to
effectively detect multiple instances in the scene. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a self-supervised learning approach that enhances its
spatio-temporal understanding by incorporating supplementary cues and learning
across multiple representation spaces on a large dataset. Followed by that, we
introduce a generic real-time tracking framework that effectively leverages the
pretrained spatio-temporal network and also takes the historical appearance and
trajectory data into account. This results in enhanced localization of multiple
instances of device landmarks. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods
in interventional X-ray device tracking, especially stability and robustness,
achieving an 87% reduction in max error for balloon marker detection and a 61%
reduction in max error for catheter tip detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12958v1,10.1007/978-3-031-72089-5_3,False
Offline Critic-Guided Diffusion Policy for Multi-User Delay-Constrained Scheduling,22/01/2025,"Zhuoran Li, Ruishuo Chen, Hai Zhong, Longbo Huang","Effective multi-user delay-constrained scheduling is crucial in various
real-world applications, such as instant messaging, live streaming, and data
center management. In these scenarios, schedulers must make real-time decisions
to satisfy both delay and resource constraints without prior knowledge of
system dynamics, which are often time-varying and challenging to estimate.
Current learning-based methods typically require interactions with actual
systems during the training stage, which can be difficult or impractical, as it
is capable of significantly degrading system performance and incurring
substantial service costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel
offline reinforcement learning-based algorithm, named \underline{S}cheduling By
\underline{O}ffline Learning with \underline{C}ritic Guidance and
\underline{D}iffusion Generation (SOCD), to learn efficient scheduling policies
purely from pre-collected \emph{offline data}. SOCD innovatively employs a
diffusion-based policy network, complemented by a sampling-free critic network
for policy guidance. By integrating the Lagrangian multiplier optimization into
the offline reinforcement learning, SOCD effectively trains high-quality
constraint-aware policies exclusively from available datasets, eliminating the
need for online interactions with the system. Experimental results demonstrate
that SOCD is resilient to various system dynamics, including partially
observable and large-scale environments, and delivers superior performance
compared to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12942v1,,False
Learning Graph Node Embeddings by Smooth Pair Sampling,22/01/2025,Konstantin Kutzkov,"Random walk-based node embedding algorithms have attracted a lot of attention
due to their scalability and ease of implementation. Previous research has
focused on different walk strategies, optimization objectives, and embedding
learning models. Inspired by observations on real data, we take a different
approach and propose a new regularization technique. More precisely, the
frequencies of node pairs generated by the skip-gram model on random walk node
sequences follow a highly skewed distribution which causes learning to be
dominated by a fraction of the pairs. We address the issue by designing an
efficient sampling procedure that generates node pairs according to their {\em
smoothed frequency}. Theoretical and experimental results demonstrate the
advantages of our approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12884v1,,False
Mutation-Guided LLM-based Test Generation at Meta,22/01/2025,"Christopher Foster, Abhishek Gulati, Mark Harman, Inna Harper, Ke Mao, Jillian Ritchey, Hervé Robert, Shubho Sengupta","This paper describes Meta's ACH system for mutation-guided LLM-based test
generation. ACH generates relatively few mutants (aka simulated faults),
compared to traditional mutation testing. Instead, it focuses on generating
currently undetected faults that are specific to an issue of concern. From
these currently uncaught faults, ACH generates tests that can catch them,
thereby `killing' the mutants and consequently hardening the platform against
regressions. We use privacy concerns to illustrate our approach, but ACH can
harden code against {\em any} type of regression. In total, ACH was applied to
10,795 Android Kotlin classes in 7 software platforms deployed by Meta, from
which it generated 9,095 mutants and 571 privacy-hardening test cases. ACH also
deploys an LLM-based equivalent mutant detection agent that achieves a
precision of 0.79 and a recall of 0.47 (rising to 0.95 and 0.96 with simple
pre-processing). ACH was used by Messenger and WhatsApp test-a-thons where
engineers accepted 73% of its tests, judging 36% to privacy relevant. We
conclude that ACH hardens code against specific concerns and that, even when
its tests do not directly tackle the specific concern, engineers find them
useful for their other benefits.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12862v1,,False
Modality Unified Attack for Omni-Modality Person Re-Identification,22/01/2025,"Yuan Bian, Min Liu, Yunqi Yi, Xueping Wang, Yunfeng Ma, Yaonan Wang","Deep learning based person re-identification (re-id) models have been widely
employed in surveillance systems. Recent studies have demonstrated that
black-box single-modality and cross-modality re-id models are vulnerable to
adversarial examples (AEs), leaving the robustness of multi-modality re-id
models unexplored. Due to the lack of knowledge about the specific type of
model deployed in the target black-box surveillance system, we aim to generate
modality unified AEs for omni-modality (single-, cross- and multi-modality)
re-id models. Specifically, we propose a novel Modality Unified Attack method
to train modality-specific adversarial generators to generate AEs that
effectively attack different omni-modality models. A multi-modality model is
adopted as the surrogate model, wherein the features of each modality are
perturbed by metric disruption loss before fusion. To collapse the common
features of omni-modality models, Cross Modality Simulated Disruption approach
is introduced to mimic the cross-modality feature embeddings by intentionally
feeding images to non-corresponding modality-specific subnetworks of the
surrogate model. Moreover, Multi Modality Collaborative Disruption strategy is
devised to facilitate the attacker to comprehensively corrupt the informative
content of person images by leveraging a multi modality feature collaborative
metric disruption loss. Extensive experiments show that our MUA method can
effectively attack the omni-modality re-id models, achieving 55.9%, 24.4%,
49.0% and 62.7% mean mAP Drop Rate, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12761v1,,False
The Marginal Importance of Distortions and Alignment in CASSI systems,22/01/2025,"Léo Paillet, Antoine Rouxel, Hervé Carfantan, Simon Lacroix, Antoine Monmayrant","This paper introduces a differentiable ray-tracing based model that
incorporates aberrations and distortions to render realistic coded
hyperspectral acquisitions using Coded-Aperture Spectral Snapshot Imagers
(CASSI). CASSI systems can now be optimized in order to fulfill simultaneously
several optical design constraints as well as processing constraints. Four
comparable CASSI systems with varying degree of optical aberrations have been
designed and modeled. The resulting rendered hyperspectral acquisitions from
each of these systems are combined with five state-of-the-art hyperspectral
cube reconstruction processes. These reconstruction processes encompass a
mapping function created from each system's propagation model to account for
distortions and aberrations during the reconstruction process. Our analyses
show that if properly modeled, the effects of geometric distortions of the
system and misalignments of the dispersive elements have a marginal impact on
the overall quality of the reconstructed hyperspectral data cubes. Therefore,
relaxing traditional constraints on measurement conformity and fidelity to the
scene enables the development of novel imaging instruments, guided by
performance metrics applied to the design or the processing of acquisitions. By
providing a complete framework for design, simulation and evaluation, this work
contributes to the optimization and exploration of new CASSI systems, and more
generally to the computational imaging community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12705v1,,False
Adaptive Data Exploitation in Deep Reinforcement Learning,22/01/2025,"Mingqi Yuan, Bo Li, Xin Jin, Wenjun Zeng","We introduce ADEPT: Adaptive Data ExPloiTation, a simple yet powerful
framework to enhance the **data efficiency** and **generalization** in deep
reinforcement learning (RL). Specifically, ADEPT adaptively manages the use of
sampled data across different learning stages via multi-armed bandit (MAB)
algorithms, optimizing data utilization while mitigating overfitting. Moreover,
ADEPT can significantly reduce the computational overhead and accelerate a wide
range of RL algorithms. We test ADEPT on benchmarks including Procgen,
MiniGrid, and PyBullet. Extensive simulation demonstrates that ADEPT can
achieve superior performance with remarkable computational efficiency, offering

Ultralow-dimensionality reduction for identifying critical transitions by spatial-temporal PCA,22/01/2025,"Pei Chen, Yaofang Suo, Rui Liu, Luonan Chen","Discovering dominant patterns and exploring dynamic behaviors especially
critical state transitions and tipping points in high-dimensional time-series
data are challenging tasks in study of real-world complex systems, which demand
interpretable data representations to facilitate comprehension of both spatial
and temporal information within the original data space. Here, we proposed a
general and analytical ultralow-dimensionality reduction method for dynamical
systems named spatial-temporal principal component analysis (stPCA) to fully
represent the dynamics of a high-dimensional time-series by only a single
latent variable without distortion, which transforms high-dimensional spatial
information into one-dimensional temporal information based on nonlinear
delay-embedding theory. The dynamics of this single variable is analytically
solved and theoretically preserves the temporal property of original
high-dimensional time-series, thereby accurately and reliably identifying the
tipping point before an upcoming critical transition. Its applications to
real-world datasets such as individual-specific heterogeneous ICU records
demonstrated the effectiveness of stPCA, which quantitatively and robustly
provides the early-warning signals of the critical/tipping state on each
patient.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.12582v1,,False
