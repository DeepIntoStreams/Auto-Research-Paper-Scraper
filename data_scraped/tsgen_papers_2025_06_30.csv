Sheaf-Based Decentralized Multimodal Learning for Next-Generation Wireless Communication Systems,27/06/2025,"Abdulmomen Ghalkha, Zhuojun Tian, Chaouki Ben Issaid, Mehdi Bennis","In large-scale communication systems, increasingly complex scenarios require
more intelligent collaboration among edge devices collecting various multimodal
sensory data to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the environment
and improve decision-making accuracy. However, conventional federated learning
(FL) algorithms typically consider unimodal datasets, require identical model
architectures, and fail to leverage the rich information embedded in multimodal
data, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios with diverse
modalities and varying client capabilities. To address this issue, we propose
Sheaf-DMFL, a novel decentralized multimodal learning framework leveraging
sheaf theory to enhance collaboration among devices with diverse modalities.
Specifically, each client has a set of local feature encoders for its different
modalities, whose outputs are concatenated before passing through a
task-specific layer. While encoders for the same modality are trained
collaboratively across clients, we capture the intrinsic correlations among
clients' task-specific layers using a sheaf-based structure. To further enhance
learning capability, we propose an enhanced algorithm named Sheaf-DMFL-Att,
which tailors the attention mechanism within each client to capture
correlations among different modalities. A rigorous convergence analysis of
Sheaf-DMFL-Att is provided, establishing its theoretical guarantees. Extensive
simulations are conducted on real-world link blockage prediction and mmWave
beamforming scenarios, demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithms
in such heterogeneous wireless communication systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22374v1,,False
DiffSoundStream: Efficient Speech Tokenization via Diffusion Decoding,27/06/2025,"Yang Yang, Yunpeng Li, George Sung, Shao-Fu Shih, Craig Dooley, Alessio Centazzo, Ramanan Rajeswaran","Token-based language modeling is a prominent approach for speech generation,
where tokens are obtained by quantizing features from self-supervised learning
(SSL) models and extracting codes from neural speech codecs, generally referred
to as semantic tokens and acoustic tokens. These tokens are often modeled
autoregressively, with the inference speed being constrained by the token rate.
In this work, we propose DiffSoundStream, a solution that improves the
efficiency of speech tokenization in non-streaming scenarios through two
techniques: (1) conditioning the neural codec on semantic tokens to minimize
redundancy between semantic and acoustic tokens, and (2) leveraging latent
diffusion models to synthesize high-quality waveforms from semantic and
coarse-level acoustic tokens. Experiments show that at 50 tokens per second,
DiffSoundStream achieves speech quality on par with a standard SoundStream
model operating at twice the token rate. Additionally, we achieve step-size
distillation using just four diffusion sampling steps with only a minor quality
loss.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22362v1,,False
Robust quantum reservoir computers for forecasting chaotic dynamics: generalized synchronization and stability,27/06/2025,"Osama Ahmed, Felix Tennie, Luca Magri","We show that recurrent quantum reservoir computers (QRCs) and their
recurrence-free architectures (RF-QRCs) are robust tools for learning and
forecasting chaotic dynamics from time-series data. First, we formulate and
interpret quantum reservoir computers as coupled dynamical systems, where the
reservoir acts as a response system driven by training data; in other words,
quantum reservoir computers are generalized-synchronization (GS) systems.
Second, we show that quantum reservoir computers can learn chaotic dynamics and
their invariant properties, such as Lyapunov spectra, attractor dimensions, and
geometric properties such as the covariant Lyapunov vectors. This analysis is
enabled by deriving the Jacobian of the quantum reservoir update. Third, by
leveraging tools from generalized synchronization, we provide a method for
designing robust quantum reservoir computers. We propose the criterion
$GS=ESP$: GS implies the echo state property (ESP), and vice versa. We
analytically show that RF-QRCs, by design, fulfill $GS=ESP$. Finally, we
analyze the effect of simulated noise. We find that dissipation from noise
enhances the robustness of quantum reservoir computers. Numerical verifications
on systems of different dimensions support our conclusions. This work opens
opportunities for designing robust quantum machines for chaotic time series
forecasting on near-term quantum hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22335v1,,False
A Practical Approach to Power Saving in Hearables Using Sub-Nyquist Sampling with Bandwidth Extension,27/06/2025,"Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Anomadarshi Barua","Hearables are wearable computers that are worn on the ear. Bone conduction
microphones (BCMs) are used with air conduction microphones (ACMs) in hearables
as a supporting modality for multimodal speech enhancement (SE) in noisy
conditions. However, existing works don't consider the following practical
aspects for low-power implementations on hearables: (i) They do not explore how
lowering the sampling frequencies and bit resolutions in analog-to-digital
converters (ADCs) of hearables jointly impact low-power processing and
multimodal SE in terms of speech quality and intelligibility. (ii) They don't
discuss how GAN-like audio quality can be achieved without using actual GAN
discriminators. And (iii) They don't process signals from ACMs/BCMs at
sub-Nyquist sampling rate because, in their frameworks, they lack a wideband
reconstruction methodology from their narrowband parts. We propose SUBARU
(\textbf{Sub}-Nyquist \textbf{A}udio \textbf{R}esolution \textbf{U}psampling),
which achieves the following: SUBARU (i) intentionally uses sub-Nyquist
sampling and low bit resolution in ADCs, achieving a 3.31x reduction in power
consumption; (ii) introduces novel multi-scale and multi-period virtual
discriminators, which achieve GAN-like audio quality without using GANs'
adversarial training; and (iii) achieves streaming operations on mobile
platforms and SE in in-the-wild noisy conditions with an inference time of
1.74ms and a memory footprint of less than 13.77MB.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22321v1,,False
Unfolding Generative Flows with Koopman Operators: Fast and Interpretable Sampling,27/06/2025,"Erkan Turan, Aristotelis Siozopoulos, Maks Ovsjanikov","Conditional Flow Matching (CFM) offers a simulation-free framework for
training continuous-time generative models, bridging diffusion and flow-based
approaches. However, sampling from CFM still relies on numerically solving
non-linear ODEs which can be computationally expensive and difficult to
interpret. Recent alternatives address sampling speed via trajectory
straightening, mini-batch coupling or distillation. However, these methods
typically do not shed light on the underlying \textit{structure} of the
generative process. In this work, we propose to accelerate CFM and introduce an
interpretable representation of its dynamics by integrating Koopman operator
theory, which models non-linear flows as linear evolution in a learned space of
observables. We introduce a decoder-free Koopman-CFM architecture that learns
an embedding where the generative dynamics become linear, enabling closed-form,
one-step sampling via matrix exponentiation. This results in significant
speedups over traditional CFM as demonstrated on controlled 2D datasets and
real-world benchmarks, MNIST, Fashion-MNIST (F-MNIST), and the Toronto Face
Dataset (TFD). Unlike previous methods, our approach leads to a well-structured
Koopman generator, whose spectral properties, eigenvalues, and eigenfunctions
offer principled tools for analyzing generative behavior such as temporal
scaling, mode stability, and decomposition in Koopman latent space. By
combining sampling efficiency with analytical structure, Koopman-enhanced flow
matching offers a potential step toward fast and interpretable generative
modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22304v1,,False
RoomCraft: Controllable and Complete 3D Indoor Scene Generation,27/06/2025,"Mengqi Zhou, Xipeng Wang, Yuxi Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang","Generating realistic 3D indoor scenes from user inputs remains a challenging
problem in computer vision and graphics, requiring careful balance of geometric
consistency, spatial relationships, and visual realism. While neural generation
methods often produce repetitive elements due to limited global spatial
reasoning, procedural approaches can leverage constraints for controllable
generation but struggle with multi-constraint scenarios. When constraints
become numerous, object collisions frequently occur, forcing the removal of
furniture items and compromising layout completeness.
  To address these limitations, we propose RoomCraft, a multi-stage pipeline
that converts real images, sketches, or text descriptions into coherent 3D
indoor scenes. Our approach combines a scene generation pipeline with a
constraint-driven optimization framework. The pipeline first extracts
high-level scene information from user inputs and organizes it into a
structured format containing room type, furniture items, and spatial relations.
It then constructs a spatial relationship network to represent furniture
arrangements and generates an optimized placement sequence using a
heuristic-based depth-first search (HDFS) algorithm to ensure layout coherence.
To handle complex multi-constraint scenarios, we introduce a unified constraint
representation that processes both formal specifications and natural language
inputs, enabling flexible constraint-oriented adjustments through a
comprehensive action space design. Additionally, we propose a Conflict-Aware
Positioning Strategy (CAPS) that dynamically adjusts placement weights to
minimize furniture collisions and ensure layout completeness.
  Extensive experiments demonstrate that RoomCraft significantly outperforms
existing methods in generating realistic, semantically coherent, and visually
appealing room layouts across diverse input modalities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22291v1,,False
Hybrid Generative Modeling for Incomplete Physics: Deep Grey-Box Meets Optimal Transport,27/06/2025,"Gurjeet Sangra Singh, Maciej Falkiewicz, Alexandros Kalousis","Physics phenomena are often described by ordinary and/or partial differential
equations (ODEs/PDEs), and solved analytically or numerically. Unfortunately,
many real-world systems are described only approximately with missing or
unknown terms in the equations. This makes the distribution of the physics
model differ from the true data-generating process (DGP). Using limited and
unpaired data between DGP observations and the imperfect model simulations, we
investigate this particular setting by completing the known-physics model,
combining theory-driven models and data-driven to describe the shifted
distribution involved in the DGP. We present a novel hybrid generative model
approach combining deep grey-box modelling with Optimal Transport (OT) methods
to enhance incomplete physics models. Our method implements OT maps in data
space while maintaining minimal source distribution distortion, demonstrating
superior performance in resolving the unpaired problem and ensuring correct
usage of physics parameters. Unlike black-box alternatives, our approach
leverages physics-based inductive biases to accurately learn system dynamics
while preserving interpretability through its domain knowledge foundation.
Experimental results validate our method's effectiveness in both generation
tasks and model transparency, offering detailed insights into learned physics
dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22204v1,,False
Frequency-Semantic Enhanced Variational Autoencoder for Zero-Shot Skeleton-based Action Recognition,27/06/2025,"Wenhan Wu, Zhishuai Guo, Chen Chen, Hongfei Xue, Aidong Lu","Zero-shot skeleton-based action recognition aims to develop models capable of
identifying actions beyond the categories encountered during training. Previous
approaches have primarily focused on aligning visual and semantic
representations but often overlooked the importance of fine-grained action
patterns in the semantic space (e.g., the hand movements in drinking water and
brushing teeth). To address these limitations, we propose a Frequency-Semantic
Enhanced Variational Autoencoder (FS-VAE) to explore the skeleton semantic
representation learning with frequency decomposition. FS-VAE consists of three
key components: 1) a frequency-based enhancement module with high- and
low-frequency adjustments to enrich the skeletal semantics learning and improve
the robustness of zero-shot action recognition; 2) a semantic-based action
description with multilevel alignment to capture both local details and global
correspondence, effectively bridging the semantic gap and compensating for the
inherent loss of information in skeleton sequences; 3) a calibrated
cross-alignment loss that enables valid skeleton-text pairs to counterbalance
ambiguous ones, mitigating discrepancies and ambiguities in skeleton and text
features, thereby ensuring robust alignment. Evaluations on the benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, validating that
frequency-enhanced semantic features enable robust differentiation of visually
and semantically similar action clusters, improving zero-shot action
recognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22179v1,,False
ASVSim (AirSim for Surface Vehicles): A High-Fidelity Simulation Framework for Autonomous Surface Vehicle Research,27/06/2025,"Bavo Lesy, Siemen Herremans, Robin Kerstens, Jan Steckel, Walter Daems, Siegfried Mercelis, Ali Anwar","The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned
surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport.
These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is
especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green
Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same
time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of
autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source,
high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating
such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface
Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed
for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework
combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities,
including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic
datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents.
Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for
developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets.
The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep
learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the
potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an
open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation
research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22174v1,,False
UniCA: Adapting Time Series Foundation Model to General Covariate-Aware Forecasting,27/06/2025,"Lu Han, Yu Liu, Qiwen Deng, Jian Jiang, Yinbo Sun, Zhe Yu, Binfeng Wang, Xingyu Lu, Lintao Ma, Han-Jia Ye, De-Chuan Zhan","Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have achieved remarkable success
through large-scale pretraining. However, their design primarily targets
real-valued series, limiting their ability to handle general forecasting tasks
involving diverse and often heterogeneous covariates--such as categorical
variables and multimodal data (e.g., images, text)--which are typically
task-specific and difficult to leverage during pretraining. To address this
gap, we propose Unified Covariate Adaptation (UniCA), a framework to bridge
TSFMs with general covariate-aware forecasting. UniCA first performs covariate
homogenization to transform heterogeneous covariates into high-level
homogeneous series representations and then fuses them via a unified
attention-based fusion mechanism. UniCA is compatible and universal for
adaptation with both homogeneous and heterogeneous covariates, incorporating
extra covariate information while preserving the generalization ability of
TSFMs.Extensive experiments on multiple unimodal and multimodal covariate-aware
forecasting benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of UniCA, highlighting the
promise of covariate-aware TSFM adaptation in real-world forecasting scenarios.

AlphaBeta is not as good as you think: a new probabilistic model to better analyze deterministic game-solving algorithms,27/06/2025,"Raphaël Boige, Amine Boumaza, Bruno Scherrer","Deterministic game-solving algorithms are conventionally analyzed in the
light of their average-case complexity against a distribution of random
game-trees, where leaf values are independently sampled from a fixed
distribution. This simplified model enables uncluttered mathematical analysis,
revealing two key properties: root value distributions asymptotically collapse
to a single fixed value for finite-valued trees, and all reasonable algorithms
achieve global optimality. However, these findings are artifacts of the model's
design-its long criticized independence assumption strips games of structural
complexity, producing trivial instances where no algorithm faces meaningful
challenges. To address this limitation, we introduce a new probabilistic model
that incrementally constructs game-trees using a fixed level-wise conditional
distribution. By enforcing ancestor dependency, a critical structural feature
of real-world games, our framework generates problems with adjustable
difficulty while retaining some form of analytical tractability. For several
algorithms, including AlphaBeta and Scout, we derive recursive formulas
characterizing their average-case complexities under this model. These allow us
to rigorously compare algorithms on deep game-trees, where Monte-Carlo
simulations are no longer feasible. While asymptotically, all algorithms seem
to converge to identical branching factor (a result analogous to those of
independence-based models), deep finite trees reveal stark differences:
AlphaBeta incurs a significantly larger constant multiplicative factor compared
to algorithms like Scout, leading to a substantial practical slowdown. Our
framework sheds new light on classical game-solving algorithms, offering
rigorous evidence and analytical tools to advance the understanding of these
methods under a more realistic, challenging, and yet tractable model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21996v1,,False
Analyzing and Fine-Tuning Whisper Models for Multilingual Pilot Speech Transcription in the Cockpit,27/06/2025,"Kartheek Kumar Reddy Nareddy, Sarah Ternus, Julia Niebling","The developments in transformer encoder-decoder architectures have led to
significant breakthroughs in machine translation, Automatic Speech Recognition
(ASR), and instruction-based chat machines, among other applications. The
pre-trained models were trained on vast amounts of generic data over a few
epochs (fewer than five in most cases), resulting in their strong
generalization capabilities. Nevertheless, the performance of these models does
suffer when applied to niche domains like transcribing pilot speech in the
cockpit, which involves a lot of specific vocabulary and multilingual
conversations. This paper investigates and improves the transcription accuracy
of cockpit conversations with Whisper models. We have collected around 85
minutes of cockpit simulator recordings and 130 minutes of interview recordings
with pilots and manually labeled them. The speakers are middle aged men
speaking both German and English. To improve the accuracy of transcriptions, we
propose multiple normalization schemes to refine the transcripts and improve
Word Error Rate (WER). We then employ fine-tuning to enhance ASR performance,
utilizing performance-efficient fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA).
Hereby, WER decreased from 68.49 \% (pretrained whisper Large model without
normalization baseline) to 26.26\% (finetuned whisper Large model with the
proposed normalization scheme).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21990v1,,False
SceneDiffuser++: City-Scale Traffic Simulation via a Generative World Model,27/06/2025,"Shuhan Tan, John Lambert, Hong Jeon, Sakshum Kulshrestha, Yijing Bai, Jing Luo, Dragomir Anguelov, Mingxing Tan, Chiyu Max Jiang","The goal of traffic simulation is to augment a potentially limited amount of
manually-driven miles that is available for testing and validation, with a much
larger amount of simulated synthetic miles. The culmination of this vision
would be a generative simulated city, where given a map of the city and an
autonomous vehicle (AV) software stack, the simulator can seamlessly simulate
the trip from point A to point B by populating the city around the AV and
controlling all aspects of the scene, from animating the dynamic agents (e.g.,
vehicles, pedestrians) to controlling the traffic light states. We refer to
this vision as CitySim, which requires an agglomeration of simulation
technologies: scene generation to populate the initial scene, agent behavior
modeling to animate the scene, occlusion reasoning, dynamic scene generation to
seamlessly spawn and remove agents, and environment simulation for factors such
as traffic lights. While some key technologies have been separately studied in
various works, others such as dynamic scene generation and environment
simulation have received less attention in the research community. We propose
SceneDiffuser++, the first end-to-end generative world model trained on a
single loss function capable of point A-to-B simulation on a city scale
integrating all the requirements above. We demonstrate the city-scale traffic
simulation capability of SceneDiffuser++ and study its superior realism under
long simulation conditions. We evaluate the simulation quality on an augmented
version of the Waymo Open Motion Dataset (WOMD) with larger map regions to
support trip-level simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21976v1,,False
Optimal Return-to-Go Guided Decision Transformer for Auto-Bidding in Advertisement,27/06/2025,"Hao Jiang, Yongxiang Tang, Yanxiang Zeng, Pengjia Yuan, Yanhua Cheng, Teng Sha, Xialong Liu, Peng Jiang","In the realm of online advertising, advertisers partake in ad auctions to
obtain advertising slots, frequently taking advantage of auto-bidding tools
provided by demand-side platforms. To improve the automation of these bidding
systems, we adopt generative models, namely the Decision Transformer (DT), to
tackle the difficulties inherent in automated bidding. Applying the Decision
Transformer to the auto-bidding task enables a unified approach to sequential
modeling, which efficiently overcomes short-sightedness by capturing long-term
dependencies between past bidding actions and user behavior. Nevertheless,
conventional DT has certain drawbacks: (1) DT necessitates a preset
return-to-go (RTG) value before generating actions, which is not inherently
produced; (2) The policy learned by DT is restricted by its training data,
which is consists of mixed-quality trajectories. To address these challenges,
we introduce the R* Decision Transformer (R* DT), developed in a three-step
process: (1) R DT: Similar to traditional DT, R DT stores actions based on
state and RTG value, as well as memorizing the RTG for a given state using the
training set; (2) R^ DT: We forecast the highest value (within the training
set) of RTG for a given state, deriving a suboptimal policy based on the
current state and the forecasted supreme RTG value; (3) R* DT: Based on R^ DT,
we generate trajectories and select those with high rewards (using a simulator)
to augment our training dataset. This data enhancement has been shown to
improve the RTG of trajectories in the training data and gradually leads the
suboptimal policy towards optimality. Comprehensive tests on a publicly
available bidding dataset validate the R* DT's efficacy and highlight its
superiority when dealing with mixed-quality trajectories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21956v1,10.1145/3701716.3715564,False
Universal Modelling of Autocovariance Functions via Spline Kernels,27/06/2025,Lachlan Astfalck,"Flexible modelling of the autocovariance function (ACF) is central to
time-series, spatial, and spatio-temporal analysis. Modern applications often
demand flexibility beyond classical parametric models, motivating
non-parametric descriptions of the ACF. Bochner's Theorem guarantees that any
positive spectral measure yields a valid ACF via the inverse Fourier transform;
however, existing non-parametric approaches in the spectral domain rarely
return closed-form expressions for the ACF itself. We develop a flexible,
closed-form class of non-parametric ACFs by deriving the inverse Fourier
transform of B-spline spectral bases with arbitrary degree and knot placement.
This yields a general class of ACF with three key features: (i) it is provably
dense, under an $L^1$ metric, in the space of weakly stationary, mean-square
continuous ACFs with mild regularity conditions; (ii) it accommodates
univariate, multivariate, and multidimensional processes; and (iii) it
naturally supports non-separable structure without requiring explicit
imposition. Jackson-type approximation bounds establish convergence rates, and
empirical results on simulated and real-world data demonstrate accurate process
recovery. The method provides a practical and theoretically grounded approach
for constructing a non-parametric class of ACF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21953v1,,False
Physics-informed network paradigm with data generation and background noise removal for diverse distributed acoustic sensing applications,27/06/2025,"Yangyang Wan, Haotian Wang, Xuhui Yu, Jiageng Chen, Xinyu Fan, Zuyuan He","Distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) has attracted considerable attention
across various fields and artificial intelligence (AI) technology plays an
important role in DAS applications to realize event recognition and denoising.
Existing AI models require real-world data (RWD), whether labeled or not, for
training, which is contradictory to the fact of limited available event data in
real-world scenarios. Here, a physics-informed DAS neural network paradigm is
proposed, which does not need real-world events data for training. By
physically modeling target events and the constraints of real world and DAS
system, physical functions are derived to train a generative network for
generation of DAS events data. DAS debackground net is trained by using the
generated DAS events data to eliminate background noise in DAS data. The
effectiveness of the proposed paradigm is verified in event identification
application based on a public dataset of DAS spatiotemporal data and in belt
conveyor fault monitoring application based on DAS time-frequency data, and
achieved comparable or better performance than data-driven networks trained
with RWD. Owing to the introduction of physical information and capability of
background noise removal, the paradigm demonstrates generalization in same
application on different sites. A fault diagnosis accuracy of 91.8% is achieved
in belt conveyor field with networks which transferred from simulation test
site without any fault events data of test site and field for training. The

Joint Task Offloading and Resource Allocation in Low-Altitude MEC via Graph Attention Diffusion,27/06/2025,"Yifan Xue, Ruihuai Liang, Bo Yang, Xuelin Cao, Zhiwen Yu, Mérouane Debbah, Chau Yuen","With the rapid development of the low-altitude economy, air-ground integrated
multi-access edge computing (MEC) systems are facing increasing demands for
real-time and intelligent task scheduling. In such systems, task offloading and
resource allocation encounter multiple challenges, including node
heterogeneity, unstable communication links, and dynamic task variations. To
address these issues, this paper constructs a three-layer heterogeneous MEC
system architecture for low-altitude economic networks, encompassing aerial and
ground users as well as edge servers. The system is systematically modeled from
the perspectives of communication channels, computational costs, and constraint
conditions, and the joint optimization problem of offloading decisions and
resource allocation is uniformly abstracted into a graph-structured modeling
task. On this basis, we propose a graph attention diffusion-based solution
generator (GADSG). This method integrates the contextual awareness of graph
attention networks with the solution distribution learning capability of
diffusion models, enabling joint modeling and optimization of discrete
offloading variables and continuous resource allocation variables within a
high-dimensional latent space. We construct multiple simulation datasets with
varying scales and topologies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the
