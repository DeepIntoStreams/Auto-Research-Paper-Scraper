VaViM and VaVAM: Autonomous Driving through Video Generative Modeling,21/02/2025,"Florent Bartoccioni, Elias Ramzi, Victor Besnier, Shashanka Venkataramanan, Tuan-Hung Vu, Yihong Xu, Loick Chambon, Spyros Gidaris, Serkan Odabas, David Hurych, Renaud Marlet, Alexandre Boulch, Mickael Chen, Ã‰loi Zablocki, Andrei Bursuc, Eduardo Valle, Matthieu Cord","We explore the potential of large-scale generative video models for
autonomous driving, introducing an open-source auto-regressive video model
(VaViM) and its companion video-action model (VaVAM) to investigate how video
pre-training transfers to real-world driving. VaViM is a simple auto-regressive
video model that predicts frames using spatio-temporal token sequences. We show
that it captures the semantics and dynamics of driving scenes. VaVAM, the
video-action model, leverages the learned representations of VaViM to generate
driving trajectories through imitation learning. Together, the models form a
complete perception-to-action pipeline. We evaluate our models in open- and
closed-loop driving scenarios, revealing that video-based pre-training holds
promise for autonomous driving. Key insights include the semantic richness of
the learned representations, the benefits of scaling for video synthesis, and
the complex relationship between model size, data, and safety metrics in
closed-loop evaluations. We release code and model weights at

Automating Curriculum Learning for Reinforcement Learning using a Skill-Based Bayesian Network,21/02/2025,"Vincent Hsiao, Mark Roberts, Laura M. Hiatt, George Konidaris, Dana Nau","A major challenge for reinforcement learning is automatically generating
curricula to reduce training time or improve performance in some target task.
We introduce SEBNs (Skill-Environment Bayesian Networks) which model a
probabilistic relationship between a set of skills, a set of goals that relate
to the reward structure, and a set of environment features to predict policy
performance on (possibly unseen) tasks. We develop an algorithm that uses the
inferred estimates of agent success from SEBN to weigh the possible next tasks
by expected improvement. We evaluate the benefit of the resulting curriculum on
three environments: a discrete gridworld, continuous control, and simulated
robotics. The results show that curricula constructed using SEBN frequently
outperform other baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15662v1,,False
Mantis: Lightweight Calibrated Foundation Model for User-Friendly Time Series Classification,21/02/2025,"Vasilii Feofanov, Songkang Wen, Marius Alonso, Romain Ilbert, Hongbo Guo, Malik Tiomoko, Lujia Pan, Jianfeng Zhang, Ievgen Redko","In recent years, there has been increasing interest in developing foundation
models for time series data that can generalize across diverse downstream
tasks. While numerous forecasting-oriented foundation models have been
introduced, there is a notable scarcity of models tailored for time series
classification. To address this gap, we present Mantis, a new open-source
foundation model for time series classification based on the Vision Transformer
(ViT) architecture that has been pre-trained using a contrastive learning
approach. Our experimental results show that Mantis outperforms existing
foundation models both when the backbone is frozen and when fine-tuned, while
achieving the lowest calibration error. In addition, we propose several
adapters to handle the multivariate setting, reducing memory requirements and
modeling channel interdependence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15637v1,,False
Enhancing RWKV-based Language Models for Long-Sequence Text Generation,21/02/2025,Xinghan Pan,"This paper presents an enhanced RWKV-based language generation model designed
to improve long-sequence text processing. We propose an adaptive token shift
and gating mechanism to better capture long-range dependencies in text
generation. Through a series of experiments, we compare the baseline RWKV model
with the enhanced model, evaluating performance in terms of forward propagation
time, text generation quality, and automatic evaluation metrics such as
perplexity, BLEU, and ROUGE. Experimental results show that the enhanced model
significantly improves generation quality, especially in BLEU and ROUGE scores,
and demonstrates stronger context-capturing ability in long-text generation
tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15485v1,,False
Decoding for Punctured Convolutional and Turbo Codes: A Deep Learning Solution for Protocols Compliance,21/02/2025,"Yongli Yan, Linglong Dai","Neural network-based decoding methods have shown promise in enhancing error
correction performance, but traditional approaches struggle with the challenges
posed by punctured codes. In particular, these methods fail to address the
complexities of variable code rates and the need for protocol compatibility.
This paper presents a unified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based decoding
architecture specifically designed to overcome these challenges. The proposed
method unifies punctured convolutional and Turbo codes. A puncture embedding
mechanism integrates puncturing patterns directly into the network, enabling
seamless adaptation to varying code rates, while balanced bit error rate
training ensures robustness across different code lengths, rates, and channels,
maintaining protocol flexibility. Extensive simulations in Additive White
Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed
approach outperforms conventional decoding techniques, providing significant
improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness. These results underscore the
potential of LSTM-based decoding as a promising solution for next-generation
artificial intelligence powered communication systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15475v1,,False
Mitigating Data Scarcity in Time Series Analysis: A Foundation Model with Series-Symbol Data Generation,21/02/2025,"Wenxuan Wang, Kai Wu, Yujian Betterest Li, Dan Wang, Xiaoyu Zhang, Jing Liu","Foundation models for time series analysis (TSA) have attracted significant
attention. However, challenges such as data scarcity and data imbalance
continue to hinder their development. To address this, we consider modeling
complex systems through symbolic expressions that serve as semantic descriptors
of time series. Building on this concept, we introduce a series-symbol (S2)
dual-modulity data generation mechanism, enabling the unrestricted creation of
high-quality time series data paired with corresponding symbolic
representations. Leveraging the S2 dataset, we develop SymTime, a pre-trained
foundation model for TSA. SymTime demonstrates competitive performance across
five major TSA tasks when fine-tuned with downstream task, rivaling foundation
models pre-trained on real-world datasets. This approach underscores the
potential of dual-modality data generation and pretraining mechanisms in
overcoming data scarcity and enhancing task performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15466v1,,False
"Exploring Embodied Multimodal Large Models: Development, Datasets, and Future Directions",21/02/2025,"Shoubin Chen, Zehao Wu, Kai Zhang, Chunyu Li, Baiyang Zhang, Fei Ma, Fei Richard Yu, Qingquan Li","Embodied multimodal large models (EMLMs) have gained significant attention in
recent years due to their potential to bridge the gap between perception,
cognition, and action in complex, real-world environments. This comprehensive
review explores the development of such models, including Large Language Models
(LLMs), Large Vision Models (LVMs), and other models, while also examining
other emerging architectures. We discuss the evolution of EMLMs, with a focus
on embodied perception, navigation, interaction, and simulation. Furthermore,
the review provides a detailed analysis of the datasets used for training and
evaluating these models, highlighting the importance of diverse, high-quality
data for effective learning. The paper also identifies key challenges faced by
EMLMs, including issues of scalability, generalization, and real-time
decision-making. Finally, we outline future directions, emphasizing the
integration of multimodal sensing, reasoning, and action to advance the
development of increasingly autonomous systems. By providing an in-depth
analysis of state-of-the-art methods and identifying critical gaps, this paper
aims to inspire future advancements in EMLMs and their applications across
diverse domains.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15336v1,,False
Utilizing Sequential Information of General Lab-test Results and Diagnoses History for Differential Diagnosis of Dementia,21/02/2025,"Yizong Xing, Dhita Putri Pratama, Yuke Wang, Yufan Zhang, Brian E. Chapman","Early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) faces multiple data-related
challenges, including high variability in patient data, limited access to
specialized diagnostic tests, and overreliance on single-type indicators. These
challenges are exacerbated by the progressive nature of AD, where subtle
pathophysiological changes often precede clinical symptoms by decades. To
address these limitations, this study proposes a novel approach that takes
advantage of routinely collected general laboratory test histories for the
early detection and differential diagnosis of AD. By modeling lab test
sequences as ""sentences"", we apply word embedding techniques to capture latent
relationships between tests and employ deep time series models, including
long-short-term memory (LSTM) and Transformer networks, to model temporal
patterns in patient records. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
improves diagnostic accuracy and enables scalable and costeffective AD
screening in diverse clinical settings.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15317v1,,False
Comparative Analysis of Black Hole Mass Estimation in Type-2 AGNs: Classical vs. Quantum Machine Learning and Deep Learning Approaches,21/02/2025,"Sathwik Narkedimilli, Venkata Sriram Amballa, N V Saran Kumar, R Arun Kumar, R Praneeth Reddy, Satvik Raghav, Manish M, Aswath Babu H","In the case of Type-2 AGNs, estimating the mass of the black hole is
challenging. Understanding how galaxies form and evolve requires considerable
insight into the mass of black holes. This work compared different classical
and quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms for black hole mass estimation,
wherein the classical algorithms are Linear Regression, XGBoost Regression,
Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor (SVR), Lasso Regression,
Ridge Regression, Elastic Net Regression, Bayesian Regression, Decision Tree
Regressor, Gradient Booster Regressor, Classical Neural Networks, Gated
Recurrent Unit (GRU), LSTM, Deep Residual Networks (ResNets) and
Transformer-Based Regression. On the other hand, quantum algorithms including
Hybrid Quantum Neural Networks (QNN), Quantum Long Short-Term Memory (Q-LSTM),
Sampler-QNN, Estimator-QNN, Variational Quantum Regressor (VQR), Quantum Linear
Regression(Q-LR), QML with JAX optimization were also tested. The results
revealed that classical algorithms gave better R^2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE results
than the quantum models. Among the classical models, LSTM has the best result
with an accuracy of 99.77%. Estimator-QNN has the highest accuracy for quantum
algorithms with an MSE of 0.0124 and an accuracy of 99.75%. This study
ascertains both the strengths and weaknesses of the classical and the quantum
approaches. As far as our knowledge goes, this work could pave the way for the
future application of quantum algorithms in astrophysical data analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15297v1,,False
Beyond Fixed Variables: Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting via Flat Scheme and Spatio-temporal Focal Learning,21/02/2025,"Minbo Ma, Kai Tang, Huan Li, Fei Teng, Dalin Zhang, Tianrui Li","Multivariate Time Series Forecasting (MTSF) has long been a key research
focus. Traditionally, these studies assume a fixed number of variables, but in
real-world applications, Cyber-Physical Systems often expand as new sensors are
deployed, increasing variables in MTSF. In light of this, we introduce a novel
task, Expanding-variate Time Series Forecasting (EVTSF). This task presents
unique challenges, specifically (1) handling inconsistent data shapes caused by
adding new variables, and (2) addressing imbalanced spatio-temporal learning,
where expanding variables have limited observed data due to the necessity for
timely operation. To address these challenges, we propose STEV, a flexible
spatio-temporal forecasting framework. STEV includes a new Flat Scheme to
tackle the inconsistent data shape issue, which extends the graph-based
spatio-temporal modeling architecture into 1D space by flattening the 2D
samples along the variable dimension, making the model variable-scale-agnostic
while still preserving dynamic spatial correlations through a holistic graph.
We introduce a novel Spatio-temporal Focal Learning strategy that incorporates
a negative filter to resolve potential conflicts between contrastive learning
and graph representation, and a focal contrastive loss as its core to guide the
framework to focus on optimizing the expanding variables. We benchmark EVTSF
performance using three real-world datasets and compare it against three
potential solutions employing SOTA MTSF models tailored for EVSTF. Experimental
results show that STEV significantly outperforms its competitors, particularly
on expanding variables. Notably, STEV, with only 5% of observations from the
expanding period, is on par with SOTA MTSF models trained with complete
observations. Further exploration of various expanding strategies underscores
the generalizability of STEV in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15296v1,,False
CopyJudge: Automated Copyright Infringement Identification and Mitigation in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,21/02/2025,"Shunchang Liu, Zhuan Shi, Lingjuan Lyu, Yaochu Jin, Boi Faltings","Assessing whether AI-generated images are substantially similar to
copyrighted works is a crucial step in resolving copyright disputes. In this
paper, we propose CopyJudge, an automated copyright infringement identification
framework that leverages large vision-language models (LVLMs) to simulate
practical court processes for determining substantial similarity between
copyrighted images and those generated by text-to-image diffusion models.
Specifically, we employ an abstraction-filtration-comparison test framework
with multi-LVLM debate to assess the likelihood of infringement and provide
detailed judgment rationales. Based on the judgments, we further introduce a
general LVLM-based mitigation strategy that automatically optimizes infringing
prompts by avoiding sensitive expressions while preserving the non-infringing
content. Besides, our approach can be enhanced by exploring non-infringing
noise vectors within the diffusion latent space via reinforcement learning,
even without modifying the original prompts. Experimental results show that our
identification method achieves comparable state-of-the-art performance, while
offering superior generalization and interpretability across various forms of
infringement, and that our mitigation method could more effectively mitigate
memorization and IP infringement without losing non-infringing expressions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15278v1,,False
Multi-agent Multi-armed Bandits with Minimum Reward Guarantee Fairness,21/02/2025,"Piyushi Manupriya, Himanshu, SakethaNath Jagarlapudi, Ganesh Ghalme","We investigate the problem of maximizing social welfare while ensuring
fairness in a multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MA-MAB) setting. In this problem,
a centralized decision-maker takes actions over time, generating random rewards
for various agents. Our goal is to maximize the sum of expected cumulative
rewards, a.k.a. social welfare, while ensuring that each agent receives an
expected reward that is at least a constant fraction of the maximum possible
expected reward.
  Our proposed algorithm, RewardFairUCB, leverages the Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) technique to achieve sublinear regret bounds for both fairness and social
welfare. The fairness regret measures the positive difference between the
minimum reward guarantee and the expected reward of a given policy, whereas the
social welfare regret measures the difference between the social welfare of the
optimal fair policy and that of the given policy.
  We show that RewardFairUCB algorithm achieves instance-independent social
welfare regret guarantees of $\tilde{O}(T^{1/2})$ and a fairness regret upper
bound of $\tilde{O}(T^{3/4})$. We also give the lower bound of
$\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ for both social welfare and fairness regret. We evaluate
RewardFairUCB's performance against various baseline and heuristic algorithms
using simulated data and real world data, highlighting trade-offs between
fairness and social welfare regrets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15240v1,,False
