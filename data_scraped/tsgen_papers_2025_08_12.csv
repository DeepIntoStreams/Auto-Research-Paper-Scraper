Optimal Fees for Liquidity Provision in Automated Market Makers,11/08/2025,"Steven Campbell, Philippe Bergault, Jason Milionis, Marcel Nutz","Passive liquidity providers (LPs) in automated market makers (AMMs) face
losses due to adverse selection (LVR), which static trading fees often fail to
offset in practice. We study the key determinants of LP profitability in a
dynamic reduced-form model where an AMM operates in parallel with a centralized
exchange (CEX), traders route their orders optimally to the venue offering the
better price, and arbitrageurs exploit price discrepancies. Using large-scale
simulations and real market data, we analyze how LP profits vary with market
conditions such as volatility and trading volume, and characterize the optimal
AMM fee as a function of these conditions. We highlight the mechanisms driving
these relationships through extensive comparative statics, and confirm the
model's relevance through market data calibration. A key trade-off emerges:
fees must be low enough to attract volume, yet high enough to earn sufficient
revenues and mitigate arbitrage losses. We find that under normal market
conditions, the optimal AMM fee is competitive with the trading cost on the CEX
and remarkably stable, whereas in periods of very high volatility, a high fee
protects passive LPs from severe losses. These findings suggest that a
threshold-type dynamic fee schedule is both robust enough to market conditions
and improves LP outcomes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08152v1,,False
MuaLLM: A Multimodal Large Language Model Agent for Circuit Design Assistance with Hybrid Contextual Retrieval-Augmented Generation,11/08/2025,"Pravallika Abbineni, Saoud Aldowaish, Colin Liechty, Soroosh Noorzad, Ali Ghazizadeh, Morteza Fayazi","Conducting a comprehensive literature review is crucial for advancing circuit
design methodologies. However, the rapid influx of state-of-the-art research,
inconsistent data representation, and the complexity of optimizing circuit
design objectives make this task significantly challenging. In this paper, we
propose MuaLLM, an open-source multimodal Large Language Model (LLM) agent for
circuit design assistance that integrates a hybrid Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) framework with an adaptive vector database of circuit design
research papers. Unlike conventional LLMs, the MuaLLM agent employs a Reason +
Act (ReAct) workflow for iterative reasoning, goal-setting, and multi-step
information retrieval. It functions as a question-answering design assistant,
capable of interpreting complex queries and providing reasoned responses
grounded in circuit literature. Its multimodal capabilities enable processing
of both textual and visual data, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive
analysis. The system dynamically adapts using intelligent search tools,
automated document retrieval from the internet, and real-time database updates.
Unlike conventional approaches constrained by model context limits, MuaLLM
decouples retrieval from inference, enabling scalable reasoning over
arbitrarily large corpora. At the maximum context length supported by standard
LLMs, MuaLLM remains up to 10x less costly and 1.6x faster while maintaining
the same accuracy. This allows rapid, no-human-in-the-loop database generation,
overcoming the bottleneck of simulation-based dataset creation for circuits. To
evaluate MuaLLM, we introduce two custom datasets: RAG-250, targeting retrieval
and citation performance, and Reasoning-100 (Reas-100), focused on multistep
reasoning in circuit design. MuaLLM achieves 90.1% recall on RAG-250, and 86.8%
accuracy on Reas-100.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08137v1,,False
MemoryKT: An Integrative Memory-and-Forgetting Method for Knowledge Tracing,11/08/2025,"Mingrong Lin, Ke Deng, Zhengyang Wu, Zetao Zheng, Jie Li","Knowledge Tracing (KT) is committed to capturing students' knowledge mastery
from their historical interactions. Simulating students' memory states is a
promising approach to enhance both the performance and interpretability of
knowledge tracing models. Memory consists of three fundamental processes:
encoding, storage, and retrieval. Although forgetting primarily manifests
during the storage stage, most existing studies rely on a single,
undifferentiated forgetting mechanism, overlooking other memory processes as
well as personalized forgetting patterns. To address this, this paper proposes
memoryKT, a knowledge tracing model based on a novel temporal variational
autoencoder. The model simulates memory dynamics through a three-stage process:
(i) Learning the distribution of students' knowledge memory features, (ii)
Reconstructing their exercise feedback, while (iii) Embedding a personalized
forgetting module within the temporal workflow to dynamically modulate memory
storage strength. This jointly models the complete encoding-storage-retrieval
cycle, significantly enhancing the model's perception capability for individual
differences. Extensive experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our
proposed approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08122v1,,False
AdaptFlow: Adaptive Workflow Optimization via Meta-Learning,11/08/2025,"Runchuan Zhu, Bowen Jiang, Lingrui Mei, Fangkai Yang, Lu Wang, Haoxiang Gao, Fengshuo Bai, Pu Zhao, Qingwei Lin, Saravan Rajmohan, Dongmei Zhang","Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest
in agentic workflows, which are structured sequences of LLM invocations
intended to solve complex tasks. However, existing approaches often rely on
static templates or manually designed workflows, which limit adaptability to
diverse tasks and hinder scalability. We propose AdaptFlow, a natural
language-based meta-learning framework inspired by model-agnostic meta-learning
(MAML). AdaptFlow learns a generalizable workflow initialization that enables
rapid subtask-level adaptation. It employs a bi-level optimization scheme: the
inner loop refines the workflow for a specific subtask using LLM-generated
feedback, while the outer loop updates the shared initialization to perform
well across tasks. This setup allows AdaptFlow to generalize effectively to
unseen tasks by adapting the initialized workflow through language-guided
modifications. Evaluated across question answering, code generation, and
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AdaptFlow consistently outperforms both
manually crafted and automatically searched baselines, achieving
state-of-the-art results with strong generalization across tasks and models.

Adaptive Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communications,11/08/2025,"Dongxu Li, Kai Yuan, Jianhao Huang, Chuan Huang, Xiaoqi Qin, Shuguang Cui, Ping Zhang","Semantic communications (SemComs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for
joint data and task-oriented transmissions, combining the demands for both the
bit-accurate delivery and end-to-end (E2E) distortion minimization. However,
current joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in SemComs is not compatible with
the existing communication systems and cannot adapt to the variations of the
sources or the channels, while separate source-channel coding (SSCC) is
suboptimal in the finite blocklength regime. To address these issues, we
propose an adaptive source-channel coding (ASCC) scheme for SemComs over
parallel Gaussian channels, where the deep neural network (DNN)-based semantic
source coding and conventional digital channel coding are separately deployed
and adaptively designed. To enable efficient adaptation between the source and
channel coding, we first approximate the E2E data and semantic distortions as
functions of source coding rate and bit error ratio (BER) via logistic
regression, where BER is further modeled as functions of signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR) and channel coding rate. Then, we formulate the weighted sum E2E
distortion minimization problem for joint source-channel coding rate and power
allocation over parallel channels, which is solved by the successive convex
approximation. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ASCC
scheme outperforms typical deep JSCC and SSCC schemes for both the single- and
parallel-channel scenarios while maintaining full compatibility with practical
digital systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07958v1,,False
Frequency-Domain Analysis of Time-Dependent Multiomic Data in Progressive Neurodegenerative Diseases: A Proposed Quantum-Classical Hybrid Approach with Quaternionic Extensions,11/08/2025,John D. Mayfield M. D. Ph. D. M. Sc,"Progressive neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease (AD),
multiple sclerosis (MS), Parkinson's disease (PD), and amyotrophic lateral
sclerosis (ALS), exhibit complex, nonlinear trajectories that challenge
deterministic modeling. Traditional time-domain analyses of multiomic and
neuroimaging data often fail to capture hidden oscillatory patterns, limiting
predictive accuracy. We propose a theoretical mathematical framework that
transforms time-series data into frequency or s-domain using Fourier and
Laplace transforms, models neuronal dynamics via Hamiltonian formulations, and
employs quantum-classical hybrid computing with variational quantum
eigensolvers (VQE) for enhanced pattern detection. This theoretical construct
serves as a foundation for future empirical works in quantum-enhanced analysis
of neurodegenerative diseases. We extend this to quaternionic representations
with three imaginary axes ($i, j, k$) to model multistate Hamiltonians in
multifaceted disorders, drawing from quantum neuromorphic computing to capture
entangled neural dynamics \citep{Pehle2020, Emani2019}. This approach leverages
quantum advantages in handling high-dimensional amplitude-phase data, enabling
outlier detection and frequency signature analysis. Potential clinical
applications include identifying high-risk patients with rapid progression or
therapy resistance using s-domain biomarkers, supported by quantum machine
learning (QML) precedents achieving up to 99.89% accuracy in Alzheimer's
classification \citep{Belay2024, Bhowmik2025}. This framework aims to lay the
groundwork for redefining precision medicine for neurodegenerative diseases
through future validations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07948v1,,False
Not Yet AlphaFold for the Mind: Evaluating Centaur as a Synthetic Participant,11/08/2025,"Sabrina Namazova, Alessandra Brondetta, Younes Strittmatter, Matthew Nassar, Sebastian Musslick","Simulators have revolutionized scientific practice across the natural
sciences. By generating data that reliably approximate real-world phenomena,
they enable scientists to accelerate hypothesis testing and optimize
experimental designs. This is perhaps best illustrated by AlphaFold, a
Nobel-prize winning simulator in chemistry that predicts protein structures
from amino acid sequences, enabling rapid prototyping of molecular
interactions, drug targets, and protein functions. In the behavioral sciences,
a reliable participant simulator - a system capable of producing human-like
behavior across cognitive tasks - would represent a similarly transformative
advance. Recently, Binz et al. introduced Centaur, a large language model (LLM)
fine-tuned on human data from 160 experiments, proposing its use not only as a
model of cognition but also as a participant simulator for ""in silico
prototyping of experimental studies"", e.g., to advance automated cognitive
science. Here, we review the core criteria for a participant simulator and
assess how well Centaur meets them. Although Centaur demonstrates strong
predictive accuracy, its generative behavior - a critical criterion for a
participant simulator - systematically diverges from human data. This suggests
that, while Centaur is a significant step toward predicting human behavior, it
does not yet meet the standards of a reliable participant simulator or an
accurate model of cognition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07887v1,,False
Stochastic dynamics learning with state-space systems,11/08/2025,"Juan-Pablo Ortega, Florian Rossmannek","This work advances the theoretical foundations of reservoir computing (RC) by
providing a unified treatment of fading memory and the echo state property
(ESP) in both deterministic and stochastic settings. We investigate state-space
systems, a central model class in time series learning, and establish that
fading memory and solution stability hold generically -- even in the absence of
the ESP -- offering a robust explanation for the empirical success of RC models
without strict contractivity conditions. In the stochastic case, we critically
assess stochastic echo states, proposing a novel distributional perspective
rooted in attractor dynamics on the space of probability distributions, which
leads to a rich and coherent theory. Our results extend and generalize previous
work on non-autonomous dynamical systems, offering new insights into causality,
stability, and memory in RC models. This lays the groundwork for reliable
generative modeling of temporal data in both deterministic and stochastic
regimes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07876v1,,False
Being-M0.5: A Real-Time Controllable Vision-Language-Motion Model,11/08/2025,"Bin Cao, Sipeng Zheng, Ye Wang, Lujie Xia, Qianshan Wei, Qin Jin, Jing Liu, Zongqing Lu","Human motion generation has emerged as a critical technology with
transformative potential for real-world applications. However, existing
vision-language-motion models (VLMMs) face significant limitations that hinder
their practical deployment. We identify controllability as a main bottleneck,
manifesting in five key aspects: inadequate response to diverse human commands,
limited pose initialization capabilities, poor performance on long-term
sequences, insufficient handling of unseen scenarios, and lack of fine-grained
control over individual body parts. To overcome these limitations, we present
Being-M0.5, the first real-time, controllable VLMM that achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple motion generation tasks. Our
approach is built upon HuMo100M, the largest and most comprehensive human
motion dataset to date, comprising over 5 million self-collected motion
sequences, 100 million multi-task instructional instances, and detailed
part-level annotations that address a critical gap in existing datasets. We
introduce a novel part-aware residual quantization technique for motion
tokenization that enables precise, granular control over individual body parts
during generation. Extensive experimental validation demonstrates Being-M0.5's
superior performance across diverse motion benchmarks, while comprehensive
efficiency analysis confirms its real-time capabilities. Our contributions
include design insights and detailed computational analysis to guide future
development of practical motion generators. We believe that HuMo100M and
Being-M0.5 represent significant advances that will accelerate the adoption of
motion generation technologies in real-world applications. The project page is

DETACH: Cross-domain Learning for Long-Horizon Tasks via Mixture of Disentangled Experts,11/08/2025,"Yutong Shen, Hangxu Liu, Penghui Liu, Ruizhe Xia, Tianyi Yao, Yitong Sun, Tongtong Feng","Long-Horizon (LH) tasks in Human-Scene Interaction (HSI) are complex
multi-step tasks that require continuous planning, sequential decision-making,
and extended execution across domains to achieve the final goal. However,
existing methods heavily rely on skill chaining by concatenating pre-trained
subtasks, with environment observations and self-state tightly coupled, lacking
the ability to generalize to new combinations of environments and skills,
failing to complete various LH tasks across domains. To solve this problem,
this paper presents DETACH, a cross-domain learning framework for LH tasks via
biologically inspired dual-stream disentanglement. Inspired by the brain's
""where-what"" dual pathway mechanism, DETACH comprises two core modules: i) an
environment learning module for spatial understanding, which captures object
functions, spatial relationships, and scene semantics, achieving cross-domain
transfer through complete environment-self disentanglement; ii) a skill
learning module for task execution, which processes self-state information
including joint degrees of freedom and motor patterns, enabling cross-skill
transfer through independent motor pattern encoding. We conducted extensive
experiments on various LH tasks in HSI scenes. Compared with existing methods,
DETACH can achieve an average subtasks success rate improvement of 23% and
average execution efficiency improvement of 29%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07842v1,,False
Learning Satellite Attitude Dynamics with Physics-Informed Normalising Flow,11/08/2025,"Carlo Cena, Mauro Martini, Marcello Chiaberge","Attitude control is a fundamental aspect of spacecraft operations. Model
Predictive Control (MPC) has emerged as a powerful strategy for these tasks,
relying on accurate models of the system dynamics to optimize control actions
over a prediction horizon. In scenarios where physics models are incomplete,
difficult to derive, or computationally expensive, machine learning offers a
flexible alternative by learning the system behavior directly from data.
However, purely data-driven models often struggle with generalization and
stability, especially when applied to inputs outside their training domain. To
address these limitations, we investigate the benefits of incorporating
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) into the learning of spacecraft
attitude dynamics, comparing their performance with that of purely data-driven
approaches. Using a Real-valued Non-Volume Preserving (Real NVP) neural network
architecture with a self-attention mechanism, we trained several models on
simulated data generated with the Basilisk simulator. Two training strategies
were considered: a purely data-driven baseline and a physics-informed variant
to improve robustness and stability. Our results demonstrate that the inclusion
of physics-based information significantly enhances the performance in terms of
the mean relative error of the best architectures found by 27.08%. These
advantages are particularly evident when the learned models are integrated into
an MPC framework, where PINN-based models consistently outperform their purely
data-driven counterparts in terms of control accuracy and robustness, yielding
improvements of up to 42.86% in performance stability error and increased
robustness-to-noise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07841v1,,False
Semantic-Enhanced Time-Series Forecasting via Large Language Models,11/08/2025,"Hao Liu, Chun Yang, Zhang xiaoxing, Xiaobin Zhu","Time series forecasting plays a significant role in finance, energy,
meteorology, and IoT applications. Recent studies have leveraged the
generalization capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to adapt to time
series forecasting, achieving promising performance. However, existing studies
focus on token-level modal alignment, instead of bridging the intrinsic
modality gap between linguistic knowledge structures and time series data
patterns, greatly limiting the semantic representation. To address this issue,
we propose a novel Semantic-Enhanced LLM (SE-LLM) that explores the inherent
periodicity and anomalous characteristics of time series to embed into the
semantic space to enhance the token embedding. This process enhances the
interpretability of tokens for LLMs, thereby activating the potential of LLMs
for temporal sequence analysis. Moreover, existing Transformer-based LLMs excel
at capturing long-range dependencies but are weak at modeling short-term
anomalies in time-series data. Hence, we propose a plugin module embedded
within self-attention that models long-term and short-term dependencies to
effectively adapt LLMs to time-series analysis. Our approach freezes the LLM
and reduces the sequence dimensionality of tokens, greatly reducing
computational consumption. Experiments demonstrate the superiority performance
of our SE-LLM against the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07697v1,,False
"AIS-LLM: A Unified Framework for Maritime Trajectory Prediction, Anomaly Detection, and Collision Risk Assessment with Explainable Forecasting",11/08/2025,"Hyobin Park, Jinwook Jung, Minseok Seo, Hyunsoo Choi, Deukjae Cho, Sekil Park, Dong-Geol Choi","With the increase in maritime traffic and the mandatory implementation of the
Automatic Identification System (AIS), the importance and diversity of maritime
traffic analysis tasks based on AIS data, such as vessel trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and collision risk assessment, is rapidly growing. However,
existing approaches tend to address these tasks individually, making it
difficult to holistically consider complex maritime situations. To address this
limitation, we propose a novel framework, AIS-LLM, which integrates time-series
AIS data with a large language model (LLM). AIS-LLM consists of a Time-Series
Encoder for processing AIS sequences, an LLM-based Prompt Encoder, a
Cross-Modality Alignment Module for semantic alignment between time-series data
and textual prompts, and an LLM-based Multi-Task Decoder. This architecture
enables the simultaneous execution of three key tasks: trajectory prediction,
anomaly detection, and risk assessment of vessel collisions within a single
end-to-end system. Experimental results demonstrate that AIS-LLM outperforms
existing methods across individual tasks, validating its effectiveness.
Furthermore, by integratively analyzing task outputs to generate situation
summaries and briefings, AIS-LLM presents the potential for more intelligent

GLiClass: Generalist Lightweight Model for Sequence Classification Tasks,11/08/2025,"Ihor Stepanov, Mykhailo Shtopko, Dmytro Vodianytskyi, Oleksandr Lukashov, Alexander Yavorskyi, Mykyta Yaroshenko","Classification is one of the most widespread tasks in AI applications,
serving often as the first step in filtering, sorting, and categorizing data.
Since modern AI systems must handle large volumes of input data and early
pipeline stages can propagate errors downstream, achieving high efficiency and
accuracy is critical. Moreover, classification requirements can change
dynamically based on user needs, necessitating models with strong zero-shot
capabilities. While generative LLMs have become mainstream for zero-shot
classification due to their versatility, they suffer from inconsistent
instruction following and computational inefficiency. Cross-encoders, commonly
used as rerankers in RAG pipelines, face a different bottleneck: they must
process text-label pairs sequentially, significantly reducing efficiency with
large label sets. Embedding-based approaches offer good efficiency but struggle
with complex scenarios involving logical and semantic constraints. We propose
GLiClass, a novel method that adapts the GLiNER architecture for sequence
classification tasks. Our approach achieves strong accuracy and efficiency
comparable to embedding-based methods, while maintaining the flexibility needed
for zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. Additionally, we adapted
proximal policy optimization (PPO) for multi-label text classification,

SOFA: Deep Learning Framework for Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation,11/08/2025,"Yunsung Chung, Chanho Lim, Ghassan Bidaoui, Christian Massad, Nassir Marrouche, Jihun Hamm","Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a prevalent cardiac arrhythmia often treated with
catheter ablation procedures, but procedural outcomes are highly variable.
Evaluating and improving ablation efficacy is challenging due to the complex
interaction between patient-specific tissue and procedural factors. This paper
asks two questions: Can AF recurrence be predicted by simulating the effects of
procedural parameters? How should we ablate to reduce AF recurrence? We propose
SOFA (Simulating and Optimizing Atrial Fibrillation Ablation), a novel
deep-learning framework that addresses these questions. SOFA first simulates
the outcome of an ablation strategy by generating a post-ablation image
depicting scar formation, conditioned on a patient's pre-ablation LGE-MRI and
the specific procedural parameters used (e.g., ablation locations, duration,
temperature, power, and force). During this simulation, it predicts AF
recurrence risk. Critically, SOFA then introduces an optimization scheme that
refines these procedural parameters to minimize the predicted risk. Our method
leverages a multi-modal, multi-view generator that processes 2.5D
representations of the atrium. Quantitative evaluations show that SOFA
accurately synthesizes post-ablation images and that our optimization scheme
leads to a 22.18\% reduction in the model-predicted recurrence risk. To the
best of our knowledge, SOFA is the first framework to integrate the simulation
of procedural effects, recurrence prediction, and parameter optimization,
offering a novel tool for personalizing AF ablation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.07621v1,,False
