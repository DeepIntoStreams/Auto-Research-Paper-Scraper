Dense Video Captioning using Graph-based Sentence Summarization,25/06/2025,"Zhiwang Zhang, Dong Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Luping Zhou","Recently, dense video captioning has made attractive progress in detecting
and captioning all events in a long untrimmed video. Despite promising results
were achieved, most existing methods do not sufficiently explore the scene
evolution within an event temporal proposal for captioning, and therefore
perform less satisfactorily when the scenes and objects change over a
relatively long proposal. To address this problem, we propose a graph-based
partition-and-summarization (GPaS) framework for dense video captioning within
two stages. For the ``partition"" stage, a whole event proposal is split into
short video segments for captioning at a finer level. For the ``summarization""
stage, the generated sentences carrying rich description information for each
segment are summarized into one sentence to describe the whole event. We
particularly focus on the ``summarization"" stage, and propose a framework that
effectively exploits the relationship between semantic words for summarization.
We achieve this goal by treating semantic words as nodes in a graph and
learning their interactions by coupling Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), with the aid of visual cues. Two schemes of
GCN-LSTM Interaction (GLI) modules are proposed for seamless integration of GCN
and LSTM. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via an extensive
comparison with the state-of-the-arts methods on the two benchmarks ActivityNet
Captions dataset and YouCook II dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20583v1,,False
"Show, Tell and Summarize: Dense Video Captioning Using Visual Cue Aided Sentence Summarization",25/06/2025,"Zhiwang Zhang, Dong Xu, Wanli Ouyang, Chuanqi Tan","In this work, we propose a division-and-summarization (DaS) framework for
dense video captioning. After partitioning each untrimmed long video as
multiple event proposals, where each event proposal consists of a set of short
video segments, we extract visual feature (e.g., C3D feature) from each segment
and use the existing image/video captioning approach to generate one sentence
description for this segment. Considering that the generated sentences contain
rich semantic descriptions about the whole event proposal, we formulate the
dense video captioning task as a visual cue aided sentence summarization
problem and propose a new two stage Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) approach
equipped with a new hierarchical attention mechanism to summarize all generated
sentences as one descriptive sentence with the aid of visual features.
Specifically, the first-stage LSTM network takes all semantic words from the
generated sentences and the visual features from all segments within one event
proposal as the input, and acts as the encoder to effectively summarize both
semantic and visual information related to this event proposal. The
second-stage LSTM network takes the output from the first-stage LSTM network
and the visual features from all video segments within one event proposal as
the input, and acts as the decoder to generate one descriptive sentence for
this event proposal. Our comprehensive experiments on the ActivityNet Captions
dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our newly proposed DaS framework for
dense video captioning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20567v1,,False
Physics-Informed Machine Learning Regulated by Finite Element Analysis for Simulation Acceleration of Laser Powder Bed Fusion,25/06/2025,"R. Sharma, M. Raissi, Y. B. Guo","Efficient simulation of Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) is crucial for process
prediction due to the lasting issue of high computation cost using traditional
numerical methods such as finite element analysis (FEA). This study presents an
efficient modeling framework termed FEA-Regulated Physics-Informed Neural
Network (FEA-PINN) to accelerate the thermal field prediction in a LPBF process
while maintaining the FEA accuracy. A novel dynamic material updating strategy
is developed to capture the dynamic phase change of powder-liquid-solid in the
PINN model. The PINN model incorporates temperature-dependent material
properties and phase change behavior using the apparent heat capacity method.
While the PINN model demonstrates high accuracy with a small training data and
enables generalization of new process parameters via transfer learning, it
faces the challenge of high computation cost in time-dependent problems due to
the residual accumulation. To overcome this issue, the FEA-PINN framework
integrates corrective FEA simulations during inference to enforce physical
consistency and reduce error drift. A comparative analysis shows that FEA-PINN
achieves equivalent accuracy to FEA while significantly reducing computational
cost. The framework has been validated using the benchmark FEA data and
demonstrated through single-track scanning in LPBF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20537v1,,False
Industrial Energy Disaggregation with Digital Twin-generated Dataset and Efficient Data Augmentation,25/06/2025,"Christian Internò, Andrea Castellani, Sebastian Schmitt, Fabio Stella, Barbara Hammer","Industrial Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is limited by the scarcity of
high-quality datasets and the complex variability of industrial energy
consumption patterns. To address data scarcity and privacy issues, we introduce
the Synthetic Industrial Dataset for Energy Disaggregation (SIDED), an
open-source dataset generated using Digital Twin simulations. SIDED includes
three types of industrial facilities across three different geographic
locations, capturing diverse appliance behaviors, weather conditions, and load
profiles. We also propose the Appliance-Modulated Data Augmentation (AMDA)
method, a computationally efficient technique that enhances NILM model
generalization by intelligently scaling appliance power contributions based on
their relative impact. We show in experiments that NILM models trained with
AMDA-augmented data significantly improve the disaggregation of energy
consumption of complex industrial appliances like combined heat and power
systems. Specifically, in our out-of-sample scenarios, models trained with AMDA
achieved a Normalized Disaggregation Error of 0.093, outperforming models
trained without data augmentation (0.451) and those trained with random data
augmentation (0.290). Data distribution analyses confirm that AMDA effectively
aligns training and test data distributions, enhancing model generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20525v1,,False
SV-LLM: An Agentic Approach for SoC Security Verification using Large Language Models,25/06/2025,"Dipayan Saha, Shams Tarek, Hasan Al Shaikh, Khan Thamid Hasan, Pavan Sai Nalluri, Md. Ajoad Hasan, Nashmin Alam, Jingbo Zhou, Sujan Kumar Saha, Mark Tehranipoor, Farimah Farahmandi","Ensuring the security of complex system-on-chips (SoCs) designs is a critical
imperative, yet traditional verification techniques struggle to keep pace due
to significant challenges in automation, scalability, comprehensiveness, and
adaptability. The advent of large language models (LLMs), with their remarkable
capabilities in natural language understanding, code generation, and advanced
reasoning, presents a new paradigm for tackling these issues. Moving beyond
monolithic models, an agentic approach allows for the creation of multi-agent
systems where specialized LLMs collaborate to solve complex problems more
effectively. Recognizing this opportunity, we introduce SV-LLM, a novel
multi-agent assistant system designed to automate and enhance SoC security
verification. By integrating specialized agents for tasks like verification
question answering, security asset identification, threat modeling, test plan
and property generation, vulnerability detection, and simulation-based bug
validation, SV-LLM streamlines the workflow. To optimize their performance in
these diverse tasks, agents leverage different learning paradigms, such as
in-context learning, fine-tuning, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). The
system aims to reduce manual intervention, improve accuracy, and accelerate
security analysis, supporting proactive identification and mitigation of risks
early in the design cycle. We demonstrate its potential to transform hardware
security practices through illustrative case studies and experiments that
showcase its applicability and efficacy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20415v1,,False
TESSERA: Temporal Embeddings of Surface Spectra for Earth Representation and Analysis,25/06/2025,"Zhengpeng Feng, Sadiq Jaffer, Jovana Knezevic, Silja Sormunen, Robin Young, Madeline Lisaius, Markus Immitzer, James Ball, Clement Atzberger, David A. Coomes, Anil Madhavapeddy, Andrew Blake, Srinivasan Keshav","Satellite remote sensing (RS) enables a wide array of downstream Earth
observation (EO) applications, including climate modeling, carbon accounting,
and strategies for conservation and sustainable land use. We present TESSERA, a
novel Remote Sensing Foundation Model (RSFM) that uses Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) to generate global, robust representations at 10m scale from pixel-level
satellite time series data. TESSERA combines information from only optical and
SAR data streams using two parallel Transformer-based encoders: one dedicated
to Sentinel-1 SAR polarizations and another to Sentinel-2 MSI data (10 selected
spectral bands) to create representations that are then fused using a
multilayer perceptron (MLP), resulting in a global representation map covering
the years 2017 to 2024. Our precomputed representations set a new
state-of-the-art performance benchmark and our open-source approach
democratizes access to high-performance, high-resolution representations. We
benchmark the performance of TESSERA in five diverse tasks, comparing our work
with state-of-the-art task-specific models and other foundation models. Our
results show that TESSERA outperforms both traditional RS baselines and the
leading geospatial foundation models in these diverse downstream tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20380v1,,False
A foundation model with multi-variate parallel attention to generate neuronal activity,25/06/2025,"Francesco Carzaniga, Michael Hersche, Abu Sebastian, Kaspar Schindler, Abbas Rahimi","Learning from multi-variate time-series with heterogeneous channel
configurations remains a fundamental challenge for deep neural networks (DNNs),
particularly in clinical domains such as intracranial electroencephalography
(iEEG), where channel setups vary widely across subjects. In this work, we
introduce multi-variate parallel attention (MVPA), a novel self-attention
mechanism that disentangles content, temporal, and spatial attention, enabling
flexible, generalizable, and efficient modeling of time-series data with
varying channel counts and configurations. We use MVPA to build MVPFormer, a
generative foundation model for human electrophysiology, trained to predict the
evolution of iEEG signals across diverse subjects. To support this and future
effort by the community, we release the SWEC iEEG dataset, the largest publicly
available iEEG dataset to date, comprising nearly 10,000 hours of recordings
from heterogeneous clinical sources. MVPFormer leverages MVPA to achieve strong
generalization across subjects, demonstrating expert-level performance in
seizure detection and outperforming state-of-the-art Transformer baselines on
our SWEC, the MAYO, and the FNUSA dataset. We further validate MVPA on standard
time-series forecasting and classification tasks, where it matches or exceeds
existing attention-based models. Together, our contributions establish MVPA as
a general-purpose attention mechanism for heterogeneous time-series and
MVPFormer as the first open-source, open-weights, and open-data iEEG foundation
model with state-of-the-art clinical performance. The code is available at
https://github.com/IBM/multi-variate-parallel-transformer. The SWEC iEEG
dataset is available at

On the ability of Deep Neural Networks to Learn Granger Causality in Multi-Variate Time Series Data,25/06/2025,"Malik Shahid Sultan, Hernando Ombao","Granger Causality (GC) offers an elegant statistical framework to study the
association between multivariate time series data. Linear Vector Autoregressive
models (VAR) though have nice interpretation properties but have limited
practical application due to underlying assumptions on the kind of associations
that can be captured by these models. Numerous attempts have already been made
in the literature that exploit the functional approximation power of Deep
Neural Networks (DNNs) for the task of GC estimation. These methods however
treat GC as a variable selection problem. We present a novel paradigm for
approaching GC. We present this idea that GC is essentially linked with
prediction and if a deep learning model is used to model the time series
collectively or jointly, a well regularized model may learn the true granger
causal structure from the data, given that there is enough training data. We
propose to uncover the learned GC structure by comparing the model uncertainty
or distribution of the residuals when the past of everything is used as
compared to the one where a specific time series component is dropped from the
model. We also compare the effect of input layer dropout on the ability of a
neural network to learn granger causality from the data. We show that a well
regularized model infact can learn the true GC structure from the data without
explicitly adding terms in the loss function that guide the model to select
variables or perform sparse regression.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20347v1,,False
Time-series surrogates from energy consumers generated by machine learning approaches for long-term forecasting scenarios,25/06/2025,"Ben Gerhards, Nikita Popkov, Annekatrin König, Marcel Arpogaus, Bastian Schäfermeier, Leonie Riedl, Stephan Vogt, Philip Hehlert","Forecasting attracts a lot of research attention in the electricity value
chain. However, most studies concentrate on short-term forecasting of
generation or consumption with a focus on systems and less on individual
consumers. Even more neglected is the topic of long-term forecasting of
individual power consumption.
  Here, we provide an in-depth comparative evaluation of data-driven methods
for generating synthetic time series data tailored to energy consumption
long-term forecasting. High-fidelity synthetic data is crucial for a wide range
of applications, including state estimations in energy systems or power grid
planning. In this study, we assess and compare the performance of multiple
state-of-the-art but less common techniques: a hybrid Wasserstein Generative
Adversarial Network (WGAN), Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM),
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), and Masked Autoregressive Bernstein polynomial
normalizing Flows (MABF). We analyze the ability of each method to replicate
the temporal dynamics, long-range dependencies, and probabilistic transitions
characteristic of individual energy consumption profiles. Our comparative
evaluation highlights the strengths and limitations of: WGAN, DDPM, HMM and
MABF aiding in selecting the most suitable approach for state estimations and
other energy-related tasks. Our generation and analysis framework aims to
enhance the accuracy and reliability of synthetic power consumption data while
generating data that fulfills criteria like anonymisation - preserving privacy
concerns mitigating risks of specific profiling of single customers. This study
utilizes an open-source dataset from households in Germany with 15min time
resolution. The generated synthetic power profiles can readily be used in
applications like state estimations or consumption forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20253v1,,False
Language Modeling by Language Models,25/06/2025,"Junyan Cheng, Peter Clark, Kyle Richardson","Can we leverage LLMs to model the process of discovering novel language model
(LM) architectures? Inspired by real research, we propose a multi-agent LLM
approach that simulates the conventional stages of research, from ideation and
literature search (proposal stage) to design implementation (code generation),
generative pre-training, and downstream evaluation (verification). Using ideas
from scaling laws, our system, Genesys, employs a Ladder of Scales approach;
new designs are proposed, adversarially reviewed, implemented, and selectively
verified at increasingly larger model scales (14M$\sim$350M parameters) with a
narrowing budget (the number of models we can train at each scale). To help
make discovery efficient and factorizable, Genesys uses a novel genetic
programming backbone, which we show has empirical advantages over commonly used
direct prompt generation workflows (e.g., $\sim$86\% percentage point
improvement in successful design generation, a key bottleneck). We report
experiments involving 1,162 newly discovered designs (1,062 fully verified
through pre-training) and find the best designs to be highly competitive with
known architectures (e.g., outperform GPT2, Mamba2, etc., on 6/9 common
benchmarks). We couple these results with comprehensive system-level ablations
and formal results, which give broader insights into the design of effective
autonomous discovery systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20249v1,,False
SEED: A Structural Encoder for Embedding-Driven Decoding in Time Series Prediction with LLMs,25/06/2025,"Fengze Li, Yue Wang, Yangle Liu, Ming Huang, Dou Hong, Jieming Ma","Multivariate time series forecasting requires models to simultaneously
capture variable-wise structural dependencies and generalize across diverse
tasks. While structural encoders are effective in modeling feature
interactions, they lack the capacity to support semantic-level reasoning or
task adaptation. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess strong
generalization capabilities but remain incompatible with raw time series
inputs. This gap limits the development of unified, transferable prediction
systems. Therefore, we introduce SEED, a structural encoder for
embedding-driven decoding, which integrates four stages: a token-aware encoder
for patch extraction, a projection module that aligns patches with language
model embeddings, a semantic reprogramming mechanism that maps patches to
task-aware prototypes, and a frozen language model for prediction. This modular
architecture decouples representation learning from inference, enabling
efficient alignment between numerical patterns and semantic reasoning.
Empirical results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves consistent
improvements over strong baselines, and comparative studies on various datasets
confirm SEED's role in addressing the structural-semantic modeling gap.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.20167v1,,False
