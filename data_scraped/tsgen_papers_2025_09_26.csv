Taxonomy-aware Dynamic Motion Generation on Hyperbolic Manifolds,25/09/2025,"Luis Augenstein, No√©mie Jaquier, Tamim Asfour, Leonel Rozo","Human-like motion generation for robots often draws inspiration from
biomechanical studies, which often categorize complex human motions into
hierarchical taxonomies. While these taxonomies provide rich structural
information about how movements relate to one another, this information is
frequently overlooked in motion generation models, leading to a disconnect
between the generated motions and their underlying hierarchical structure. This
paper introduces the \ac{gphdm}, a novel approach that learns latent
representations preserving both the hierarchical structure of motions and their
temporal dynamics to ensure physical consistency. Our model achieves this by
extending the dynamics prior of the Gaussian Process Dynamical Model (GPDM) to
the hyperbolic manifold and integrating it with taxonomy-aware inductive
biases. Building on this geometry- and taxonomy-aware frameworks, we propose
three novel mechanisms for generating motions that are both
taxonomically-structured and physically-consistent: two probabilistic recursive
approaches and a method based on pullback-metric geodesics. Experiments on
generating realistic motion sequences on the hand grasping taxonomy show that
the proposed GPHDM faithfully encodes the underlying taxonomy and temporal
dynamics, and generates novel physically-consistent trajectories.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21281v1,,False
SuperOffload: Unleashing the Power of Large-Scale LLM Training on Superchips,25/09/2025,"Xinyu Lian, Masahiro Tanaka, Olatunji Ruwase, Minjia Zhang","The emergence of Superchips represents a significant advancement in
next-generation AI hardware. These Superchips employ a tightly coupled
heterogeneous architecture that integrates GPU and CPU on the same package,
which offers unprecedented computational power. However, there has been scant
research investigating how LLM training benefits from this new architecture. In
this work, for the first time, we study LLM training solutions based on
offloading for Superchips. We observe important differences between Superchips
and traditional loosely-coupled GPU-CPU architecture, which necessitate
revisiting prevailing assumptions about offloading. Based on that, we present
SuperOffload, a Superchip-centric offloading system that simultaneously uses
Hopper GPU, Grace CPU, and NVLink-C2C interconnect more efficiently.
SuperOffload accomplishes this via a combination of techniques, such as
adaptive weight offloading, bucketization repartitioning, Superchip-aware
casting, speculative execution, and a highly optimized Adam optimizer for Grace
CPUs. Our evaluation of SuperOffload on NVIDIA GH200 demonstrates up to 2.5x
throughput improvement compared to state-of-the-art offloading-based systems,
enabling training of up to 25B model on a single Superchip while achieving high
training throughput. We also extend SuperOffload with ZeRO-style data
parallelism and DeepSpeed-Ulysses sequence parallelism, enabling training of
13B model with sequence lengths up to 1 million tokens on 8 GH200 while
achieving 55% MFU.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21271v1,,False
From Physics to Machine Learning and Back: Part II - Learning and Observational Bias in PHM,25/09/2025,"Olga Fink, Ismail Nejjar, Vinay Sharma, Keivan Faghih Niresi, Han Sun, Hao Dong, Chenghao Xu, Amaury Wei, Arthur Bizzi, Raffael Theiler, Yuan Tian, Leandro Von Krannichfeldt, Zhan Ma, Sergei Garmaev, Zepeng Zhang, Mengjie Zhao","Prognostics and Health Management ensures the reliability, safety, and
efficiency of complex engineered systems by enabling fault detection,
anticipating equipment failures, and optimizing maintenance activities
throughout an asset lifecycle. However, real-world PHM presents persistent
challenges: sensor data is often noisy or incomplete, available labels are
limited, and degradation behaviors and system interdependencies can be highly
complex and nonlinear. Physics-informed machine learning has emerged as a
promising approach to address these limitations by embedding physical knowledge
into data-driven models. This review examines how incorporating learning and
observational biases through physics-informed modeling and data strategies can
guide models toward physically consistent and reliable predictions. Learning
biases embed physical constraints into model training through physics-informed
loss functions and governing equations, or by incorporating properties like
monotonicity. Observational biases influence data selection and synthesis to
ensure models capture realistic system behavior through virtual sensing for
estimating unmeasured states, physics-based simulation for data augmentation,
and multi-sensor fusion strategies. The review then examines how these
approaches enable the transition from passive prediction to active
decision-making through reinforcement learning, which allows agents to learn
maintenance policies that respect physical constraints while optimizing
operational objectives. This closes the loop between model-based predictions,
simulation, and actual system operation, empowering adaptive decision-making.
Finally, the review addresses the critical challenge of scaling PHM solutions
from individual assets to fleet-wide deployment. Fast adaptation methods
including meta-learning and few-shot learning are reviewed alongside domain
generalization techniques ...",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21207v1,,False
Towards Foundation Models for Zero-Shot Time Series Anomaly Detection: Leveraging Synthetic Data and Relative Context Discrepancy,25/09/2025,"Tian Lan, Hao Duong Le, Jinbo Li, Wenjun He, Meng Wang, Chenghao Liu, Chen Zhang","Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a critical task, but developing
models that generalize to unseen data in a zero-shot manner remains a major
challenge. Prevailing foundation models for TSAD predominantly rely on
reconstruction-based objectives, which suffer from a fundamental objective
mismatch: they struggle to identify subtle anomalies while often
misinterpreting complex normal patterns, leading to high rates of false
negatives and positives. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
\texttt{TimeRCD}, a novel foundation model for TSAD built upon a new
pre-training paradigm: Relative Context Discrepancy (RCD). Instead of learning
to reconstruct inputs, \texttt{TimeRCD} is explicitly trained to identify
anomalies by detecting significant discrepancies between adjacent time windows.
This relational approach, implemented with a standard Transformer architecture,
enables the model to capture contextual shifts indicative of anomalies that
reconstruction-based methods often miss. To facilitate this paradigm, we
develop a large-scale, diverse synthetic corpus with token-level anomaly
labels, providing the rich supervisory signal necessary for effective
pre-training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{TimeRCD}
significantly outperforms existing general-purpose and anomaly-specific
foundation models in zero-shot TSAD across diverse datasets. Our results
validate the superiority of the RCD paradigm and establish a new, effective
path toward building robust and generalizable foundation models for time series
anomaly detection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21190v1,,False
CAD-Tokenizer: Towards Text-based CAD Prototyping via Modality-Specific Tokenization,25/09/2025,"Ruiyu Wang, Shizhao Sun, Weijian Ma, Jiang Bian","Computer-Aided Design (CAD) is a foundational component of industrial
prototyping, where models are defined not by raw coordinates but by
construction sequences such as sketches and extrusions. This sequential
structure enables both efficient prototype initialization and subsequent
editing. Text-guided CAD prototyping, which unifies Text-to-CAD generation and
CAD editing, has the potential to streamline the entire design pipeline.
However, prior work has not explored this setting, largely because standard
large language model (LLM) tokenizers decompose CAD sequences into
natural-language word pieces, failing to capture primitive-level CAD semantics
and hindering attention modules from modeling geometric structure. We
conjecture that a multimodal tokenization strategy, aligned with CAD's
primitive and structural nature, can provide more effective representations. To
this end, we propose CAD-Tokenizer, a framework that represents CAD data with
modality-specific tokens using a sequence-based VQ-VAE with primitive-level
pooling and constrained decoding. This design produces compact, primitive-aware
representations that align with CAD's structural nature. Applied to unified
text-guided CAD prototyping, CAD-Tokenizer significantly improves instruction
following and generation quality, achieving better quantitative and qualitative
performance over both general-purpose LLMs and task-specific baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21150v1,,False
ToMPO: Training LLM Strategic Decision Making from a Multi-Agent Perspective,25/09/2025,"Yiwen Zhang, Ziang Chen, Fanqi Kong, Yizhe Huang, Xue Feng","Large Language Models (LLMs) have been used to make decisions in complex
scenarios, where they need models to think deeply, reason logically, and decide
wisely. Many existing studies focus solely on multi-round conversations in
social tasks or simulated environments, neglecting the various types of
decisions and their interdependence. Current reinforcement learning methods
struggle to consider the strategies of others during training. To address these
issues, we first define a strategic decision-making problem that includes two
types of decisions and their temporal dependencies. Furthermore, we propose
**T**heory **o**f **M**ind **P**olicy **O**ptimization **(ToMPO)** algorithm to
optimize the perception of other individual strategies and the game situation
trends. Compared to the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm,
ToMPO enhances the LLM's strategic decision-making mainly by: 1) generating
rollouts based on reasoning the strategies of other individuals, 2) estimating
advantages at both the graph-level and sample-level, and 3) balancing global
and partial rewards. The ToMPO algorithm outperforms the GRPO method by 35% in
terms of model output compliance and cooperative outcomes. Additionally, when
compared to models with parameter sizes 100 times larger, it shows an 18%
improvement. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the ToMPO algorithm in
enhancing the model's strategic decision-making capabilities.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21134v1,,False
Cross-Modal Instructions for Robot Motion Generation,25/09/2025,"William Barron, Xiaoxiang Dong, Matthew Johnson-Roberson, Weiming Zhi","Teaching robots novel behaviors typically requires motion demonstrations via
teleoperation or kinaesthetic teaching, that is, physically guiding the robot.
While recent work has explored using human sketches to specify desired
behaviors, data collection remains cumbersome, and demonstration datasets are
difficult to scale. In this paper, we introduce an alternative paradigm,
Learning from Cross-Modal Instructions, where robots are shaped by
demonstrations in the form of rough annotations, which can contain free-form
text labels, and are used in lieu of physical motion. We introduce the
CrossInstruct framework, which integrates cross-modal instructions as examples
into the context input to a foundational vision-language model (VLM). The VLM
then iteratively queries a smaller, fine-tuned model, and synthesizes the
desired motion over multiple 2D views. These are then subsequently fused into a
coherent distribution over 3D motion trajectories in the robot's workspace. By
incorporating the reasoning of the large VLM with a fine-grained pointing
model, CrossInstruct produces executable robot behaviors that generalize beyond
the environment of in the limited set of instruction examples. We then
introduce a downstream reinforcement learning pipeline that leverages
CrossInstruct outputs to efficiently learn policies to complete fine-grained
tasks. We rigorously evaluate CrossInstruct on benchmark simulation tasks and
real hardware, demonstrating effectiveness without additional fine-tuning and
providing a strong initialization for policies subsequently refined via
reinforcement learning.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21107v1,,False
"Recon-Act: A Self-Evolving Multi-Agent Browser-Use System via Web Reconnaissance, Tool Generation, and Task Execution",25/09/2025,"Kaiwen He, Zhiwei Wang, Chenyi Zhuang, Jinjie Gu","Recent years, multimodal models have made remarkable strides and pave the way
for intelligent browser use agents. However, when solving tasks on real world
webpages in multi-turn, long-horizon trajectories, current agents still suffer
from disordered action sequencing and excessive trial and error during
execution. This paper introduces Recon-Act, a self-evolving multi-agent
framework grounded in Reconnaissance-Action behavioral paradigm. The system
comprises a Reconnaissance Team and an Action Team: the former conducts
comparative analysis and tool generation, while the latter handles intent
decomposition, tool orchestration, and execution. By contrasting the erroneous
trajectories with successful ones, the Reconnaissance Team infers remedies, and
abstracts them into a unified notion of generalized tools, either expressed as
hints or as rule-based codes, and register to the tool archive in real time.
The Action Team reinference the process empowered with these targeting tools,
thus establishing a closed-loop training pipeline of
data-tools-action-feedback. Following the 6 level implementation roadmap
proposed in this work, we have currently reached Level 3 (with limited
human-in-the-loop intervention). Leveraging generalized tools obtained through
reconnaissance, Recon-Act substantially improves adaptability to unseen
websites and solvability on long-horizon tasks, and achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the challenging VisualWebArena dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21072v1,,False
Lossless Compression: A New Benchmark for Time Series Model Evaluation,25/09/2025,"Meng Wan, Benxi Tian, Jue Wang, Cui Hui, Ningming Nie, Tiantian Liu, Zongguo Wang, Cao Rongqiang, Peng Shi, Yangang Wang","The evaluation of time series models has traditionally focused on four
canonical tasks: forecasting, imputation, anomaly detection, and
classification. While these tasks have driven significant progress, they
primarily assess task-specific performance and do not rigorously measure
whether a model captures the full generative distribution of the data. We
introduce lossless compression as a new paradigm for evaluating time series
models, grounded in Shannon's source coding theorem. This perspective
establishes a direct equivalence between optimal compression length and the
negative log-likelihood, providing a strict and unified information-theoretic
criterion for modeling capacity. Then We define a standardized evaluation
protocol and metrics. We further propose and open-source a comprehensive
evaluation framework TSCom-Bench, which enables the rapid adaptation of time
series models as backbones for lossless compression. Experiments across diverse
datasets on state-of-the-art models, including TimeXer, iTransformer, and
PatchTST, demonstrate that compression reveals distributional weaknesses
overlooked by classic benchmarks. These findings position lossless compression
as a principled task that complements and extends existing evaluation for time
series modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.21002v1,,False
Empirical PAC-Bayes bounds for Markov chains,25/09/2025,"Vahe Karagulyan, Pierre Alquier","The core of generalization theory was developed for independent observations.
Some PAC and PAC-Bayes bounds are available for data that exhibit a temporal
dependence. However, there are constants in these bounds that depend on
properties of the data-generating process: mixing coefficients, mixing time,
spectral gap... Such constants are unknown in practice. In this paper, we prove
a new PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains. This bound depends on a quantity
called the pseudo-spectral gap. The main novelty is that we can provide an
empirical bound on the pseudo-spectral gap when the state space is finite.
Thus, we obtain the first fully empirical PAC-Bayes bound for Markov chains.
This extends beyond the finite case, although this requires additional
assumptions. On simulated experiments, the empirical version of the bound is
essentially as tight as the non-empirical one.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20985v1,,False
GenFacts-Generative Counterfactual Explanations for Multi-Variate Time Series,25/09/2025,"Sarah Seifi, Anass Ibrahimi, Tobias Sukianto, Cecilia Carbonelli, Lorenzo Servadei, Robert Wille","Counterfactual explanations aim to enhance model transparency by showing how
inputs can be minimally altered to change predictions. For multivariate time
series, existing methods often generate counterfactuals that are invalid,
implausible, or unintuitive. We introduce GenFacts, a generative framework
based on a class-discriminative variational autoencoder. It integrates
contrastive and classification-consistency objectives, prototype-based
initialization, and realism-constrained optimization. We evaluate GenFacts on
radar gesture data as an industrial use case and handwritten letter
trajectories as an intuitive benchmark. Across both datasets, GenFacts
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in plausibility (+18.7%) and achieves
the highest interpretability scores in a human study. These results highlight
that plausibility and user-centered interpretability, rather than sparsity
alone, are key to actionable counterfactuals in time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20936v1,,False
Conditionally Whitened Generative Models for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting,25/09/2025,"Yanfeng Yang, Siwei Chen, Pingping Hu, Zhaotong Shen, Yingjie Zhang, Zhuoran Sun, Shuai Li, Ziqi Chen, Kenji Fukumizu","Probabilistic forecasting of multivariate time series is challenging due to
non-stationarity, inter-variable dependencies, and distribution shifts. While
recent diffusion and flow matching models have shown promise, they often ignore
informative priors such as conditional means and covariances. In this work, we
propose Conditionally Whitened Generative Models (CW-Gen), a framework that
incorporates prior information through conditional whitening. Theoretically, we
establish sufficient conditions under which replacing the traditional terminal
distribution of diffusion models, namely the standard multivariate normal, with
a multivariate normal distribution parameterized by estimators of the
conditional mean and covariance improves sample quality. Guided by this
analysis, we design a novel Joint Mean-Covariance Estimator (JMCE) that
simultaneously learns the conditional mean and sliding-window covariance.
Building on JMCE, we introduce Conditionally Whitened Diffusion Models
(CW-Diff) and extend them to Conditionally Whitened Flow Matching (CW-Flow).
Experiments on five real-world datasets with six state-of-the-art generative
models demonstrate that CW-Gen consistently enhances predictive performance,
capturing non-stationary dynamics and inter-variable correlations more
effectively than prior-free approaches. Empirical results further demonstrate
that CW-Gen can effectively mitigate the effects of distribution shift.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20928v1,,False
Nuclear Diffusion Models for Low-Rank Background Suppression in Videos,25/09/2025,"Tristan S. W. Stevens, Ois√≠n Nolan, Jean-Luc Robert, Ruud J. G. van Sloun","Video sequences often contain structured noise and background artifacts that
obscure dynamic content, posing challenges for accurate analysis and
restoration. Robust principal component methods address this by decomposing
data into low-rank and sparse components. Still, the sparsity assumption often
fails to capture the rich variability present in real video data. To overcome
this limitation, a hybrid framework that integrates low-rank temporal modeling
with diffusion posterior sampling is proposed. The proposed method, Nuclear
Diffusion, is evaluated on a real-world medical imaging problem, namely cardiac
ultrasound dehazing, and demonstrates improved dehazing performance compared to
traditional RPCA concerning contrast enhancement (gCNR) and signal preservation
(KS statistic). These results highlight the potential of combining model-based

Causal Time Series Generation via Diffusion Models,25/09/2025,"Yutong Xia, Chang Xu, Yuxuan Liang, Qingsong Wen, Roger Zimmermann, Jiang Bian","Time series generation (TSG) synthesizes realistic sequences and has achieved
remarkable success. Among TSG, conditional models generate sequences given
observed covariates, however, such models learn observational correlations
without considering unobserved confounding. In this work, we propose a causal
perspective on conditional TSG and introduce causal time series generation as a
new TSG task family, formalized within Pearl's causal ladder, extending beyond
observational generation to include interventional and counterfactual settings.
To instantiate these tasks, we develop CaTSG, a unified diffusion-based
framework with backdoor-adjusted guidance that causally steers sampling toward
desired interventions and individual counterfactuals while preserving
observational fidelity. Specifically, our method derives causal score functions
via backdoor adjustment and the abduction-action-prediction procedure, thus
enabling principled support for all three levels of TSG. Extensive experiments
on both synthetic and real-world datasets show that CaTSG achieves superior
fidelity and also supporting interventional and counterfactual generation that
existing baselines cannot handle. Overall, we propose the causal TSG family and
instantiate it with CaTSG, providing an initial proof-of-concept and opening a
promising direction toward more reliable simulation under interventions and
counterfactual generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20846v1,,False
"ImaginationPolicy: Towards Generalizable, Precise and Reliable End-to-End Policy for Robotic Manipulation",25/09/2025,"Dekun Lu, Wei Gao, Kui Jia","End-to-end robot manipulation policies offer significant potential for
enabling embodied agents to understand and interact with the world. Unlike
traditional modular pipelines, end-to-end learning mitigates key limitations
such as information loss between modules and feature misalignment caused by
isolated optimization targets. Despite these advantages, existing end-to-end
neural networks for robotic manipulation--including those based on large
VLM/VLA models--remain insufficiently performant for large-scale practical
deployment. In this paper, we take a step towards an end-to-end manipulation
policy that is generalizable, accurate and reliable. To achieve this goal, we
propose a novel Chain of Moving Oriented Keypoints (CoMOK) formulation for
robotic manipulation. Our formulation is used as the action representation of a
neural policy, which can be trained in an end-to-end fashion. Such an action
representation is general, as it extends the standard end-effector pose action
representation and supports a diverse set of manipulation tasks in a unified
manner. The oriented keypoint in our method enables natural generalization to
objects with different shapes and sizes, while achieving sub-centimeter
accuracy. Moreover, our formulation can easily handle multi-stage tasks,
multi-modal robot behaviors, and deformable objects. Extensive simulated and

CaTS-Bench: Can Language Models Describe Numeric Time Series?,25/09/2025,"Luca Zhou, Pratham Yashwante, Marshall Fisher, Alessio Sampieri, Zihao Zhou, Fabio Galasso, Rose Yu","Time series captioning, the task of describing numeric time series in natural
language, requires numerical reasoning, trend interpretation, and contextual
understanding. Existing benchmarks, however, often rely on synthetic data or
overly simplistic captions, and typically neglect metadata and visual
representations. To close this gap, we introduce CaTS-Bench, the first
large-scale, real-world benchmark for Context-aware Time Series captioning.
CaTS-Bench is derived from 11 diverse datasets reframed as captioning and Q&A
tasks, comprising roughly 465k training and 105k test timestamps. Each sample
includes a numeric series segment, contextual metadata, a line-chart image, and
a caption. A key contribution of this work is the scalable pipeline used to
generate reference captions: while most references are produced by an oracle
LLM and verified through factual checks, human indistinguishability studies,
and diversity analyses, we also provide a human-revisited subset of 579 test
captions, refined from LLM outputs to ensure accuracy and human-like style.
Beyond captioning, CaTS-Bench offers 460 multiple-choice questions targeting
deeper aspects of time series reasoning. We further propose new tailored
evaluation metrics and benchmark leading VLMs, highlighting both their
strengths and persistent limitations. Together, these contributions establish
CaTS-Bench and its captioning pipeline as a reliable and extensible foundation
for future research at the intersection of time series analysis and foundation
models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20823v1,,False
Aligning Inductive Bias for Data-Efficient Generalization in State Space Models,25/09/2025,"Qiyu Chen, Guozhang Chen","The remarkable success of large-scale models is fundamentally tied to scaling
laws, yet the finite nature of high-quality data presents a looming challenge.
One of the next frontiers in modeling is data efficiency: the ability to learn
more from less. A model's inductive bias is a critical lever for this, but
foundational sequence models like State Space Models (SSMs) rely on a fixed
bias. This fixed prior is sample-inefficient when a task's underlying structure
does not match. In this work, we introduce a principled framework to solve this
problem. We first formalize the inductive bias of linear time-invariant SSMs
through an SSM-induced kernel, mathematically and empirically proving its
spectrum is directly governed by the model's frequency response. Further, we
propose a method of Task-Dependent Initialization (TDI): power spectrum
matching, a fast and efficient method that aligns the model's inductive bias
with the task's spectral characteristics before large-scale training. Our
experiments on a diverse set of real-world benchmarks show that TDI
significantly improves generalization and sample efficiency, particularly in
low-data regimes. This work provides a theoretical and practical tool to create
more data-efficient models, a crucial step towards sustainable scaling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.20789v1,,False
IConv: Focusing on Local Variation with Channel Independent Convolution for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,25/09/2025,"Gawon Lee, Hanbyeol Park, Minseop Kim, Dohee Kim, Hyerim Bae","Real-world time-series data often exhibit non-stationarity, including
changing trends, irregular seasonality, and residuals. In terms of changing
trends, recently proposed multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based models have shown
excellent performance owing to their computational efficiency and ability to
capture long-term dependency. However, the linear nature of MLP architectures
poses limitations when applied to channels with diverse distributions,
resulting in local variations such as seasonal patterns and residual components
being ignored. However, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can effectively
incorporate these variations. To resolve the limitations of MLP, we propose
combining them with CNNs. The overall trend is modeled using an MLP to consider
long-term dependencies. The CNN uses diverse kernels to model fine-grained
local patterns in conjunction with MLP trend predictions. To focus on modeling
local variation, we propose IConv, a novel convolutional architecture that
processes the temporal dependency channel independently and considers the
inter-channel relationship through distinct layers. Independent channel
processing enables the modeling of diverse local temporal dependencies and the
adoption of a large kernel size. Distinct inter-channel considerations reduce
computational cost. The proposed model is evaluated through extensive

under the video-based Learning-from-Demonstration (LfD) paradigm. Rather than
directly imitating human hand motions, our method treats demonstrations as
object-centric guides, balancing three objectives: (i) selecting a feasible
grasp pose, (ii) generating object trajectories consistent with demonstrated
motions, and (iii) ensuring collision-free execution within robot kinematics.
To capture the multimodal nature of demonstrations, we extend flow matching to
$\SE(3)$ for probabilistic modeling of object trajectories, enabling
density-aware imitation that avoids mode collapse. The resulting optimization
integrates grasp similarity, trajectory likelihood, and collision penalties

A Hierarchical Variational Graph Fused Lasso for Recovering Relative Rates in Spatial Compositional Data,25/09/2025,"Joaquim Valerio Teixeira, Ed Reznik, Sudpito Banerjee, Wesley Tansey","The analysis of spatial data from biological imaging technology, such as

relative rates for each molecule across the entire image. Our method relies on
the use of a heavy-tailed variant of the graphical lasso prior and a novel
hierarchical variational family, enabling efficient inference via automatic
differentiation variational inference. Simulation results show that our
approach outperforms state-of-the-practice point estimate methodologies in IMS,
