TreeCoders: Trees of Transformers,11/11/2024,"Pierre Colonna D'Istria, Abdulrahman Altahhan","In this paper, we introduce TreeCoders, a novel family of transformer trees.
We moved away from traditional linear transformers to complete k-ary trees.
Transformer blocks serve as nodes, and generic classifiers learn to select the
best child and route the sequence of tokens to a specific leaf. The selectors,
moved outside the transformer blocks, allow for the use of a variety of
architecture without further modifications. Furthermore, our proposed
architecture supports sparse node activation due to the logarithmic complexity
of a tree search. We validate our idea by testing a series of decoder-only tree
transformers, achieving competitive results across a diverse range of language
datasets. Our study demonstrates that the proposed tree transformer model
outperforms a size-equivalent linear transformer model 76\% of the time over a
wide range of tree architectures. Furthermore, our proposed model naturally
lends itself to distributed implementation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07218v1,,False
Data-Driven Predictive Control of Nonholonomic Robots Based on a Bilinear Koopman Realization: Data Does Not Replace Geometry,11/11/2024,"Mario Rosenfelder, Lea Bold, Hannes Eschmann, Peter Eberhard, Karl Worthmann, Henrik Ebel","Advances in machine learning and the growing trend towards effortless data
generation in real-world systems has led to an increasing interest for
data-inferred models and data-based control in robotics. It seems appealing to
govern robots solely based on data, bypassing the traditional, more elaborate
pipeline of system modeling through first-principles and subsequent controller
design. One promising data-driven approach is the Extended Dynamic Mode
Decomposition (EDMD) for control-affine systems, a system class which contains
many vehicles and machines of immense practical importance including, e.g.,
typical wheeled mobile robots. EDMD can be highly data-efficient,
computationally inexpensive, can deal with nonlinear dynamics as prevalent in
robotics and mechanics, and has a sound theoretical foundation rooted in
Koopman theory. On this background, this present paper examines how EDMD models
can be integrated into predictive controllers for nonholonomic mobile robots.
In addition to the conventional kinematic mobile robot, we also cover the
complete data-driven control pipeline - from data acquisition to control design
- when the robot is not treated in terms of first-order kinematics but in a
second-order manner, allowing to account for actuator dynamics. Using only
real-world measurement data, it is shown in both simulations and hardware
experiments that the surrogate models enable high-precision predictive
controllers in the studied cases. However, the findings raise significant
concerns about purely data-centric approaches that overlook the underlying
geometry of nonholonomic systems, showing that, for nonholonomic systems, some
geometric insight seems necessary and cannot be easily compensated for with
large amounts of data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07192v1,,False
Conditional simulation via entropic optimal transport: Toward non-parametric estimation of conditional Brenier maps,11/11/2024,"Ricardo Baptista, Aram-Alexandre Pooladian, Michael Brennan, Youssef Marzouk, Jonathan Niles-Weed","Conditional simulation is a fundamental task in statistical modeling:
Generate samples from the conditionals given finitely many data points from a
joint distribution. One promising approach is to construct conditional Brenier
maps, where the components of the map pushforward a reference distribution to
conditionals of the target. While many estimators exist, few, if any, come with
statistical or algorithmic guarantees. To this end, we propose a non-parametric
estimator for conditional Brenier maps based on the computational scalability
of \emph{entropic} optimal transport. Our estimator leverages a result of
Carlier et al. (2010), which shows that optimal transport maps under a rescaled
quadratic cost asymptotically converge to conditional Brenier maps; our
estimator is precisely the entropic analogues of these converging maps. We
provide heuristic justifications for choosing the scaling parameter in the cost
as a function of the number of samples by fully characterizing the Gaussian
setting. We conclude by comparing the performance of the estimator to other
machine learning and non-parametric approaches on benchmark datasets and
Bayesian inference problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07154v1,,False
Training Neural Networks as Recognizers of Formal Languages,11/11/2024,"Alexandra Butoi, Ghazal Khalighinejad, Anej Svete, Josef Valvoda, Ryan Cotterell, Brian DuSell","Characterizing the computational power of neural network architectures in
terms of formal language theory remains a crucial line of research, as it
describes lower and upper bounds on the reasoning capabilities of modern AI.
However, when empirically testing these bounds, existing work often leaves a
discrepancy between experiments and the formal claims they are meant to
support. The problem is that formal language theory pertains specifically to
recognizers: machines that receive a string as input and classify whether it
belongs to a language. On the other hand, it is common to instead use proxy
tasks that are similar in only an informal sense, such as language modeling or
sequence-to-sequence transduction. We correct this mismatch by training and
evaluating neural networks directly as binary classifiers of strings, using a
general method that can be applied to a wide variety of languages. As part of
this, we extend an algorithm recently proposed by Sn{\ae}bjarnarson et al.
(2024) to do length-controlled sampling of strings from regular languages, with
much better asymptotic time complexity than previous methods. We provide
results on a variety of languages across the Chomsky hierarchy for three neural
architectures: a simple RNN, an LSTM, and a causally-masked transformer. We
find that the RNN and LSTM often outperform the transformer, and that auxiliary
training objectives such as language modeling can help, although no single
objective uniformly improves performance across languages and architectures.
Our contributions will facilitate theoretically sound empirical testing of
language recognition claims in future work. We have released our datasets as a
benchmark called FLaRe (Formal Language Recognition), along with our code.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07107v1,,False
Learning Multi-Agent Collaborative Manipulation for Long-Horizon Quadrupedal Pushing,11/11/2024,"Chuye Hong, Yuming Feng, Yaru Niu, Shiqi Liu, Yuxiang Yang, Wenhao Yu, Tingnan Zhang, Jie Tan, Ding Zhao","Recently, quadrupedal locomotion has achieved significant success, but their
manipulation capabilities, particularly in handling large objects, remain
limited, restricting their usefulness in demanding real-world applications such
as search and rescue, construction, industrial automation, and room
organization. This paper tackles the task of obstacle-aware, long-horizon
pushing by multiple quadrupedal robots. We propose a hierarchical multi-agent
reinforcement learning framework with three levels of control. The high-level
controller integrates an RRT planner and a centralized adaptive policy to
generate subgoals, while the mid-level controller uses a decentralized
goal-conditioned policy to guide the robots toward these sub-goals. A
pre-trained low-level locomotion policy executes the movement commands. We
evaluate our method against several baselines in simulation, demonstrating
significant improvements over baseline approaches, with 36.0% higher success
rates and 24.5% reduction in completion time than the best baseline. Our
framework successfully enables long-horizon, obstacle-aware manipulation tasks
like Push-Cuboid and Push-T on Go1 robots in the real world.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07104v1,,False
To Train or Not to Train: Balancing Efficiency and Training Cost in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Mobile Edge Computing,11/11/2024,"Maddalena Boscaro, Federico Mason, Federico Chiariotti, Andrea Zanella","Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a key component of 6G networks, as it enables
communication and computing services to adapt to end users' requirements and
demand patterns. The management of Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) is a meaningful
example of AI application: computational resources available at the network
edge need to be carefully allocated to users, whose jobs may have different
priorities and latency requirements. The research community has developed
several AI algorithms to perform this resource allocation, but it has neglected
a key aspect: learning is itself a computationally demanding task, and
considering free training results in idealized conditions and performance in
simulations. In this work, we consider a more realistic case in which the cost
of learning is specifically accounted for, presenting a new algorithm to
dynamically select when to train a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent that
allocates resources. Our method is highly general, as it can be directly
applied to any scenario involving a training overhead, and it can approach the
same performance as an ideal learning agent even under realistic training
conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07086v1,,False
Reconstruction of neuromorphic dynamics from a single scalar time series using variational autoencoder and neural network map,11/11/2024,"Pavel V. Kuptsov, Nataliya V. Stankevich","This paper examines the reconstruction of a family of dynamical systems with
neuromorphic behavior using a single scalar time series. A model of a
physiological neuron based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism is considered.
Single time series of one of its variables is shown to be enough to train a
neural network that can operate as a discrete time dynamical system with one
control parameter. The neural network system is created in two steps. First,
the delay-coordinate embedding vectors are constructed form the original time
series and their dimension is reduced with by means of a variational
autoencoder to obtain the recovered state-space vectors. It is shown that an
appropriate reduced dimension can be determined by analyzing the autoencoder
training process. Second, pairs of the recovered state-space vectors at
consecutive time steps supplied with a constant value playing the role of a
control parameter are used to train another neural network to make it operate
as a recurrent map. The regimes of thus created neural network system observed
when its control parameter is varied are in very good accordance with those of
the original system, though they were not explicitly presented during training.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07055v1,,False
Designing Reliable Experiments with Generative Agent-Based Modeling: A Comprehensive Guide Using Concordia by Google DeepMind,11/11/2024,"Alejandro Leonardo García Navarro, Nataliia Koneva, Alfonso Sánchez-Macián, José Alberto Hernández, Manuel Goyanes","In social sciences, researchers often face challenges when conducting
large-scale experiments, particularly due to the simulations' complexity and
the lack of technical expertise required to develop such frameworks.
Agent-Based Modeling (ABM) is a computational approach that simulates agents'
actions and interactions to evaluate how their behaviors influence the
outcomes. However, the traditional implementation of ABM can be demanding and
complex. Generative Agent-Based Modeling (GABM) offers a solution by enabling
scholars to create simulations where AI-driven agents can generate complex
behaviors based on underlying rules and interactions. This paper introduces a
framework for designing reliable experiments using GABM, making sophisticated
simulation techniques more accessible to researchers across various fields. We
provide a step-by-step guide for selecting appropriate tools, designing the
model, establishing experimentation protocols, and validating results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07038v1,,False
A neural-network based anomaly detection system and a safety protocol to protect vehicular network,11/11/2024,Marco Franceschini,"This thesis addresses the use of Cooperative Intelligent Transport Systems
(CITS) to improve road safety and efficiency by enabling vehicle-to-vehicle
communication, highlighting the importance of secure and accurate data
exchange. To ensure safety, the thesis proposes a Machine Learning-based
Misbehavior Detection System (MDS) using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
to detect and mitigate incorrect or misleading messages within vehicular
networks. Trained offline on the VeReMi dataset, the detection model is tested
in real-time within a platooning scenario, demonstrating that it can prevent
nearly all accidents caused by misbehavior by triggering a defense protocol
that dissolves the platoon if anomalies are detected. The results show that
while the system can accurately detect general misbehavior, it struggles to
label specific types due to varying traffic conditions, implying the difficulty
of creating a universally adaptive protocol. However, the thesis suggests that
with more data and further refinement, this MDS could be implemented in
real-world CITS, enhancing driving safety by mitigating risks from misbehavior
in cooperative driving networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.07013v1,,False
Multi-modal Iterative and Deep Fusion Frameworks for Enhanced Passive DOA Sensing via a Green Massive H2AD MIMO Receiver,11/11/2024,"Jiatong Bai, Minghao Chen, Wankai Tang, Yifan Li, Cunhua Pan, Yongpeng Wu, Feng Shu","Most existing DOA estimation methods assume ideal source incident angles with
minimal noise. Moreover, directly using pre-estimated angles to calculate
weighted coefficients can lead to performance loss. Thus, a green multi-modal
(MM) fusion DOA framework is proposed to realize a more practical, low-cost and
high time-efficiency DOA estimation for a H$^2$AD array. Firstly, two more
efficient clustering methods, global maximum cos\_similarity clustering
(GMaxCS) and global minimum distance clustering (GMinD), are presented to infer
more precise true solutions from the candidate solution sets. Based on this, an
iteration weighted fusion (IWF)-based method is introduced to iteratively
update weighted fusion coefficients and the clustering center of the true
solution classes by using the estimated values. Particularly, the coarse DOA
calculated by fully digital (FD) subarray, serves as the initial cluster
center. The above process yields two methods called MM-IWF-GMaxCS and
MM-IWF-GMinD. To further provide a higher-accuracy DOA estimation, a fusion
network (fusionNet) is proposed to aggregate the inferred two-part true angles
and thus generates two effective approaches called MM-fusionNet-GMaxCS and
MM-fusionNet-GMinD. The simulation outcomes show the proposed four approaches
can achieve the ideal DOA performance and the CRLB. Meanwhile, proposed
MM-fusionNet-GMaxCS and MM-fusionNet-GMinD exhibit superior DOA performance
compared to MM-IWF-GMaxCS and MM-IWF-GMinD, especially in extremely-low SNR
range.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06927v1,,False
LongSafetyBench: Long-Context LLMs Struggle with Safety Issues,11/11/2024,"Mianqiu Huang, Xiaoran Liu, Shaojun Zhou, Mozhi Zhang, Chenkun Tan, Pengyu Wang, Qipeng Guo, Zhe Xu, Linyang Li, Zhikai Lei, Linlin Li, Qun Liu, Yaqian Zhou, Xipeng Qiu, Xuanjing Huang","With the development of large language models (LLMs), the sequence length of
these models continues to increase, drawing significant attention to
long-context language models. However, the evaluation of these models has been
primarily limited to their capabilities, with a lack of research focusing on
their safety. Existing work, such as ManyShotJailbreak, has to some extent
demonstrated that long-context language models can exhibit safety concerns.
However, the methods used are limited and lack comprehensiveness. In response,
we introduce \textbf{LongSafetyBench}, the first benchmark designed to
objectively and comprehensively evaluate the safety of long-context models.
LongSafetyBench consists of 10 task categories, with an average length of
41,889 words. After testing eight long-context language models on
LongSafetyBench, we found that existing models generally exhibit insufficient
safety capabilities. The proportion of safe responses from most mainstream
long-context LLMs is below 50\%. Moreover, models' safety performance in
long-context scenarios does not always align with that in short-context
scenarios. Further investigation revealed that long-context models tend to
overlook harmful content within lengthy texts. We also proposed a simple yet
effective solution, allowing open-source models to achieve performance
comparable to that of top-tier closed-source models. We believe that
LongSafetyBench can serve as a valuable benchmark for evaluating the safety
capabilities of long-context language models. We hope that our work will
encourage the broader community to pay attention to the safety of long-context
models and contribute to the development of solutions to improve the safety of
long-context LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06899v1,,False
LA4SR: illuminating the dark proteome with generative AI,11/11/2024,"David R. Nelson, Ashish Kumar Jaiswal, Noha Ismail, Alexandra Mystikou, Kourosh Salehi-Ashtiani","AI language models (LMs) show promise for biological sequence analysis. We
re-engineered open-source LMs (GPT-2, BLOOM, DistilRoBERTa, ELECTRA, and Mamba,
ranging from 70M to 12B parameters) for microbial sequence classification. The
models achieved F1 scores up to 95 and operated 16,580x faster and at 2.9x the
recall of BLASTP. They effectively classified the algal dark proteome -
uncharacterized proteins comprising about 65% of total proteins - validated on
new data including a new, complete Hi-C/Pacbio Chlamydomonas genome. Larger
(>1B) LA4SR models reached high accuracy (F1 > 86) when trained on less than 2%
of available data, rapidly achieving strong generalization capacity. High
accuracy was achieved when training data had intact or scrambled terminal
information, demonstrating robust generalization to incomplete sequences.
Finally, we provide custom AI explainability software tools for attributing
amino acid patterns to AI generative processes and interpret their outputs in
evolutionary and biophysical contexts.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06798v1,,False
White-Box Diffusion Transformer for single-cell RNA-seq generation,11/11/2024,"Zhuorui Cui, Shengze Dong, Ding Liu","As a powerful tool for characterizing cellular subpopulations and cellular
heterogeneity, single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology offers
advantages of high throughput and multidimensional analysis. However, the
process of data acquisition is often constrained by high cost and limited
sample availability. To overcome these limitations, we propose a hybrid model
based on Diffusion model and White-Box transformer that aims to generate
synthetic and biologically plausible scRNA-seq data. Diffusion model
progressively introduce noise into the data and then recover the original data
through a denoising process, a forward and reverse process that is particularly
suitable for generating complex data distributions. White-Box transformer is a
deep learning architecture that emphasizes mathematical interpretability. By
minimizing the encoding rate of the data and maximizing the sparsity of the
representation, it not only reduces the computational burden, but also provides
clear insight into underlying structure. Our White-Box Diffusion Transformer
combines the generative capabilities of Diffusion model with the mathematical
interpretability of White-Box transformer. Through experiments using six
different single-cell RNA-Seq datasets, we visualize both generated and real
data using t-SNE dimensionality reduction technique, as well as quantify
similarity between generated and real data using various metrics to demonstrate
comparable performance of White-Box Diffusion Transformer and Diffusion
Transformer in generating scRNA-seq data alongside significant improvements in
training efficiency and resource utilization. Our code is available at

QuadWBG: Generalizable Quadrupedal Whole-Body Grasping,11/11/2024,"Jilong Wang, Javokhirbek Rajabov, Chaoyi Xu, Yiming Zheng, He Wang","Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to
significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite
considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation
methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for
real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a
modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation
controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement
learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5
dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric,
Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves
state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including
challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive
simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can

MP-PINN: A Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network for Epidemic Forecasting,11/11/2024,"Thang Nguyen, Dung Nguyen, Kha Pham, Truyen Tran","Forecasting temporal processes such as virus spreading in epidemics often
requires more than just observed time-series data, especially at the beginning
of a wave when data is limited. Traditional methods employ mechanistic models
like the SIR family, which make strong assumptions about the underlying
spreading process, often represented as a small set of compact differential
equations. Data-driven methods such as deep neural networks make no such
assumptions and can capture the generative process in more detail, but fail in
long-term forecasting due to data limitations. We propose a new hybrid method
called MP-PINN (Multi-Phase Physics-Informed Neural Network) to overcome the
limitations of these two major approaches. MP-PINN instils the spreading
mechanism into a neural network, enabling the mechanism to update in phases
over time, reflecting the dynamics of the epidemics due to policy
interventions. Experiments on COVID-19 waves demonstrate that MP-PINN achieves
superior performance over pure data-driven or model-driven approaches for both
short-term and long-term forecasting.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06781v1,,False
Shallow Signed Distance Functions for Kinematic Collision Bodies,11/11/2024,"Osman Akar, Yushan Han, Yizhou Chen, Weixian Lan, Benn Gallagher, Ronald Fedkiw, Joseph Teran","We present learning-based implicit shape representations designed for
real-time avatar collision queries arising in the simulation of clothing.
Signed distance functions (SDFs) have been used for such queries for many years
due to their computational efficiency. Recently deep neural networks have been
used for implicit shape representations (DeepSDFs) due to their ability to
represent multiple shapes with modest memory requirements compared to
traditional representations over dense grids. However, the computational
expense of DeepSDFs prevents their use in real-time clothing simulation
applications. We design a learning-based representation of SDFs for human
avatars whoes bodies change shape kinematically due to joint-based skinning.
Rather than using a single DeepSDF for the entire avatar, we use a collection
of extremely computationally efficient (shallow) neural networks that represent
localized deformations arising from changes in body shape induced by the
variation of a single joint. This requires a stitching process to combine each
shallow SDF in the collection together into one SDF representing the signed
closest distance to the boundary of the entire body. To achieve this we augment
each shallow SDF with an additional output that resolves whether or not the
individual shallow SDF value is referring to a closest point on the boundary of
the body, or to a point on the interior of the body (but on the boundary of the
individual shallow SDF). Our model is extremely fast and accurate and we
demonstrate its applicability with real-time simulation of garments driven by
animated characters.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06719v1,,False
Mixed Effects Deep Learning Autoencoder for interpretable analysis of single cell RNA Sequencing data,11/11/2024,"Aixa X. Andrade, Son Nguyen, Albert Montillo","Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data are often confounded due to
technical or biological batch effects. Existing deep learning models aim to
mitigate these effects but may inadvertently discard batch-specific
information. We propose a Mixed Effects Deep Learning (MEDL) Autoencoder
framework that separately models batch-invariant (fixed effects) and
batch-specific (random effects) components. By decoupling fixed effects
representing biological states from random effects capturing batch-specific
variations, MEDL integrates both types of information into predictive models,
minimizing information loss. This approach improves interpretability enabling
2D visualizations that show how the same cell would appear across different
batches, facilitating exploration of batch-specific variations. We applied MEDL
to three datasets: Healthy Heart, Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASDc), and Acute
Myeloid Leukemia (AML). In Healthy Heart, MEDL managed 147 batches, assessing
its capacity to handle high batch numbers. In ASDc, MEDL captured donor
heterogeneity between autistic and healthy individuals, while in AML, it
distinguished heterogeneity in a complex setting with variable cell-type
presence and malignant cells in diseased donors. These applications demonstrate
MEDL's potential to capture fixed and random effects, improve visualization,
and enhance predictive accuracy, offering a robust framework for cellular
heterogeneity analysis across diverse datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.06635v1,,False
