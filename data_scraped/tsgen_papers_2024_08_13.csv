The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery,12/08/2024,"Chris Lu, Cong Lu, Robert Tjarko Lange, Jakob Foerster, Jeff Clune, David Ha","One of the grand challenges of artificial general intelligence is developing
agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge.
While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g.
for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct
only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first
comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling
frontier large language models to perform research independently and
communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates
novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results,
describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a
simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be
repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the
human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to
three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling,
transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is
implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per
paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated
reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper
scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance
threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated
reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific
discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI
agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a
world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on
the world's most challenging problems. Our code is open-sourced at

ACCELERATION: Sequentially-scanning DECT Imaging Using High Temporal Resolution Image Reconstruction And Temporal Extrapolation,12/08/2024,"Qiaoxin Li, Dong Liang, Yinsheng Li","Dual-energy computed tomography (DECT) has been widely used to obtain
quantitative elemental composition of imaged subjects for personalized and
precise medical diagnosis. Compared with existing high-end DECT leveraging
advanced X-ray source and/or detector technologies, the use of the
sequentially-scanning data acquisition scheme to implement DECT may make
broader impact on clinical practice because this scheme requires no specialized
hardware designs. However, since the concentration of iodinated contrast agent
in the imaged subject varies over time, sequentially-scanned data sets acquired
at two tube potentials are temporally inconsistent. As existing material
decomposition approaches for DECT assume that the data sets acquired at two
tube potentials are temporally consistent, the violation of this assumption
results in inaccurate quantification accuracy of iodine concentration. In this
work, we developed a technique to achieve sequentially-scanning DECT imaging
using high temporal resolution image reconstruction and temporal extrapolation,
ACCELERATION in short, to address the technical challenge induced by temporal
inconsistency of sequentially-scanned data sets and improve iodine
quantification accuracy in sequentially-scanning DECT. ACCELERATION has been
validated and evaluated using numerical simulation data sets generated from
clinical human subject exams. Results demonstrated the improvement of iodine
quantification accuracy using ACCELERATION.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06163v1,,False
Generalization capabilities of MeshGraphNets to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics,12/08/2024,"Robin Schmöcker, Alexander Henkes, Julian Roth, Thomas Wick","This works investigates the generalization capabilities of MeshGraphNets
(MGN) [Pfaff et al. Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks. ICML
2021] to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics, e.g. predicting the flow around
a new obstacle that was not part of the training data. For this purpose, we
create a new benchmark dataset for data-driven computational fluid dynamics
(CFD) which extends DeepMind's flow around a cylinder dataset by including
different shapes and multiple objects. We then use this new dataset to extend
the generalization experiments conducted by DeepMind on MGNs by testing how
well an MGN can generalize to different shapes. In our numerical tests, we show
that MGNs can sometimes generalize well to various shapes by training on a
dataset of one obstacle shape and testing on a dataset of another obstacle
shape.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06101v1,,False
Controlling Surprisal in Music Generation via Information Content Curve Matching,12/08/2024,"Mathias Rose Bjare, Stefan Lattner, Gerhard Widmer","In recent years, the quality and public interest in music generation systems
have grown, encouraging research into various ways to control these systems. We
propose a novel method for controlling surprisal in music generation using
sequence models. To achieve this goal, we define a metric called Instantaneous
Information Content (IIC). The IIC serves as a proxy function for the perceived
musical surprisal (as estimated from a probabilistic model) and can be
calculated at any point within a music piece. This enables the comparison of
surprisal across different musical content even if the musical events occur in
irregular time intervals. We use beam search to generate musical material whose
IIC curve closely approximates a given target IIC. We experimentally show that
the IIC correlates with harmonic and rhythmic complexity and note density. The
correlation decreases with the length of the musical context used for
estimating the IIC. Finally, we conduct a qualitative user study to test if
human listeners can identify the IIC curves that have been used as targets when
generating the respective musical material. We provide code for creating IIC
interpolations and IIC visualizations on https://github.com/muthissar/iic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.06022v1,,False
Freehand Sketch Generation from Mechanical Components,12/08/2024,"Zhichao Liao, Di Huang, Heming Fang, Yue Ma, Fengyuan Piao, Xinghui Li, Long Zeng, Pingfa Feng","Drawing freehand sketches of mechanical components on multimedia devices for
AI-based engineering modeling has become a new trend. However, its development
is being impeded because existing works cannot produce suitable sketches for
data-driven research. These works either generate sketches lacking a freehand
style or utilize generative models not originally designed for this task
resulting in poor effectiveness. To address this issue, we design a two-stage
generative framework mimicking the human sketching behavior pattern, called
MSFormer, which is the first time to produce humanoid freehand sketches
tailored for mechanical components. The first stage employs Open CASCADE
technology to obtain multi-view contour sketches from mechanical components,
filtering perturbing signals for the ensuing generation process. Meanwhile, we
design a view selector to simulate viewpoint selection tasks during human
sketching for picking out information-rich sketches. The second stage
translates contour sketches into freehand sketches by a transformer-based
generator. To retain essential modeling features as much as possible and
rationalize stroke distribution, we introduce a novel edge-constraint stroke
initialization. Furthermore, we utilize a CLIP vision encoder and a new loss
function incorporating the Hausdorff distance to enhance the generalizability
and robustness of the model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance for generating freehand sketches
in the mechanical domain. Project page: https://mcfreeskegen.github.io .",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05966v1,10.1145/3664647.3681046,False
Match Point AI: A Novel AI Framework for Evaluating Data-Driven Tennis Strategies,12/08/2024,"Carlo Nübel, Alexander Dockhorn, Sanaz Mostaghim","Many works in the domain of artificial intelligence in games focus on board
or video games due to the ease of reimplementing their mechanics.
Decision-making problems in real-world sports share many similarities to such
domains. Nevertheless, not many frameworks on sports games exist. In this
paper, we present the tennis match simulation environment \textit{Match Point
AI}, in which different agents can compete against real-world data-driven bot
strategies. Next to presenting the framework, we highlight its capabilities by
illustrating, how MCTS can be used in Match Point AI to optimize the shot
direction selection problem in tennis. While the framework will be extended in
the future, first experiments already reveal that generated shot-by-shot data
of simulated tennis matches show realistic characteristics when compared to
real-world data. At the same time, reasonable shot placement strategies emerge,
which share similarities to the ones found in real-world tennis matches.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05960v1,,False
Inverse design of Non-parameterized Ventilated Acoustic Resonator via Variational Autoencoder with Acoustic Response-encoded Latent Space,12/08/2024,"Min Woo Cho, Seok Hyeon Hwang, Jun-Young Jang, Jin Yeong Song, Sun-kwang Hwang, Kyoung Je Cha, Dong Yong Park, Kyungjun Song, Sang Min Park","Ventilated acoustic resonator(VAR), a type of acoustic metamaterial, emerge
as an alternative for sound attenuation in environments that require
ventilation, owing to its excellent low-frequency attenuation performance and
flexible shape adaptability. However, due to the non-linear acoustic responses
of VARs, the VAR designs are generally obtained within a limited parametrized
design space, and the design relies on the iteration of the numerical
simulation which consumes a considerable amount of computational time and
resources. This paper proposes an acoustic response-encoded variational
autoencoder (AR-VAE), a novel variational autoencoder-based generative design
model for the efficient and accurate inverse design of VAR even with
non-parametrized designs. The AR-VAE matches the high-dimensional acoustic
response with the VAR cross-section image in the dimension-reduced latent
space, which enables the AR-VAE to generate various non-parametrized VAR
cross-section images with the target acoustic response. AR-VAE generates
non-parameterized VARs from target acoustic responses, which show a 25-fold
reduction in mean squared error compared to conventional deep learning-based
parameter searching methods while exhibiting lower average mean squared error
and peak frequency variance. By combining the inverse-designed VARs by AR-VAE,
multi-cavity VAR was devised for broadband and multitarget peak frequency
attenuation. The proposed design method presents a new approach for structural
inverse-design with a high-dimensional non-linear physical response.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05917v1,,False
GFlowNet Training by Policy Gradients,12/08/2024,"Puhua Niu, Shili Wu, Mingzhou Fan, Xiaoning Qian","Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have been shown effective to generate
combinatorial objects with desired properties. We here propose a new GFlowNet
training framework, with policy-dependent rewards, that bridges keeping flow
balance of GFlowNets to optimizing the expected accumulated reward in
traditional Reinforcement-Learning (RL). This enables the derivation of new
policy-based GFlowNet training methods, in contrast to existing ones resembling
value-based RL. It is known that the design of backward policies in GFlowNet
training affects efficiency. We further develop a coupled training strategy
that jointly solves GFlowNet forward policy training and backward policy
design. Performance analysis is provided with a theoretical guarantee of our
policy-based GFlowNet training. Experiments on both simulated and real-world
datasets verify that our policy-based strategies provide advanced RL
perspectives for robust gradient estimation to improve GFlowNet performance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.05885v1,,False
