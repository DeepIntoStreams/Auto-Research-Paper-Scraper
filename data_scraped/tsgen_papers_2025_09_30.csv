ReasoningBank: Scaling Agent Self-Evolving with Reasoning Memory,29/09/2025,"Siru Ouyang, Jun Yan, I-Hung Hsu, Yanfei Chen, Ke Jiang, Zifeng Wang, Rujun Han, Long T. Le, Samira Daruki, Xiangru Tang, Vishy Tirumalashetty, George Lee, Mahsan Rofouei, Hangfei Lin, Jiawei Han, Chen-Yu Lee, Tomas Pfister","With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent
real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key
limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction
history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We
propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable
reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed
experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from
ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back,
enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful
experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling
(MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up
the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task,
the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive
signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn
guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory
and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks,
ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store
raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness
and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish
memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to
self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25140v1,,False
MGM-Omni: Scaling Omni LLMs to Personalized Long-Horizon Speech,29/09/2025,"Chengyao Wang, Zhisheng Zhong, Bohao Peng, Senqiao Yang, Yuqi Liu, Haokun Gui, Bin Xia, Jingyao Li, Bei Yu, Jiaya Jia","We present MGM-Omni, a unified Omni LLM for omni-modal understanding and
expressive, long-horizon speech generation. Unlike cascaded pipelines that
isolate speech synthesis, MGM-Omni adopts a ""brain-mouth"" design with a
dual-track, token-based architecture that cleanly decouples multimodal
reasoning from real-time speech generation. This design enables efficient
cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For
understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder
design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions.
For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech
token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice
cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent
work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient
training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing
open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences,
producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form
audio and omnimodal understanding. MGM-Omni establishes an efficient,
end-to-end paradigm for omnimodal understanding and controllable, personalised
long-horizon speech generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25131v1,,False
Hyperdimensional Probe: Decoding LLM Representations via Vector Symbolic Architectures,29/09/2025,"Marco Bronzini, Carlo Nicolini, Bruno Lepri, Jacopo Staiano, Andrea Passerini","Despite their capabilities, Large Language Models (LLMs) remain opaque with
limited understanding of their internal representations. Current
interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse
autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the
model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces
Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM
vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural
probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via
Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs
and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our
decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's
final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern
recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess
it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both
before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably
extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input
domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information
decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative,
interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25045v1,,False
Ultra-Fast Language Generation via Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct,29/09/2025,"Haoyang Zheng, Xinyang Liu, Cindy Xiangrui Kong, Nan Jiang, Zheyuan Hu, Weijian Luo, Wei Deng, Guang Lin","Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the
AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct
(DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation
models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language
model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM
counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical
part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of
integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We
also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state
matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly
improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference
performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated
language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard
dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128
NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss
of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further
validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive
ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein
sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective
distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye. We
will release both code and models at github.com/haoyangzheng-ai/didi-instruct.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25035v1,,False
Bayesian Surrogates for Risk-Aware Pre-Assessment of Aging Bridge Portfolios,29/09/2025,"Sophia V. Kuhn, Rafael Bischof, Marius Weber, Antoine Binggeli, Michael A. Kraus, Walter Kaufmann, Fernando PÃ©rez-Cruz","Aging infrastructure portfolios pose a critical resource allocation
challenge: deciding which structures require intervention and which can safely
remain in service. Structural assessments must balance the trade-off between
cheaper, conservative analysis methods and accurate but costly simulations that
do not scale portfolio-wide. We propose Bayesian neural network (BNN)
surrogates for rapid structural pre-assessment of worldwide common bridge
types, such as reinforced concrete frame bridges. Trained on a large-scale
database of non-linear finite element analyses generated via a parametric
pipeline and developed based on the Swiss Federal Railway's bridge portfolio,
the models accurately and efficiently estimate high-fidelity structural
analysis results by predicting code compliance factors with calibrated
epistemic uncertainty. Our BNN surrogate enables fast, uncertainty-aware
triage: flagging likely critical structures and providing guidance where
refined analysis is pertinent. We demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in
a real-world case study of a railway underpass, showing its potential to
significantly reduce costs and emissions by avoiding unnecessary analyses and
physical interventions across entire infrastructure portfolios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25031v1,,False
MARCOS: Deep Thinking by Markov Chain of Continuous Thoughts,29/09/2025,"Jiayu Liu, Zhenya Huang, Anya Sims, Enhong Chen, Yee Whye Teh, Ning Miao","The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves
models ""thinking out loud"" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought
(CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks.
Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT
tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains
reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck
across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with
token generation, forcing LLMs to ""think while speaking,"" which causes
potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we
re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our
approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as
a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional ""thoughts"". Each
reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit
reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable
variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this
latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we
further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on
three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous
reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to
token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup
in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as
step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant
opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25020v1,,False
MSG: Multi-Stream Generative Policies for Sample-Efficient Robotic Manipulation,29/09/2025,"Jan Ole von Hartz, Lukas Schweizer, Joschka Boedecker, Abhinav Valada","Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal
policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies
improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work,
we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition
framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at
inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is
model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various
generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments
both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns
high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting
in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89
percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present
comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide
practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object
instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at

RealUnify: Do Unified Models Truly Benefit from Unification? A Comprehensive Benchmark,29/09/2025,"Yang Shi, Yuhao Dong, Yue Ding, Yuran Wang, Xuanyu Zhu, Sheng Zhou, Wenting Liu, Haochen Tian, Rundong Wang, Huanqian Wang, Zuyan Liu, Bohan Zeng, Ruizhe Chen, Qixun Wang, Zhuoran Zhang, Xinlong Chen, Chengzhuo Tong, Bozhou Li, Chaoyou Fu, Qiang Liu, Haotian Wang, Wenjing Yang, Yuanxing Zhang, Pengfei Wan, Yi-Fan Zhang, Ziwei Liu","The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified
multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI.
However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does
this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between
the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily
assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for
determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance
its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper
comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a
benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy.
RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10
categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1)
Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense,
logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding,
which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or
disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our
dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a
diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct
understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely
discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core
abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations
of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current
unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that
architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the
need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the
potential of unified modeling.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24897v1,,False
Cell2Text: Multimodal LLM for Generating Single-Cell Descriptions from RNA-Seq Data,29/09/2025,"Oussama Kharouiche, Aris Markogiannakis, Xiao Fei, Michail Chatzianastasis, Michalis Vazirgiannis","Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed biology by enabling the
measurement of gene expression at cellular resolution, providing information
for cell types, states, and disease contexts. Recently, single-cell foundation
models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations
directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and
clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction
heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to
capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce
Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles
into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level
embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language
models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity,
tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to
unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification
accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based
similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation.
These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language
offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable
outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of
unseen cells.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24840v1,,False
Intelligent Optimization of Wireless Access Point Deployment for Communication-Based Train Control Systems Using Deep Reinforcement Learning,29/09/2025,"Kunyu Wu, Qiushi Zhao, Zihan Feng, Yunxi Mu, Hao Qin, Xinyu Zhang, Xingqi Zhang","Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control
(CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is
critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical
model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement
requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches
often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave
equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network
(cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for
AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss
distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN
to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions,
significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In
the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the
action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal
improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances
convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the
likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show
that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and
traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received
power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This
work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling,
and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for
next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24819v1,,False
DyMoDreamer: World Modeling with Dynamic Modulation,29/09/2025,"Boxuan Zhang, Runqing Wang, Wei Xiao, Weipu Zhang, Jian Sun, Gao Huang, Jie Chen, Gang Wang","A critical bottleneck in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is sample
inefficiency, as training high-performance agents often demands extensive
environmental interactions. Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates
this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate
synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world
models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects
and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally
inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly
influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we
introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic
modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich
the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived
from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level
motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic
categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model
(RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments
demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k
benchmark with a $156.6$\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new
record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\%
performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark. Our code is

TimeOmni-1: Incentivizing Complex Reasoning with Time Series in Large Language Models,29/09/2025,"Tong Guan, Zijie Meng, Dianqi Li, Shiyu Wang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Qingsong Wen, Zuozhu Liu, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Ming Jin, Shirui Pan","Recent advances in multimodal time series learning underscore a paradigm
shift from analytics centered on basic patterns toward advanced time series
understanding and reasoning. However, existing multimodal time series datasets
mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without
reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that
genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of
high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series
reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite
(TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental
capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through
scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via
event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through
deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first
comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough
evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more
than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided
hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce
TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse
real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in
multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward
functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1
delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and
achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality
discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response

DSAT-HD: Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer with Hybrid Decomposition for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting,29/09/2025,"Zixu Wang, Hongbin Dong, Xiaoping Zhang","Time series forecasting is crucial for various applications, such as weather,
traffic, electricity, and energy predictions. Currently, common time series
forecasting methods are based on Transformers. However, existing approaches
primarily model limited time series or fixed scales, making it more challenging
to capture diverse features cross different ranges. Additionally, traditional
methods like STL for complex seasonality-trend decomposition require
pre-specified seasonal periods and typically handle only single, fixed
seasonality. We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive
Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the
limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining
EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing
seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale
adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four
parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner,
enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A
dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately
process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function
minimizing expert collaboration variance. Extensive experiments on nine
datasets demonstrate that DSAT-HD outperforms existing methods overall and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on some datasets. Notably, it also
exhibits stronger generalization capabilities across various transfer
scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24800v1,,False
Assessing the risk of future Dunkelflaute events for Germany using generative deep learning,29/09/2025,"Felix Strnad, Jonathan Schmidt, Fabian Mockert, Philipp Hennig, Nicole Ludwig","The European electricity power grid is transitioning towards renewable energy
sources, characterized by an increasing share of off- and onshore wind and
solar power. However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a
challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of
low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their
potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate
the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years
and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative
deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6
ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from
ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future
occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low
(SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that
both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the
ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the

the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24788v1,,False
MarS-FM: Generative Modeling of Molecular Dynamics via Markov State Models,29/09/2025,"Kacper KapuÅniak, Cristian Gabellini, Michael Bronstein, Prudencio Tossou, Francesco Di Giovanni","Molecular Dynamics (MD) is a powerful computational microscope for probing
protein functions. However, the need for fine-grained integration and the long
timescales of biomolecular events make MD computationally expensive. To address
this, several generative models have been proposed to generate surrogate
trajectories at lower cost. Yet, these models typically learn a fixed-lag
transition density, causing the training signal to be dominated by frequent but
uninformative transitions. We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM
Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states
defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class
with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two
orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD
simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through
structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary
structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues)
with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events,
and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to
assess generalization. Across all metrics, MarS-FM outperforms existing

When risk defies order: On the limits of fractional stochastic dominance,29/09/2025,"Christian LaudagÃ©, Felix-Benedikt Liebrich","Motivated by recent work on monotone additive statistics and questions
regarding optimal risk sharing for return-based risk measures, we investigate
the existence, structure, and applications of Meyer risk measures. Those are
monetary risk measures consistent with fractional stochastic orders suggested
by Meyer (1977a,b) as refinement of second-order stochastic dominance (SSD).
These so-called $v$-SD orders are based on a threshold utility function $v$.
The test utilities defining the associated order are those at least as risk
averse in absolute terms as $v$. The generality of $v$ allows to subsume SSD
and other examples from the literature. The structure of risk measures
respecting the $v$-SD order is clarified by two types of representations. The
existence of nontrivial examples is more subtle: for many choices of $v$
outside the exponential (CARA) class, they do not exist. Additional properties
like convexity or positive homogeneity further restrict admissible examples,
even within the CARA class. We present impossibility theorems that demonstrate
a deeper link between the axiomatic structure of monetary risk measures and SSD
than previously acknowledged. The study concludes with two applications:
portfolio optimisation under a Meyer risk measure as objective, and risk
assessment of financial time series data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24747v1,,False
Beyond Softmax: A Natural Parameterization for Categorical Random Variables,29/09/2025,"Alessandro Manenti, Cesare Alippi","Latent categorical variables are frequently found in deep learning
architectures. They can model actions in discrete reinforcement-learning
environments, represent categories in latent-variable models, or express
relations in graph neural networks. Despite their widespread use, their
discrete nature poses significant challenges to gradient-descent learning
algorithms. While a substantial body of work has offered improved gradient
estimation techniques, we take a complementary approach. Specifically, we: 1)
revisit the ubiquitous $\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its
limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the
$\textit{softmax}$ with the $\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of
a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers
significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher
Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure
learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically
show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields
models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\textit{Catnat}$
is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases.
Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques

introduce HyperHELM, a framework that implements masked language model
pre-training in hyperbolic space for mRNA sequences. Using a hybrid design with
hyperbolic layers atop Euclidean backbone, HyperHELM aligns learned
representations with the biological hierarchy defined by the relationship
between mRNA and amino acids. Across multiple multi-species datasets, it
outperforms Euclidean baselines on 9 out of 10 tasks involving property
prediction, with 10% improvement on average, and excels in out-of-distribution

match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve
model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models
rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with
annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent

Inducing Dyslexia in Vision Language Models,29/09/2025,"Melika Honarmand, Ayati Sharma, Badr AlKhamissi, Johannes Mehrer, Martin Schrimpf","Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading
difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area
in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying
dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable
insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about
the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use
large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally
identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using
stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective
units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike
ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while
general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In
particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits

PoseDiff: A Unified Diffusion Model Bridging Robot Pose Estimation and Video-to-Action Control,29/09/2025,"Haozhuo Zhang, Michele Caprio, Jing Shao, Qiang Zhang, Jian Tang, Shanghang Zhang, Wei Pan","We present PoseDiff, a conditional diffusion model that unifies robot state
estimation and control within a single framework. At its core, PoseDiff maps
raw visual observations into structured robot states-such as 3D keypoints or
joint angles-from a single RGB image, eliminating the need for multi-stage
pipelines or auxiliary modalities. Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff
extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on
sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and
continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy.
This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception

an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general
action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract
the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the
challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning
with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment
interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of
over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels. By learning behaviors
in imagination, Dreamer 4 is the first agent to obtain diamonds in Minecraft
purely from offline data, without environment interaction. Our work provides a
scalable recipe for imagination training, marking a step towards intelligent
agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24527v1,,False
Experience-guided reflective co-evolution of prompts and heuristics for automatic algorithm design,29/09/2025,"Yihong Liu, Junyi Li, Wayne Xin Zhao, Hongyu Lu, Ji-Rong Wen","Combinatorial optimization problems are traditionally tackled with
handcrafted heuristic algorithms, which demand extensive domain expertise and
significant implementation effort. Recent progress has highlighted the
potential of automatic heuristics design powered by large language models
(LLMs), enabling the automatic generation and refinement of heuristics. These
approaches typically maintain a population of heuristics and employ LLMs as
mutation operators to evolve them across generations. While effective, such
methods often risk stagnating in local optima. To address this issue, we
propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics
(EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the
island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse
heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic
algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two
problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem.
Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error
against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of
automatic algorithm design with LLMs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24509v1,,False
Sanitize Your Responses: Mitigating Privacy Leakage in Large Language Models,29/09/2025,"Wenjie Fu, Huandong Wang, Junyao Gao, Guoan Wan, Tao Jiang","As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide
range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding
the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite
significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards,
adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses.
Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering,
which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is
incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce
Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive
psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during
conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that
continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level
via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place
correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues.
This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with
negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that
privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous
studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy
leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior
mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility
of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

An Agent-Based Framework for Automated Higher-Voice Harmony Generation,29/09/2025,"Nia D'Souza Ganapathy, Arul Selvamani Shaja","The generation of musically coherent and aesthetically pleasing harmony
remains a significant challenge in the field of algorithmic composition. This
paper introduces an innovative Agentic AI-enabled Higher Harmony Music
Generator, a multi-agent system designed to create harmony in a collaborative
and modular fashion. Our framework comprises four specialized agents: a
Music-Ingestion Agent for parsing and standardizing input musical scores; a
Chord-Knowledge Agent, powered by a Chord-Former (Transformer model), to
interpret and provide the constituent notes of complex chord symbols; a
Harmony-Generation Agent, which utilizes a Harmony-GPT and a Rhythm-Net (RNN)
to compose a melodically and rhythmically complementary harmony line; and an
Audio-Production Agent that employs a GAN-based Symbolic-to-Audio Synthesizer
to render the final symbolic output into high-fidelity audio. By delegating
specific tasks to specialized agents, our system effectively mimics the
collaborative process of human musicians. This modular, agent-based approach
allows for robust data processing, deep theoretical understanding, creative
composition, and realistic audio synthesis, culminating in a system capable of
generating sophisticated and contextually appropriate higher-voice harmonies

BiHDTrans: binary hyperdimensional transformer for efficient multivariate time series classification,29/09/2025,"Jingtao Zhang, Yi Liu, Qi Shen, Changhong Wang","The proliferation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices has led to an
unprecedented volume of multivariate time series (MTS) data, requiring
efficient and accurate processing for timely decision-making in
resource-constrained edge environments. Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with
its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in
classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while
Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory
overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary
hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD
computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing
with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and
achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With
hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the
independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional
representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary
Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic
high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than
directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy.
Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains
competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing
SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as
well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional
baseline. Together, these contributions bridge the gap between the
expressiveness of Transformers and the efficiency of HD computing, enabling
accurate, scalable, and low-latency MTS classification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24425v1,,False
AXIS: Explainable Time Series Anomaly Detection with Large Language Models,29/09/2025,"Tian Lan, Hao Duong Le, Jinbo Li, Wenjun He, Meng Wang, Chenghao Liu, Chen Zhang","Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that
articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits
and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of
Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series
as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental
challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process
long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization
suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment
between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework
that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of
direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary
hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical
grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a
pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a
task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to
facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark
featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual
grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both
LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of
significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy
compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series
Vision Language Models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24378v1,,False
Evolution Strategies at Scale: LLM Fine-Tuning Beyond Reinforcement Learning,29/09/2025,"Xin Qiu, Yulu Gan, Conor F. Hayes, Qiyao Liang, Elliot Meyerson, Babak Hodjat, Risto Miikkulainen","Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for down-stream tasks is
a critical step in the AI deployment pipeline. Reinforcement learning (RL) is
arguably the most prominent fine-tuning method, contributing to the birth of
many state-of-the-art LLMs. In contrast, evolution strategies (ES), which once
showed comparable performance to RL on models with a few million parameters,
was neglected due to the pessimistic perception of its scalability to larger
models. In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for
fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES
can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL
fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency,
tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less
tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It
therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond
what current RL techniques provide. The source codes are provided at:

Towards Generalizable PDE Dynamics Forecasting via Physics-Guided Invariant Learning,29/09/2025,"Siyang Li, Yize Chen, Yan Guo, Ming Huang, Hui Xiong","Advanced deep learning-based approaches have been actively applied to
forecast the spatiotemporal physical dynamics governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs), which acts as a critical procedure in tackling many science
and engineering problems. As real-world physical environments like PDE system
parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen
out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is
of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on
discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics
trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains
deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are
still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE
dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we
first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out
that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant
across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this
two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method
termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert
architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive
experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate
iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization
capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24332v1,,False
ActiveCQ: Active Estimation of Causal Quantities,29/09/2025,"Erdun Gao, Dino Sejdinovic","Estimating causal quantities (CQs) typically requires large datasets, which
can be expensive to obtain, especially when measuring individual outcomes is
costly. This challenge highlights the importance of sample-efficient active
learning strategies. To address the narrow focus of prior work on the
conditional average treatment effect, we formalize the broader task of Actively
estimating Causal Quantities (ActiveCQ) and propose a unified framework for
this general problem. Built upon the insight that many CQs are integrals of
regression functions, our framework models the regression function with a
Gaussian Process. For the distribution component, we explore both a baseline
using explicit density estimators and a more integrated method using
conditional mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This latter
approach offers key advantages: it bypasses explicit density estimation,
operates within the same function space as the GP, and adaptively refines the
distributional model after each update. Our framework enables the principled
derivation of acquisition strategies from the CQ's posterior uncertainty; we
instantiate this principle with two utility functions based on information gain
and total variance reduction. A range of simulated and semi-synthetic
experiments demonstrate that our principled framework significantly outperforms
relevant baselines, achieving substantial gains in sample efficiency across a
variety of CQs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.24293v1,,False
Let LLMs Speak Embedding Languages: Generative Text Embeddings via Iterative Contrastive Refinement,29/09/2025,"Yu-Che Tsai, Kuan-Yu Chen, Yuan-Chi Li, Yuan-Hao Chen, Ching-Yu Tsai, Shou-De Lin","Existing large language model (LLM)-based embeddings typically adopt an
encoder-only paradigm, treating LLMs as static feature extractors and
overlooking their core generative strengths. We introduce GIRCSE (Generative
Iterative Refinement for Contrastive Sentence Embeddings), a novel framework
that leverages autoregressive generation to iteratively refine semantic
representations. By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under
contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics
that encoder-only methods often miss. To guide this process, we propose an
Iterative Contrastive Refinement (ICR) objective that encourages each
refinement step to yield better representations. Extensive experiments show
that GIRCSE outperforms strong LLM-based embedding baselines on the MTEB
benchmark and instruction-following tasks. Moreover, GIRCSE exhibits an

Graph-Based Learning of Free Surface Dynamics in Generalized Newtonian Fluids using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics,29/09/2025,"Hyo-Jin Kim, Jaekwang Kim, Hyung-Jun Park","In this study, we propose a graph neural network (GNN) model for efficiently
predicting the flow behavior of non-Newtonian fluids with free surface
dynamics. The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant
challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with
constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian
cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions.
Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as
the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult.
The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where
computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like
smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional
grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on
this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the
computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our
model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle
accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's
power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while
maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and

Uni-NTFM: A Unified Foundation Model for EEG Signal Representation Learning,29/09/2025,"Zhisheng Chen, Yingwei Zhang, Qizhen Lan, Tianyu Liu, Huacan Wang, Yi Ding, Ziyu Jia, Ronghao Chen, Kun Wang, Xinliang Zhou","Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated
significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to
electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique
properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures
designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1)
conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic
features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial
topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the
inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To
address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological
Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles
to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates
three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time,
frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain
feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes
from different international standards and generate structured input sequences
for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that
efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized
subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B
parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a
dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms

obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object
physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining
execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs
vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When
a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on
the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed
plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without
additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual
learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes
subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and
RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently
outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust

that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates
mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh

generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we
introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving
FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our
approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement
Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only
during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier
selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing,
avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23

fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning.
Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in
