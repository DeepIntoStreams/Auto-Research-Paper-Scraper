Discovering Data Structures: Nearest Neighbor Search and Beyond,05/11/2024,"Omar Salemohamed, Laurent Charlin, Shivam Garg, Vatsal Sharan, Gregory Valiant","We propose a general framework for end-to-end learning of data structures.
Our framework adapts to the underlying data distribution and provides
fine-grained control over query and space complexity. Crucially, the data
structure is learned from scratch, and does not require careful initialization
or seeding with candidate data structures/algorithms. We first apply this
framework to the problem of nearest neighbor search. In several settings, we
are able to reverse-engineer the learned data structures and query algorithms.
For 1D nearest neighbor search, the model discovers optimal distribution
(in)dependent algorithms such as binary search and variants of interpolation
search. In higher dimensions, the model learns solutions that resemble k-d
trees in some regimes, while in others, they have elements of
locality-sensitive hashing. The model can also learn useful representations of
high-dimensional data and exploit them to design effective data structures. We
also adapt our framework to the problem of estimating frequencies over a data
stream, and believe it could also be a powerful discovery tool for new
problems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03253v1,,False
Spontaneous Emergence of Agent Individuality through Social Interactions in LLM-Based Communities,05/11/2024,"Ryosuke Takata, Atsushi Masumori, Takashi Ikegami","We study the emergence of agency from scratch by using Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents. In previous studies of LLM-based agents, each agent's
characteristics, including personality and memory, have traditionally been
predefined. We focused on how individuality, such as behavior, personality, and
memory, can be differentiated from an undifferentiated state. The present LLM
agents engage in cooperative communication within a group simulation,
exchanging context-based messages in natural language. By analyzing this
multi-agent simulation, we report valuable new insights into how social norms,
cooperation, and personality traits can emerge spontaneously. This paper
demonstrates that autonomously interacting LLM-powered agents generate
hallucinations and hashtags to sustain communication, which, in turn, increases
the diversity of words within their interactions. Each agent's emotions shift
through communication, and as they form communities, the personalities of the
agents emerge and evolve accordingly. This computational modeling approach and
its findings will provide a new method for analyzing collective artificial
intelligence.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03252v1,,False
Navigating Extremes: Dynamic Sparsity in Large Output Space,05/11/2024,"Nasib Ullah, Erik Schultheis, Mike Lasby, Yani Ioannou, Rohit Babbar","In recent years, Dynamic Sparse Training (DST) has emerged as an alternative
to post-training pruning for generating efficient models. In principle, DST
allows for a more memory efficient training process, as it maintains sparsity
throughout the entire training run. However, current DST implementations fail
to capitalize on this in practice. Because sparse matrix multiplication is much
less efficient than dense matrix multiplication on GPUs, most implementations
simulate sparsity by masking weights. In this paper, we leverage recent
advances in semi-structured sparse training to apply DST in the domain of
classification with large output spaces, where memory-efficiency is paramount.
With a label space of possibly millions of candidates, the classification layer
alone will consume several gigabytes of memory. Switching from a dense to a
fixed fan-in sparse layer updated with sparse evolutionary training (SET);
however, severely hampers training convergence, especially at the largest label
spaces. We find that poor gradient flow from the sparse classifier to the dense
text encoder make it difficult to learn good input representations. By
employing an intermediate layer or adding an auxiliary training objective, we
recover most of the generalisation performance of the dense model. Overall, we
demonstrate the applicability and practical benefits of DST in a challenging
domain -- characterized by a highly skewed label distribution that differs
substantially from typical DST benchmark datasets -- which enables end-to-end
training with millions of labels on commodity hardware.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.03171v1,,False
IMUDiffusion: A Diffusion Model for Multivariate Time Series Synthetisation for Inertial Motion Capturing Systems,05/11/2024,"Heiko Oppel, Michael Munz","Kinematic sensors are often used to analyze movement behaviors in sports and
daily activities due to their ease of use and lack of spatial restrictions,
unlike video-based motion capturing systems. Still, the generation, and
especially the labeling of motion data for specific activities can be
time-consuming and costly. Additionally, many models struggle with limited
data, which limits their performance in recognizing complex movement patterns.
To address those issues, generating synthetic data can help expand the
diversity and variability. In this work, we propose IMUDiffusion, a
probabilistic diffusion model specifically designed for multivariate time
series generation. Our approach enables the generation of high-quality time
series sequences which accurately capture the dynamics of human activities.
Moreover, by joining our dataset with synthetic data, we achieve a significant
improvement in the performance of our baseline human activity classifier. In
some cases, we are able to improve the macro F1-score by almost 30%.
IMUDiffusion provides a valuable tool for generating realistic human activity
movements and enhance the robustness of models in scenarios with limited
training data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02954v1,,False
A scalable generative model for dynamical system reconstruction from neuroimaging data,05/11/2024,"Eric Volkmann, Alena Br√§ndle, Daniel Durstewitz, Georgia Koppe","Data-driven inference of the generative dynamics underlying a set of observed
time series is of growing interest in machine learning and the natural
sciences. In neuroscience, such methods promise to alleviate the need to
handcraft models based on biophysical principles and allow to automatize the
inference of inter-individual differences in brain dynamics. Recent
breakthroughs in training techniques for state space models (SSMs) specifically
geared toward dynamical systems (DS) reconstruction (DSR) enable to recover the
underlying system including its geometrical (attractor) and long-term
statistical invariants from even short time series. These techniques are based
on control-theoretic ideas, like modern variants of teacher forcing (TF), to
ensure stable loss gradient propagation while training. However, as it
currently stands, these techniques are not directly applicable to data
modalities where current observations depend on an entire history of previous
states due to a signal's filtering properties, as common in neuroscience (and
physiology more generally). Prominent examples are the blood oxygenation level
dependent (BOLD) signal in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) or
Ca$^{2+}$ imaging data. Such types of signals render the SSM's decoder model
non-invertible, a requirement for previous TF-based methods. Here, exploiting
the recent success of control techniques for training SSMs, we propose a novel
algorithm that solves this problem and scales exceptionally well with model
dimensionality and filter length. We demonstrate its efficiency in
reconstructing dynamical systems, including their state space geometry and
long-term temporal properties, from just short BOLD time series.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02949v1,,False
Time-Causal VAE: Robust Financial Time Series Generator,05/11/2024,"Beatrice Acciaio, Stephan Eckstein, Songyan Hou","We build a time-causal variational autoencoder (TC-VAE) for robust generation
of financial time series data. Our approach imposes a causality constraint on
the encoder and decoder networks, ensuring a causal transport from the real
market time series to the fake generated time series. Specifically, we prove
that the TC-VAE loss provides an upper bound on the causal Wasserstein distance
between market distributions and generated distributions. Consequently, the
TC-VAE loss controls the discrepancy between optimal values of various dynamic
stochastic optimization problems under real and generated distributions. To
further enhance the model's ability to approximate the latent representation of
the real market distribution, we integrate a RealNVP prior into the TC-VAE
framework. Finally, extensive numerical experiments show that TC-VAE achieves
promising results on both synthetic and real market data. This is done by
comparing real and generated distributions according to various statistical
distances, demonstrating the effectiveness of the generated data for downstream
financial optimization tasks, as well as showcasing that the generated data
reproduces stylized facts of real financial market data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02947v1,,False
Theoretically Guaranteed Distribution Adaptable Learning,05/11/2024,"Chao Xu, Xijia Tang, Guoqing Liu, Yuhua Qian, Chenping Hou","In many open environment applications, data are collected in the form of a
stream, which exhibits an evolving distribution over time. How to design
algorithms to track these evolving data distributions with provable guarantees,
particularly in terms of the generalization ability, remains a formidable
challenge. To handle this crucial but rarely studied problem and take a further
step toward robust artificial intelligence, we propose a novel framework called
Distribution Adaptable Learning (DAL). It enables the model to effectively
track the evolving data distributions. By Encoding Feature Marginal
Distribution Information (EFMDI), we broke the limitations of optimal transport
to characterize the environmental changes and enable model reuse across diverse
data distributions. It can enhance the reusable and evolvable properties of DAL
in accommodating evolving distributions. Furthermore, to obtain the model
interpretability, we not only analyze the generalization error bound of the
local step in the evolution process, but also investigate the generalization
error bound associated with the entire classifier trajectory of the evolution
based on the Fisher-Rao distance. For demonstration, we also present two
special cases within the framework, together with their optimizations and
convergence analyses. Experimental results over both synthetic and real-world
data distribution evolving tasks validate the effectiveness and practical
utility of the proposed framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02921v1,,False
Exploring the Interplay Between Video Generation and World Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey,05/11/2024,"Ao Fu, Yi Zhou, Tao Zhou, Yi Yang, Bojun Gao, Qun Li, Guobin Wu, Ling Shao","World models and video generation are pivotal technologies in the domain of
autonomous driving, each playing a critical role in enhancing the robustness
and reliability of autonomous systems. World models, which simulate the
dynamics of real-world environments, and video generation models, which produce
realistic video sequences, are increasingly being integrated to improve
situational awareness and decision-making capabilities in autonomous vehicles.
This paper investigates the relationship between these two technologies,
focusing on how their structural parallels, particularly in diffusion-based
models, contribute to more accurate and coherent simulations of driving
scenarios. We examine leading works such as JEPA, Genie, and Sora, which
exemplify different approaches to world model design, thereby highlighting the
lack of a universally accepted definition of world models. These diverse
interpretations underscore the field's evolving understanding of how world
models can be optimized for various autonomous driving tasks. Furthermore, this
paper discusses the key evaluation metrics employed in this domain, such as
Chamfer distance for 3D scene reconstruction and Fr\'echet Inception Distance
(FID) for assessing the quality of generated video content. By analyzing the
interplay between video generation and world models, this survey identifies
critical challenges and future research directions, emphasizing the potential
of these technologies to jointly advance the performance of autonomous driving
systems. The findings presented in this paper aim to provide a comprehensive
understanding of how the integration of video generation and world models can
drive innovation in the development of safer and more reliable autonomous
vehicles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02914v1,,False
Analyzing Poverty through Intra-Annual Time-Series: A Wavelet Transform Approach,05/11/2024,"Mohammad Kakooei, Klaudia Solska, Adel Daoud","Reducing global poverty is a key objective of the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). Achieving this requires high-frequency, granular data to capture
neighborhood-level changes, particularly in data scarce regions such as low-
and middle-income countries. To fill in the data gaps, recent computer vision
methods combining machine learning (ML) with earth observation (EO) data to
improve poverty estimation. However, while much progress have been made, they
often omit intra-annual variations, which are crucial for estimating poverty in
agriculturally dependent countries. We explored the impact of integrating
intra-annual NDVI information with annual multi-spectral data on model
accuracy. To evaluate our method, we created a simulated dataset using Landsat
imagery and nighttime light data to evaluate EO-ML methods that use
intra-annual EO data. Additionally, we evaluated our method against the
Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) dataset across Africa. Our results indicate
that integrating specific NDVI-derived features with multi-spectral data
provides valuable insights for poverty analysis, emphasizing the importance of
retaining intra-annual information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02855v1,,False
Generalization and Risk Bounds for Recurrent Neural Networks,05/11/2024,"Xuewei Cheng, Ke Huang, Shujie Ma","Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have achieved great success in the
prediction of sequential data. However, their theoretical studies are still
lagging behind because of their complex interconnected structures. In this
paper, we establish a new generalization error bound for vanilla RNNs, and
provide a unified framework to calculate the Rademacher complexity that can be
applied to a variety of loss functions. When the ramp loss is used, we show
that our bound is tighter than the existing bounds based on the same
assumptions on the Frobenius and spectral norms of the weight matrices and a
few mild conditions. Our numerical results show that our new generalization
bound is the tightest among all existing bounds in three public datasets. Our
bound improves the second tightest one by an average percentage of 13.80% and
3.01% when the $\tanh$ and ReLU activation functions are used, respectively.
Moreover, we derive a sharp estimation error bound for RNN-based estimators
obtained through empirical risk minimization (ERM) in multi-class
classification problems when the loss function satisfies a Bernstein condition.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02784v1,,False
Deep learning-based modularized loading protocol for parameter estimation of Bouc-Wen class models,05/11/2024,"Sebin Oh, Junho Song, Taeyong Kim","This study proposes a modularized deep learning-based loading protocol for
optimal parameter estimation of Bouc-Wen (BW) class models. The protocol
consists of two key components: optimal loading history construction and
CNN-based rapid parameter estimation. Each component is decomposed into
independent sub-modules tailored to distinct hysteretic behaviors-basic
hysteresis, structural degradation, and pinching effect-making the protocol
adaptable to diverse hysteresis models. Three independent CNN architectures are
developed to capture the path-dependent nature of these hysteretic behaviors.
By training these CNN architectures on diverse loading histories, minimal
loading sequences, termed \textit{loading history modules}, are identified and
then combined to construct an optimal loading history. The three CNN models,
trained on the respective loading history modules, serve as rapid parameter
estimators. Numerical evaluation of the protocol, including nonlinear time
history analysis of a 3-story steel moment frame and fragility curve
construction for a 3-story reinforced concrete frame, demonstrates that the
proposed protocol significantly reduces total analysis time while maintaining
or improving estimation accuracy. The proposed protocol can be extended to
other hysteresis models, suggesting a systematic approach for identifying
general hysteresis models.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02776v1,,False
New random projections for isotropic kernels using stable spectral distributions,05/11/2024,"Nicolas Langren√©, Xavier Warin, Pierre Gruet","Rahimi and Recht [31] introduced the idea of decomposing shift-invariant
kernels by randomly sampling from their spectral distribution. This famous
technique, known as Random Fourier Features (RFF), is in principle applicable
to any shift-invariant kernel whose spectral distribution can be identified and
simulated. In practice, however, it is usually applied to the Gaussian kernel
because of its simplicity, since its spectral distribution is also Gaussian.
Clearly, simple spectral sampling formulas would be desirable for broader
classes of kernel functions. In this paper, we propose to decompose spectral
kernel distributions as a scale mixture of $\alpha$-stable random vectors. This
provides a simple and ready-to-use spectral sampling formula for a very large
class of multivariate shift-invariant kernels, including exponential power
kernels, generalized Mat\'ern kernels, generalized Cauchy kernels, as well as
newly introduced kernels such as the Beta, Kummer, and Tricomi kernels. In
particular, we show that the spectral densities of all these kernels are scale
mixtures of the multivariate Gaussian distribution. This provides a very simple
way to modify existing Random Fourier Features software based on Gaussian
kernels to cover a much richer class of multivariate kernels. This result has
broad applications for support vector machines, kernel ridge regression,
Gaussian processes, and other kernel-based machine learning techniques for
which the random Fourier features technique is applicable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02770v1,,False
"Elliptical Wishart distributions: information geometry, maximum likelihood estimator, performance analysis and statistical learning",05/11/2024,"Imen Ayadi, Florent Bouchard, Fr√©d√©ric Pascal","This paper deals with Elliptical Wishart distributions - which generalize the
Wishart distribution - in the context of signal processing and machine
learning. Two algorithms to compute the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) are
proposed: a fixed point algorithm and a Riemannian optimization method based on
the derived information geometry of Elliptical Wishart distributions. The
existence and uniqueness of the MLE are characterized as well as the
convergence of both estimation algorithms. Statistical properties of the MLE
are also investigated such as consistency, asymptotic normality and an
intrinsic version of Fisher efficiency. On the statistical learning side, novel
classification and clustering methods are designed. For the $t$-Wishart
distribution, the performance of the MLE and statistical learning algorithms
are evaluated on both simulated and real EEG and hyperspectral data, showcasing
the interest of our proposed methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02726v1,,False
Point processes with event time uncertainty,05/11/2024,"Xiuyuan Cheng, Tingnan Gong, Yao Xie","Point processes are widely used statistical models for uncovering the
temporal patterns in dependent event data. In many applications, the event time
cannot be observed exactly, calling for the incorporation of time uncertainty
into the modeling of point process data. In this work, we introduce a framework
to model time-uncertain point processes possibly on a network. We start by
deriving the formulation in the continuous-time setting under a few assumptions
motivated by application scenarios. After imposing a time grid, we obtain a
discrete-time model that facilitates inference and can be computed by
first-order optimization methods such as Gradient Descent or Variation
inequality (VI) using batch-based Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The
parameter recovery guarantee is proved for VI inference at an $O(1/k)$
convergence rate using $k$ SGD steps. Our framework handles non-stationary
processes by modeling the inference kernel as a matrix (or tensor on a network)
and it covers the stationary process, such as the classical Hawkes process, as
a special case. We experimentally show that the proposed approach outperforms
previous General Linear model (GLM) baselines on simulated and real data and
reveals meaningful causal relations on a Sepsis-associated Derangements
dataset.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.02694v1,,False
