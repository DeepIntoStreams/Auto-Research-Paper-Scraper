TRUST: An LLM-Based Dialogue System for Trauma Understanding and Structured Assessments,30/04/2025,"Sichang Tu, Abigail Powers, Stephen Doogan, Jinho D. Choi","Objectives: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to
assist clinicians and support patients, no existing work has explored dialogue
systems for standard diagnostic interviews and assessments. This study aims to
bridge the gap in mental healthcare accessibility by developing an LLM-powered
dialogue system that replicates clinician behavior. Materials and Methods: We
introduce TRUST, a framework of cooperative LLM modules capable of conducting
formal diagnostic interviews and assessments for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD). To guide the generation of appropriate clinical responses, we propose a
Dialogue Acts schema specifically designed for clinical interviews.
Additionally, we develop a patient simulation approach based on real-life
interview transcripts to replace time-consuming and costly manual testing by
clinicians. Results: A comprehensive set of evaluation metrics is designed to
assess the dialogue system from both the agent and patient simulation
perspectives. Expert evaluations by conversation and clinical specialists show
that TRUST performs comparably to real-life clinical interviews. Discussion:
Our system performs at the level of average clinicians, with room for future
enhancements in communication styles and response appropriateness. Conclusions:
Our TRUST framework shows its potential to facilitate mental healthcare
availability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21851v1,,False
Anomaly-Driven Approach for Enhanced Prostate Cancer Segmentation,30/04/2025,"Alessia Hu, Regina Beets-Tan, Lishan Cai, Eduardo Pooch","Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays an important role in identifying
clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa), yet automated methods face
challenges such as data imbalance, variable tumor sizes, and a lack of
annotated data. This study introduces Anomaly-Driven U-Net (adU-Net), which
incorporates anomaly maps derived from biparametric MRI sequences into a deep
learning-based segmentation framework to improve csPCa identification. We
conduct a comparative analysis of anomaly detection methods and evaluate the
integration of anomaly maps into the segmentation pipeline. Anomaly maps,
generated using Fixed-Point GAN reconstruction, highlight deviations from
normal prostate tissue, guiding the segmentation model to potential cancerous
regions. We compare the performance by using the average score, computed as the
mean of the AUROC and Average Precision (AP). On the external test set, adU-Net
achieves the best average score of 0.618, outperforming the baseline nnU-Net
model (0.605). The results demonstrate that incorporating anomaly detection
into segmentation improves generalization and performance, particularly with
ADC-based anomaly maps, offering a promising direction for automated csPCa
identification.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21789v1,,False
Multi-Goal Dexterous Hand Manipulation using Probabilistic Model-based Reinforcement Learning,30/04/2025,"Yingzhuo Jiang, Wenjun Huang, Rongdun Lin, Chenyang Miao, Tianfu Sun, Yunduan Cui","This paper tackles the challenge of learning multi-goal dexterous hand
manipulation tasks using model-based Reinforcement Learning. We propose
Goal-Conditioned Probabilistic Model Predictive Control (GC-PMPC) by designing
probabilistic neural network ensembles to describe the high-dimensional
dexterous hand dynamics and introducing an asynchronous MPC policy to meet the
control frequency requirements in real-world dexterous hand systems. Extensive
evaluations on four simulated Shadow Hand manipulation scenarios with randomly
generated goals demonstrate GC-PMPC's superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines. It successfully drives a cable-driven Dexterous
hand, DexHand 021 with 12 Active DOFs and 5 tactile sensors, to learn
manipulating a cubic die to three goal poses within approximately 80 minutes of
interactions, demonstrating exceptional learning efficiency and control
performance on a cost-effective dexterous hand platform.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21585v1,,False
MF-LLM: Simulating Collective Decision Dynamics via a Mean-Field Large Language Model Framework,30/04/2025,"Qirui Mi, Mengyue Yang, Xiangning Yu, Zhiyu Zhao, Cheng Deng, Bo An, Haifeng Zhang, Xu Chen, Jun Wang","Simulating collective decision-making involves more than aggregating
individual behaviors; it arises from dynamic interactions among individuals.
While large language models (LLMs) show promise for social simulation, existing
approaches often exhibit deviations from real-world data. To address this gap,
we propose the Mean-Field LLM (MF-LLM) framework, which explicitly models the
feedback loop between micro-level decisions and macro-level population. MF-LLM
alternates between two models: a policy model that generates individual actions
based on personal states and group-level information, and a mean field model
that updates the population distribution from the latest individual decisions.
Together, they produce rollouts that simulate the evolving trajectories of
collective decision-making. To better match real-world data, we introduce
IB-Tune, a fine-tuning method for LLMs grounded in the information bottleneck
principle, which maximizes the relevance of population distributions to future
actions while minimizing redundancy with historical data. We evaluate MF-LLM on
a real-world social dataset, where it reduces KL divergence to human population
distributions by 47 percent over non-mean-field baselines, and enables accurate
trend forecasting and intervention planning. It generalizes across seven
domains and four LLM backbones, providing a scalable foundation for
high-fidelity social simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21582v1,,False
GarmentDiffusion: 3D Garment Sewing Pattern Generation with Multimodal Diffusion Transformers,30/04/2025,"Xinyu Li, Qi Yao, Yuanda Wang","Garment sewing patterns are fundamental design elements that bridge the gap
between design concepts and practical manufacturing. The generative modeling of
sewing patterns is crucial for creating diversified garments. However, existing
approaches are limited either by reliance on a single input modality or by
suboptimal generation efficiency. In this work, we present
\textbf{\textit{GarmentDiffusion}}, a new generative model capable of producing
centimeter-precise, vectorized 3D sewing patterns from multimodal inputs (text,
image, and incomplete sewing pattern). Our method efficiently encodes 3D sewing
pattern parameters into compact edge token representations, achieving a
sequence length that is $\textbf{10}\times$ shorter than that of the
autoregressive SewingGPT in DressCode. By employing a diffusion transformer, we
simultaneously denoise all edge tokens along the temporal axis, while
maintaining a constant number of denoising steps regardless of dataset-specific
edge and panel statistics. With all combination of designs of our model, the
sewing pattern generation speed is accelerated by $\textbf{100}\times$ compared
to SewingGPT. We achieve new state-of-the-art results on DressCodeData, as well
as on the largest sewing pattern dataset, namely GarmentCodeData. The project
website is available at https://shenfu-research.github.io/Garment-Diffusion/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21476v1,,False
SimPRIVE: a Simulation framework for Physical Robot Interaction with Virtual Environments,30/04/2025,"Federico Nesti, Gianluca D'Amico, Mauro Marinoni, Giorgio Buttazzo","The use of machine learning in cyber-physical systems has attracted the
interest of both industry and academia. However, no general solution has yet
been found against the unpredictable behavior of neural networks and
reinforcement learning agents. Nevertheless, the improvements of
photo-realistic simulators have paved the way towards extensive testing of
complex algorithms in different virtual scenarios, which would be expensive and
dangerous to implement in the real world.
  This paper presents SimPRIVE, a simulation framework for physical robot
interaction with virtual environments, which operates as a vehicle-in-the-loop
platform, rendering a virtual world while operating the vehicle in the real
world.
  Using SimPRIVE, any physical mobile robot running on ROS 2 can easily be
configured to move its digital twin in a virtual world built with the Unreal
Engine 5 graphic engine, which can be populated with objects, people, or other
vehicles with programmable behavior.
  SimPRIVE has been designed to accommodate custom or pre-built virtual worlds
while being light-weight to contain execution times and allow fast rendering.
Its main advantage lies in the possibility of testing complex algorithms on the
full software and hardware stack while minimizing the risks and costs of a test
campaign. The framework has been validated by testing a reinforcement learning
agent trained for obstacle avoidance on an AgileX Scout Mini rover that
navigates a virtual office environment where everyday objects and people are
placed as obstacles. The physical rover moves with no collision in an indoor
limited space, thanks to a LiDAR-based heuristic.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21454v1,,False
Wasserstein-Aitchison GAN for angular measures of multivariate extremes,30/04/2025,"Stéphane Lhaut, Holger Rootzén, Johan Segers","Economically responsible mitigation of multivariate extreme risks -- extreme
rainfall in a large area, huge variations of many stock prices, widespread
breakdowns in transportation systems -- requires estimates of the probabilities
that such risks will materialize in the future. This paper develops a new
method, Wasserstein--Aitchison Generative Adversarial Networks (WA-GAN), which
provides simulated values of future $d$-dimensional multivariate extreme events
and which hence can be used to give estimates of such probabilities. The main
hypothesis is that, after transforming the observations to the unit-Pareto
scale, their distribution is regularly varying in the sense that the
distributions of their radial and angular components (with respect to the
$L_1$-norm) converge and become asymptotically independent as the radius gets
large. The method is a combination of standard extreme value analysis modeling
of the tails of the marginal distributions with nonparametric GAN modeling of
the angular distribution. For the latter, the angular values are transformed to
Aitchison coordinates in a full $(d-1)$-dimensional linear space, and a
Wasserstein GAN is trained on these coordinates and used to generate new
values. A reverse transformation is then applied to these values and gives
simulated values on the original data scale. The method shows good performance
compared to other existing methods in the literature, both in terms of
capturing the dependence structure of the extremes in the data, as well as in
generating accurate new extremes of the data distribution. The comparison is
performed on simulated multivariate extremes from a logistic model in
dimensions up to 50 and on a 30-dimensional financial data set.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21438v1,,False
Whispers of Data: Unveiling Label Distributions in Federated Learning Through Virtual Client Simulation,30/04/2025,"Zhixuan Ma, Haichang Gao, Junxiang Huang, Ping Wang","Federated Learning enables collaborative training of a global model across
multiple geographically dispersed clients without the need for data sharing.
However, it is susceptible to inference attacks, particularly label inference
attacks.
  Existing studies on label distribution inference exhibits sensitive to the
specific settings of the victim client and typically underperforms under
defensive strategies. In this study, we propose a novel label distribution
inference attack that is stable and adaptable to various scenarios.
Specifically, we estimate the size of the victim client's dataset and construct
several virtual clients tailored to the victim client. We then quantify the
temporal generalization of each class label for the virtual clients and utilize
the variation in temporal generalization to train an inference model that
predicts the label distribution proportions of the victim client.
  We validate our approach on multiple datasets, including MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, FER2013, and AG-News. The results demonstrate the superiority of
our method compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Furthermore, our attack
remains effective even under differential privacy defense mechanisms,
underscoring its potential for real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21436v1,,False
Kernel Density Machines,30/04/2025,"Damir Filipovic, Paul Schneider","We introduce kernel density machines (KDM), a novel density ratio estimator
in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space setting. KDM applies to general
probability measures on countably generated measurable spaces without
restrictive assumptions on continuity, or the existence of a Lebesgue density.
For computational efficiency, we incorporate a low-rank approximation with
precisely controlled error that grants scalability to large-sample settings. We
provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including asymptotic consistency, a
functional central limit theorem, and finite-sample error bounds, establishing
a strong foundation for practical use. Empirical results based on simulated and
real data demonstrate the efficacy and precision of KDM.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21419v1,,False
"Nexus-Gen: A Unified Model for Image Understanding, Generation, and Editing",30/04/2025,"Hong Zhang, Zhongjie Duan, Xingjun Wang, Yingda Chen, Yuze Zhao, Yu Zhang","Unified multimodal large language models (MLLMs) aim to integrate multimodal
understanding and generation abilities through a single framework. Despite
their versatility, existing open-source unified models exhibit performance gaps
against domain-specific architectures. To bridge this gap, we present
Nexus-Gen, a unified model that synergizes the language reasoning capabilities
of LLMs with the image synthesis power of diffusion models. To align the
embedding space of the LLM and diffusion model, we conduct a dual-phase
alignment training process. (1) The autoregressive LLM learns to predict image
embeddings conditioned on multimodal inputs, while (2) the vision decoder is
trained to reconstruct high-fidelity images from these embeddings. During
training the LLM, we identified a critical discrepancy between the
autoregressive paradigm's training and inference phases, where error
accumulation in continuous embedding space severely degrades generation
quality. To avoid this issue, we introduce a prefilled autoregression strategy
that prefills input sequence with position-embedded special tokens instead of
continuous embeddings. Through dual-phase training, Nexus-Gen has developed the
integrated capability to comprehensively address the image understanding,
generation and editing tasks. All models, datasets, and codes are published at
https://github.com/modelscope/Nexus-Gen.git to facilitate further advancements
across the field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21356v1,,False
Generative QoE Modeling: A Lightweight Approach for Telecom Networks,30/04/2025,"Vinti Nayar, Kanica Sachdev, Brejesh Lall","Quality of Experience (QoE) prediction plays a crucial role in optimizing
resource management and enhancing user satisfaction across both
telecommunication and OTT services. While recent advances predominantly rely on
deep learning models, this study introduces a lightweight generative modeling
framework that balances computational efficiency, interpretability, and
predictive accuracy. By validating the use of Vector Quantization (VQ) as a
preprocessing technique, continuous network features are effectively
transformed into discrete categorical symbols, enabling integration with a
Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for temporal sequence modeling. This VQ-HMM pipeline
enhances the model's capacity to capture dynamic QoE patterns while supporting
probabilistic inference on new and unseen data. Experimental results on
publicly available time-series datasets incorporating both objective indicators
and subjective QoE scores demonstrate the viability of this approach in
real-time and resource-constrained environments, where inference latency is
also critical. The framework offers a scalable alternative to complex deep
learning methods, particularly in scenarios with limited computational
resources or where latency constraints are critical.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21353v1,,False
Power Flow Approximations for Multiphase Distribution Networks using Gaussian Processes,30/04/2025,"Daniel Glover, Parikshit Pareek, Deepjyoti Deka, Anamika Dubey","Learning-based approaches are increasingly leveraged to manage and coordinate
the operation of grid-edge resources in active power distribution networks.
Among these, model-based techniques stand out for their superior data
efficiency and robustness compared to model-free methods. However, effective
model learning requires a learning-based approximator for the underlying power
flow model. This study extends existing work by introducing a data-driven power
flow method based on Gaussian Processes (GPs) to approximate the multiphase
power flow model, by mapping net load injections to nodal voltages. Simulation
results using the IEEE 123-bus and 8500-node distribution test feeders
demonstrate that the trained GP model can reliably predict the nonlinear power
flow solutions with minimal training data. We also conduct a comparative
analysis of the training efficiency and testing performance of the proposed
GP-based power flow approximator against a deep neural network-based
approximator, highlighting the advantages of our data-efficient approach.
Results over realistic operating conditions show that despite an 85% reduction
in the training sample size (corresponding to a 92.8% improvement in training
time), GP models produce a 99.9% relative reduction in mean absolute error
compared to the baselines of deep neural networks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.21260v1,,False
