EC-Flow: Enabling Versatile Robotic Manipulation from Action-Unlabeled Videos via Embodiment-Centric Flow,08/07/2025,"Yixiang Chen, Peiyan Li, Yan Huang, Jiabing Yang, Kehan Chen, Liang Wang","Current language-guided robotic manipulation systems often require low-level
action-labeled datasets for imitation learning. While object-centric flow
prediction methods mitigate this issue, they remain limited to scenarios
involving rigid objects with clear displacement and minimal occlusion. In this
work, we present Embodiment-Centric Flow (EC-Flow), a framework that directly
learns manipulation from action-unlabeled videos by predicting
embodiment-centric flow. Our key insight is that incorporating the embodiment's
inherent kinematics significantly enhances generalization to versatile
manipulation scenarios, including deformable object handling, occlusions, and
non-object-displacement tasks. To connect the EC-Flow with language
instructions and object interactions, we further introduce a goal-alignment
module by jointly optimizing movement consistency and goal-image prediction.
Moreover, translating EC-Flow to executable robot actions only requires a
standard robot URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) file to specify
kinematic constraints across joints, which makes it easy to use in practice. We
validate EC-Flow on both simulation (Meta-World) and real-world tasks,
demonstrating its state-of-the-art performance in occluded object handling (62%
improvement), deformable object manipulation (45% improvement), and
non-object-displacement tasks (80% improvement) than prior state-of-the-art
object-centric flow methods. For more information, see our project website at

Differential Mamba,08/07/2025,"Nadav Schneider, Itamar Zimerman, Eliya Nachmani","Sequence models like Transformers and RNNs often overallocate attention to
irrelevant context, leading to noisy intermediate representations. This
degrades LLM capabilities by promoting hallucinations, weakening long-range and
retrieval abilities, and reducing robustness. Recent work has shown that
differential design can mitigate this issue in Transformers, improving their
effectiveness across various applications. In this paper, we explore whether
these techniques, originally developed for Transformers, can be applied to
Mamba, a recent architecture based on selective state-space layers that
achieves Transformer-level performance with greater efficiency. We show that a
naive adaptation of differential design to Mamba is insufficient and requires
careful architectural modifications. To address this, we introduce a novel
differential mechanism for Mamba, empirically validated on language modeling
benchmarks, demonstrating improved retrieval capabilities and superior
performance over vanilla Mamba. Finally, we conduct extensive ablation studies
and empirical analyses to justify our design choices and provide evidence that
our approach effectively mitigates the overallocation problem in Mamba-based
models. Our code is publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06204v1,,False
Safe Domain Randomization via Uncertainty-Aware Out-of-Distribution Detection and Policy Adaptation,08/07/2025,"Mohamad H. Danesh, Maxime Wabartha, Stanley Wu, Joelle Pineau, Hsiu-Chin Lin","Deploying reinforcement learning (RL) policies in real-world involves
significant challenges, including distribution shifts, safety concerns, and the
impracticality of direct interactions during policy refinement. Existing
methods, such as domain randomization (DR) and off-dynamics RL, enhance policy
robustness by direct interaction with the target domain, an inherently unsafe
practice. We propose Uncertainty-Aware RL (UARL), a novel framework that
prioritizes safety during training by addressing Out-Of-Distribution (OOD)
detection and policy adaptation without requiring direct interactions in target
domain. UARL employs an ensemble of critics to quantify policy uncertainty and
incorporates progressive environmental randomization to prepare the policy for
diverse real-world conditions. By iteratively refining over high-uncertainty
regions of the state space in simulated environments, UARL enhances robust
generalization to the target domain without explicitly training on it. We
evaluate UARL on MuJoCo benchmarks and a quadrupedal robot, demonstrating its
effectiveness in reliable OOD detection, improved performance, and enhanced
sample efficiency compared to baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06111v1,,False
Few-Shot Learning by Explicit Physics Integration: An Application to Groundwater Heat Transport,08/07/2025,"Julia Pelzer, Corn√© Verburg, Alexander Heinlein, Miriam Schulte","Machine learning methods often struggle with real-world applications in
science and engineering due to limited or low-quality training data. In this
work, the example of groundwater flow with heat transport is considered; this
corresponds to an advection-diffusion process under heterogeneous flow
conditions, that is, spatially distributed material parameters and heat
sources. Classical numerical simulations are costly and challenging due to high
spatio-temporal resolution requirements and large domains. While often
computationally more efficient, purely data-driven surrogate models face
difficulties, particularly in predicting the advection process, which is highly
sensitive to input variations and involves long-range spatial interactions.
Therefore, in this work, a Local-Global Convolutional Neural Network (LGCNN)
approach is introduced. It combines a lightweight numerical surrogate for the
transport process (global) with convolutional neural networks for the
groundwater velocity and heat diffusion processes (local). With the LGCNN, a
city-wide subsurface temperature field is modeled, involving a heterogeneous
groundwater flow field and one hundred groundwater heat pump injection points
forming interacting heat plumes over long distances. The model is first
systematically analyzed based on random subsurface input fields. Then, the
model is trained on a handful of cut-outs from a real-world subsurface map of
the Munich region in Germany, and it scales to larger cut-outs without
retraining. All datasets, our code, and trained models are published for
reproducibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06062v1,,False
Kernel Trace Distance: Quantum Statistical Metric between Measures through RKHS Density Operators,08/07/2025,"Arturo Castellanos, Anna Korba, Pavlo Mozharovskyi, Hicham Janati","Distances between probability distributions are a key component of many
statistical machine learning tasks, from two-sample testing to generative
modeling, among others. We introduce a novel distance between measures that
compares them through a Schatten norm of their kernel covariance operators. We
show that this new distance is an integral probability metric that can be
framed between a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) and a Wasserstein distance. In
particular, we show that it avoids some pitfalls of MMD, by being more
discriminative and robust to the choice of hyperparameters. Moreover, it
benefits from some compelling properties of kernel methods, that can avoid the
curse of dimensionality for their sample complexity. We provide an algorithm to
compute the distance in practice by introducing an extension of kernel matrix
for difference of distributions that could be of independent interest. Those
advantages are illustrated by robust approximate Bayesian computation under
contamination as well as particle flow simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06055v1,,False
TextPixs: Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware Attention and OCR-Guided Supervision,08/07/2025,"Syeda Anshrah Gillani, Mirza Samad Ahmed Baig, Osama Ahmed Khan, Shahid Munir Shah, Umema Mujeeb, Maheen Ali","The modern text-to-image diffusion models boom has opened a new era in
digital content production as it has proven the previously unseen ability to
produce photorealistic and stylistically diverse imagery based on the semantics
of natural-language descriptions. However, the consistent disadvantage of these
models is that they cannot generate readable, meaningful, and correctly spelled
text in generated images, which significantly limits the use of practical
purposes like advertising, learning, and creative design. This paper introduces
a new framework, namely Glyph-Conditioned Diffusion with Character-Aware
Attention (GCDA), using which a typical diffusion backbone is extended by three
well-designed modules. To begin with, the model has a dual-stream text encoder
that encodes both semantic contextual information and explicit glyph
representations, resulting in a character-aware representation of the input
text that is rich in nature. Second, an attention mechanism that is aware of
the character is proposed with a new attention segregation loss that aims to
limit the attention distribution of each character independently in order to
avoid distortion artifacts. Lastly, GCDA has an OCR-in-the-loop fine-tuning
phase, where a full text perceptual loss, directly optimises models to be
legible and accurately spell. Large scale experiments to benchmark datasets,
such as MARIO-10M and T2I-CompBench, reveal that GCDA sets a new
state-of-the-art on all metrics, with better character based metrics on text
rendering (Character Error Rate: 0.08 vs 0.21 for the previous best; Word Error
Rate: 0.15 vs 0.25), human perception, and comparable image synthesis quality
on high-fidelity (FID: 14.3).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.06033v1,,False
Generalized and Unified Equivalences between Hardness and Pseudoentropy,08/07/2025,"Lunjia Hu, Salil Vadhan","Pseudoentropy characterizations provide a quantitatively precise
demonstration of the close relationship between computational hardness and
computational randomness. We prove a unified pseudoentropy characterization
that generalizes and strengthens previous results for both uniform and
non-uniform models of computation. Our characterization holds for a general
family of entropy notions that encompasses the common notions of Shannon
entropy and min entropy as special cases. Moreover, we show that the
characterizations for different entropy notions can be simultaneously achieved
by a single, universal function that simultaneously witnesses computational
hardness and computational randomness. A key technical insight of our work is
that the notion of weight-restricted calibration from the recent literature on
algorithm fairness, along with standard computational indistinguishability
(known as multiaccuracy in the fairness literature), suffices for proving
pseudoentropy characterizations for general entropy notions. This demonstrates
the power of weight-restricted calibration to enhance the classic
Complexity-Theoretic Regularity Lemma (Trevisan, Tulsiani, and Vadhan, 2009)
and Leakage Simulation Lemma (Jetchev and Pietrzak, 2014) and allows us to
achieve an exponential improvement in the complexity dependency on the alphabet
size compared to the pseudoentropy characterizations by Casacuberta, Dwork, and
Vadhan (2024) based on the much stronger notion of multicalibration. We show
that the exponential dependency on the alphabet size is inevitable for
multicalibration as well as for the weaker notion of calibrated multiaccuracy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05972v1,,False
Psychometric Item Validation Using Virtual Respondents with Trait-Response Mediators,08/07/2025,"Sungjib Lim, Woojung Song, Eun-Ju Lee, Yohan Jo","As psychometric surveys are increasingly used to assess the traits of large
language models (LLMs), the need for scalable survey item generation suited for
LLMs has also grown. A critical challenge here is ensuring the construct
validity of generated items, i.e., whether they truly measure the intended
trait. Traditionally, this requires costly, large-scale human data collection.
To make it efficient, we present a framework for virtual respondent simulation
using LLMs. Our central idea is to account for mediators: factors through which
the same trait can give rise to varying responses to a survey item. By
simulating respondents with diverse mediators, we identify survey items that
robustly measure intended traits. Experiments on three psychological trait
theories (Big5, Schwartz, VIA) show that our mediator generation methods and
simulation framework effectively identify high-validity items. LLMs demonstrate
the ability to generate plausible mediators from trait definitions and to
simulate respondent behavior for item validation. Our problem formulation,
metrics, methodology, and dataset open a new direction for cost-effective
survey development and a deeper understanding of how LLMs replicate human-like
behavior. We will publicly release our dataset and code to support future work.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05890v1,,False
Empowering Bridge Digital Twins by Bridging the Data Gap with a Unified Synthesis Framework,08/07/2025,"Wang Wang, Mingyu Shi, Jun Jiang, Wenqian Ma, Chong Liu, Yasutaka Narazaki, Xuguang Wang","As critical transportation infrastructure, bridges face escalating challenges
from aging and deterioration, while traditional manual inspection methods
suffer from low efficiency. Although 3D point cloud technology provides a new
data-driven paradigm, its application potential is often constrained by the
incompleteness of real-world data, which results from missing labels and
scanning occlusions. To overcome the bottleneck of insufficient generalization
in existing synthetic data methods, this paper proposes a systematic framework
for generating 3D bridge data.
  This framework can automatically generate complete point clouds featuring
component-level instance annotations, high-fidelity color, and precise normal
vectors. It can be further extended to simulate the creation of diverse and
physically realistic incomplete point clouds, designed to support the training
of segmentation and completion networks, respectively. Experiments demonstrate
that a PointNet++ model trained with our synthetic data achieves a mean
Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 84.2% in real-world bridge semantic
segmentation. Concurrently, a fine-tuned KT-Net exhibits superior performance
on the component completion task.
  This research offers an innovative methodology and a foundational dataset for
the 3D visual analysis of bridge structures, holding significant implications
for advancing the automated management and maintenance of infrastructure.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05814v1,,False
An autonomous agent for auditing and improving the reliability of clinical AI models,08/07/2025,"Lukas Kuhn, Florian Buettner","The deployment of AI models in clinical practice faces a critical challenge:
models achieving expert-level performance on benchmarks can fail
catastrophically when confronted with real-world variations in medical imaging.
Minor shifts in scanner hardware, lighting or demographics can erode accuracy,
but currently reliability auditing to identify such catastrophic failure cases
before deployment is a bespoke and time-consuming process. Practitioners lack
accessible and interpretable tools to expose and repair hidden failure modes.
Here we introduce ModelAuditor, a self-reflective agent that converses with
users, selects task-specific metrics, and simulates context-dependent,
clinically relevant distribution shifts. ModelAuditor then generates
interpretable reports explaining how much performance likely degrades during
deployment, discussing specific likely failure modes and identifying root
causes and mitigation strategies. Our comprehensive evaluation across three
real-world clinical scenarios - inter-institutional variation in
histopathology, demographic shifts in dermatology, and equipment heterogeneity
in chest radiography - demonstrates that ModelAuditor is able correctly
identify context-specific failure modes of state-of-the-art models such as the
established SIIM-ISIC melanoma classifier. Its targeted recommendations recover
15-25% of performance lost under real-world distribution shift, substantially
outperforming both baseline models and state-of-the-art augmentation methods.
These improvements are achieved through a multi-agent architecture and execute
on consumer hardware in under 10 minutes, costing less than US$0.50 per audit.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05755v1,,False
LeAD: The LLM Enhanced Planning System Converged with End-to-end Autonomous Driving,08/07/2025,"Yuhang Zhang, Jiaqi Liu, Chengkai Xu, Peng Hang, Jian Sun","A principal barrier to large-scale deployment of urban autonomous driving
systems lies in the prevalence of complex scenarios and edge cases. Existing
systems fail to effectively interpret semantic information within traffic
contexts and discern intentions of other participants, consequently generating
decisions misaligned with skilled drivers' reasoning patterns. We present LeAD,
a dual-rate autonomous driving architecture integrating imitation
learning-based end-to-end (E2E) frameworks with large language model (LLM)
augmentation. The high-frequency E2E subsystem maintains real-time
perception-planning-control cycles, while the low-frequency LLM module enhances
scenario comprehension through multi-modal perception fusion with HD maps and
derives optimal decisions via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning when baseline
planners encounter capability limitations. Our experimental evaluation in the
CARLA Simulator demonstrates LeAD's superior handling of unconventional
scenarios, achieving 71 points on Leaderboard V1 benchmark, with a route
completion of 93%.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05754v1,,False
GATMesh: Clock Mesh Timing Analysis using Graph Neural Networks,08/07/2025,"Muhammad Hadir Khan, Matthew Guthaus","Clock meshes are essential in high-performance VLSI systems for minimizing
skew and handling PVT variations, but analyzing them is difficult due to
reconvergent paths, multi-source driving, and input mesh buffer skew. SPICE
simulations are accurate but slow; yet simplified models miss key effects like
slew and input skew. We propose GATMesh, a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based
framework that models the clock mesh as a graph with augmented structural and
physical features. Trained on SPICE data, GATMesh achieves high accuracy with
average delay error of 5.27ps on unseen benchmarks, while achieving speed-ups
of 47146x over multi-threaded SPICE simulation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05681v1,,False
MedGen: Unlocking Medical Video Generation by Scaling Granularly-annotated Medical Videos,08/07/2025,"Rongsheng Wang, Junying Chen, Ke Ji, Zhenyang Cai, Shunian Chen, Yunjin Yang, Benyou Wang","Recent advances in video generation have shown remarkable progress in
open-domain settings, yet medical video generation remains largely
underexplored. Medical videos are critical for applications such as clinical
training, education, and simulation, requiring not only high visual fidelity
but also strict medical accuracy. However, current models often produce
unrealistic or erroneous content when applied to medical prompts, largely due
to the lack of large-scale, high-quality datasets tailored to the medical
domain. To address this gap, we introduce MedVideoCap-55K, the first
large-scale, diverse, and caption-rich dataset for medical video generation. It
comprises over 55,000 curated clips spanning real-world medical scenarios,
providing a strong foundation for training generalist medical video generation
models. Built upon this dataset, we develop MedGen, which achieves leading
performance among open-source models and rivals commercial systems across
multiple benchmarks in both visual quality and medical accuracy. We hope our
dataset and model can serve as a valuable resource and help catalyze further
research in medical video generation. Our code and data is available at

Learnable quantum spectral filters for hybrid graph neural networks,08/07/2025,Ammar Daskin,"In this paper, we describe a parameterized quantum circuit that can be
considered as convolutional and pooling layers for graph neural networks. The
circuit incorporates the parameterized quantum Fourier circuit where the qubit
connections for the controlled gates derived from the Laplacian operator.
Specifically, we show that the eigenspace of the Laplacian operator of a graph
can be approximated by using QFT based circuit whose connections are determined
from the adjacency matrix. For an $N\times N$ Laplacian, this approach yields
an approximate polynomial-depth circuit requiring only $n=log(N)$ qubits. These
types of circuits can eliminate the expensive classical computations for
approximating the learnable functions of the Laplacian through Chebyshev
polynomial or Taylor expansions.
  Using this circuit as a convolutional layer provides an $n-$ dimensional
probability vector that can be considered as the filtered and compressed graph
signal. Therefore, the circuit along with the measurement can be considered a
very efficient convolution plus pooling layer that transforms an
$N$-dimensional signal input into $n-$dimensional signal with an exponential
compression. We then apply a classical neural network prediction head to the
output of the circuit to construct a complete graph neural network. Since the
circuit incorporates geometric structure through its graph connection-based
approach, we present graph classification results for the benchmark datasets
listed in TUDataset library. Using only [1-100] learnable parameters for the
quantum circuit and minimal classical layers (1000-5000 parameters) in a
generic setting, the obtained results are comparable to and in some cases
better than many of the baseline results, particularly for the cases when
geometric structure plays a significant role.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05640v1,,False
LLMs are Introvert,08/07/2025,"Litian Zhang, Xiaoming Zhang, Bingyu Yan, Ziyi Zhou, Bo Zhang, Zhenyu Guan, Xi Zhang, Chaozhuo Li","The exponential growth of social media and generative AI has transformed
information dissemination, fostering connectivity but also accelerating the
spread of misinformation. Understanding information propagation dynamics and
developing effective control strategies is essential to mitigate harmful
content. Traditional models, such as SIR, provide basic insights but
inadequately capture the complexities of online interactions. Advanced methods,
including attention mechanisms and graph neural networks, enhance accuracy but
typically overlook user psychology and behavioral dynamics. Large language
models (LLMs), with their human-like reasoning, offer new potential for
simulating psychological aspects of information spread. We introduce an
LLM-based simulation environment capturing agents' evolving attitudes,
emotions, and responses. Initial experiments, however, revealed significant
gaps between LLM-generated behaviors and authentic human dynamics, especially
in stance detection and psychological realism. A detailed evaluation through
Social Information Processing Theory identified major discrepancies in
goal-setting and feedback evaluation, stemming from the lack of emotional
processing in standard LLM training. To address these issues, we propose the
Social Information Processing-based Chain of Thought (SIP-CoT) mechanism
enhanced by emotion-guided memory. This method improves the interpretation of
social cues, personalization of goals, and evaluation of feedback. Experimental
results confirm that SIP-CoT-enhanced LLM agents more effectively process
social information, demonstrating behaviors, attitudes, and emotions closer to
real human interactions. In summary, this research highlights critical
limitations in current LLM-based propagation simulations and demonstrates how
integrating SIP-CoT and emotional memory significantly enhances the social
intelligence and realism of LLM agents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05638v1,,False
Preemptive Solving of Future Problems: Multitask Preplay in Humans and Machines,08/07/2025,"Wilka Carvalho, Sam Hall-McMaster, Honglak Lee, Samuel J. Gershman","Humans can pursue a near-infinite variety of tasks, but typically can only
pursue a small number at the same time. We hypothesize that humans leverage
experience on one task to preemptively learn solutions to other tasks that were
accessible but not pursued. We formalize this idea as Multitask Preplay, a
novel algorithm that replays experience on one task as the starting point for
""preplay"" -- counterfactual simulation of an accessible but unpursued task.
Preplay is used to learn a predictive representation that can support fast,
adaptive task performance later on. We first show that, compared to traditional
planning and predictive representation methods, multitask preplay better
predicts how humans generalize to tasks that were accessible but not pursued in
a small grid-world, even when people didn't know they would need to generalize
to these tasks. We then show these predictions generalize to Craftax, a
partially observable 2D Minecraft environment. Finally, we show that Multitask
Preplay enables artificial agents to learn behaviors that transfer to novel
Craftax worlds sharing task co-occurrence structure. These findings demonstrate
that Multitask Preplay is a scalable theory of how humans counterfactually
learn and generalize across multiple tasks; endowing artificial agents with the
same capacity can significantly improve their performance in challenging
multitask environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.05561v1,,False
