VAMOS: A Hierarchical Vision-Language-Action Model for Capability-Modulated and Steerable Navigation,23/10/2025,"Mateo Guaman Castro, Sidharth Rajagopal, Daniel Gorbatov, Matt Schmittle, Rohan Baijal, Octi Zhang, Rosario Scalise, Sidharth Talia, Emma Romig, Celso de Melo, Byron Boots, Abhishek Gupta","A fundamental challenge in robot navigation lies in learning policies that
generalize across diverse environments while conforming to the unique physical
constraints and capabilities of a specific embodiment (e.g., quadrupeds can
walk up stairs, but rovers cannot). We propose VAMOS, a hierarchical VLA that
decouples semantic planning from embodiment grounding: a generalist planner
learns from diverse, open-world data, while a specialist affordance model
learns the robot's physical constraints and capabilities in safe, low-cost
simulation. We enabled this separation by carefully designing an interface that
lets a high-level planner propose candidate paths directly in image space that
the affordance model then evaluates and re-ranks. Our real-world experiments
show that VAMOS achieves higher success rates in both indoor and complex
outdoor navigation than state-of-the-art model-based and end-to-end learning
methods. We also show that our hierarchical design enables cross-embodied
navigation across legged and wheeled robots and is easily steerable using
natural language. Real-world ablations confirm that the specialist model is key
to embodiment grounding, enabling a single high-level planner to be deployed
across physically distinct wheeled and legged robots. Finally, this model
significantly enhances single-robot reliability, achieving 3X higher success
rates by rejecting physically infeasible plans. Website:

Video Prediction of Dynamic Physical Simulations With Pixel-Space Spatiotemporal Transformers,23/10/2025,"Dean L Slack, G Thomas Hudson, Thomas Winterbottom, Noura Al Moubayed","Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20807v1,10.1109/TNNLS.2025.3585949,False
Simple Context Compression: Mean-Pooling and Multi-Ratio Training,23/10/2025,"Yair Feldman, Yoav Artzi","A common strategy to reduce the computational costs of using long contexts in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with large language models (LLMs) is soft
context compression, where the input sequence is transformed into a shorter
continuous representation. We develop a lightweight and simple mean-pooling
approach that consistently outperforms the widely used compression-tokens
architecture, and study training the same compressor to output multiple
compression ratios. We conduct extensive experiments across in-domain and
out-of-domain QA datasets, as well as across model families, scales, and
compression ratios. Overall, our simple mean-pooling approach achieves the
strongest performance, with a relatively small drop when training for multiple
compression ratios. More broadly though, across architectures and training
regimes the trade-offs are more nuanced, illustrating the complex landscape of
compression methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20797v1,,False
FieldGen: From Teleoperated Pre-Manipulation Trajectories to Field-Guided Data Generation,23/10/2025,"Wenhao Wang, Kehe Ye, Xinyu Zhou, Tianxing Chen, Cao Min, Qiaoming Zhu, Xiaokang Yang, Yongjian Shen, Yang Yang, Maoqing Yao, Yao Mu","Large-scale and diverse datasets are vital for training robust robotic
manipulation policies, yet existing data collection methods struggle to balance
scale, diversity, and quality. Simulation offers scalability but suffers from
sim-to-real gaps, while teleoperation yields high-quality demonstrations with
limited diversity and high labor cost. We introduce FieldGen, a field-guided
data generation framework that enables scalable, diverse, and high-quality
real-world data collection with minimal human supervision. FieldGen decomposes
manipulation into two stages: a pre-manipulation phase, allowing trajectory
diversity, and a fine manipulation phase requiring expert precision. Human
demonstrations capture key contact and pose information, after which an
attraction field automatically generates diverse trajectories converging to
successful configurations. This decoupled design combines scalable trajectory
diversity with precise supervision. Moreover, FieldGen-Reward augments
generated data with reward annotations to further enhance policy learning.
Experiments demonstrate that policies trained with FieldGen achieve higher
success rates and improved stability compared to teleoperation-based baselines,
while significantly reducing human effort in long-term real-world data
collection. Webpage is available at https://fieldgen.github.io/.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20774v1,,False
Reinforcement Learning and Consumption-Savings Behavior,23/10/2025,Brandon Kaplowitz,"This paper demonstrates how reinforcement learning can explain two puzzling
empirical patterns in household consumption behavior during economic downturns.
I develop a model where agents use Q-learning with neural network approximation
to make consumption-savings decisions under income uncertainty, departing from
standard rational expectations assumptions. The model replicates two key
findings from recent literature: (1) unemployed households with previously low
liquid assets exhibit substantially higher marginal propensities to consume
(MPCs) out of stimulus transfers compared to high-asset households (0.50 vs
0.34), even when neither group faces borrowing constraints, consistent with
Ganong et al. (2024); and (2) households with more past unemployment
experiences maintain persistently lower consumption levels after controlling
for current economic conditions, a ""scarring"" effect documented by Malmendier
and Shen (2024). Unlike existing explanations based on belief updating about
income risk or ex-ante heterogeneity, the reinforcement learning mechanism
generates both higher MPCs and lower consumption levels simultaneously through
value function approximation errors that evolve with experience. Simulation
results closely match the empirical estimates, suggesting that adaptive
learning through reinforcement learning provides a unifying framework for
understanding how past experiences shape current consumption behavior beyond
what current economic conditions would predict.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20748v1,,False
Unsupervised Anomaly Prediction with N-BEATS and Graph Neural Network in Multi-variate Semiconductor Process Time Series,23/10/2025,"Daniel Sorensen, Bappaditya Dey, Minjin Hwang, Sandip Halder","Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20718v1,,False
Separating the what and how of compositional computation to enable reuse and continual learning,23/10/2025,"Haozhe Shan, Sun Minni, Lea Duncker","The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20709v1,,False
Fusing Narrative Semantics for Financial Volatility Forecasting,23/10/2025,"Yaxuan Kong, Yoontae Hwang, Marcus Kaiser, Chris Vryonides, Roel Oomen, Stefan Zohren","We introduce M2VN: Multi-Modal Volatility Network, a novel deep
learning-based framework for financial volatility forecasting that unifies time
series features with unstructured news data. M2VN leverages the
representational power of deep neural networks to address two key challenges in
this domain: (i) aligning and fusing heterogeneous data modalities, numerical
financial data and textual information, and (ii) mitigating look-ahead bias
that can undermine the validity of financial models. To achieve this, M2VN
combines open-source market features with news embeddings generated by Time
Machine GPT, a recently introduced point-in-time LLM, ensuring temporal
integrity. An auxiliary alignment loss is introduced to enhance the integration
of structured and unstructured data within the deep learning architecture.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that M2VN consistently outperforms existing
baselines, underscoring its practical value for risk management and financial
decision-making in dynamic markets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20699v1,,False
Towards the Formalization of a Trustworthy AI for Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms,23/10/2025,"Riccardo Guidotti, Martina Cinquini, Marta Marchiori Manerba, Mattia Setzu, Francesco Spinnato","Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20621v1,,False
OnlineSplatter: Pose-Free Online 3D Reconstruction for Free-Moving Objects,23/10/2025,"Mark He Huang, Lin Geng Foo, Christian Theobalt, Ying Sun, De Wen Soh","Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory
and runtime.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20605v1,,False
Blur2seq: Blind Deblurring and Camera Trajectory Estimation from a Single Camera Motion-blurred Image,23/10/2025,"Guillermo Carbajal, Andrés Almansa, Pablo Musé","Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Hierarchical Sequence Iteration for Heterogeneous Question Answering,23/10/2025,"Ruiyi Yang, Hao Xue, Imran Razzak, Hakim Hacid, Flora D. Salim","Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) remains brittle on multi-step questions
and heterogeneous evidence sources, trading accuracy against latency and
token/tool budgets. This paper introducesHierarchical Sequence (HSEQ) Iteration
for Heterogeneous Question Answering, a unified framework that (i) linearize
documents, tables, and knowledge graphs into a reversible hierarchical sequence
with lightweight structural tags, and (ii) perform structure-aware iteration to
collect just-enough evidence before answer synthesis. A Head Agent provides
guidance that leads retrieval, while an Iteration Agent selects and expands
HSeq via structure-respecting actions (e.g., parent/child hops, table
row/column neighbors, KG relations); Finally the head agent composes
canonicalized evidence to genearte the final answer, with an optional
refinement loop to resolve detected contradictions. Experiments on HotpotQA
(text), HybridQA/TAT-QA (table+text), and MetaQA (KG) show consistent EM/F1
gains over strong single-pass, multi-hop, and agentic RAG baselines with high
efficiency. Besides, HSEQ exhibits three key advantages: (1) a format-agnostic
unification that enables a single policy to operate across text, tables, and
KGs without per-dataset specialization; (2) guided, budget-aware iteration that
reduces unnecessary hops, tool calls, and tokens while preserving accuracy; and
(3) evidence canonicalization for reliable QA, improving answers consistency
and auditability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20505v1,,False
Learning Decentralized Routing Policies via Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning in Lunar Delay-Tolerant Networks,23/10/2025,"Federico Lozano-Cuadra, Beatriz Soret, Marc Sanchez Net, Abhishek Cauligi, Federico Rossi","We present a fully decentralized routing framework for multi-robot
exploration missions operating under the constraints of a Lunar Delay-Tolerant
Network (LDTN). In this setting, autonomous rovers must relay collected data to
a lander under intermittent connectivity and unknown mobility patterns. We
formulate the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Problem (POMDP)
and propose a Graph Attention-based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(GAT-MARL) policy that performs Centralized Training, Decentralized Execution
(CTDE). Our method relies only on local observations and does not require
global topology updates or packet replication, unlike classical approaches such
as shortest path and controlled flooding-based algorithms. Through Monte Carlo
simulations in randomized exploration environments, GAT-MARL provides higher
delivery rates, no duplications, and fewer packet losses, and is able to
leverage short-term mobility forecasts; offering a scalable solution for future
space robotic systems for planetary exploration, as demonstrated by successful
generalization to larger rover teams.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20436v1,,False
Identification and Debiased Learning of Causal Effects with General Instrumental Variables,23/10/2025,"Shuyuan Chen, Peng Zhang, Yifan Cui","Instrumental variable methods are fundamental to causal inference when
treatment assignment is confounded by unobserved variables. In this article, we
develop a general nonparametric framework for identification and learning with
multi-categorical or continuous instrumental variables. Specifically, we
propose an additive instrumental variable framework to identify mean potential
outcomes and the average treatment effect with a weighting function. Leveraging
semiparametric theory, we derive efficient influence functions and construct
consistent, asymptotically normal estimators via debiased machine learning.
Extensions to longitudinal data, dynamic treatment regimes, and multiplicative
instrumental variables are further developed. We demonstrate the proposed
method by employing simulation studies and analyzing real data from the Job
Training Partnership Act program.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20404v1,,False
Hierarchical Time Series Forecasting with Robust Reconciliation,23/10/2025,"Shuhei Aikawa, Aru Suzuki, Kei Yoshitake, Kanata Teshigawara, Akira Iwabuchi, Ken Kobayashi, Kazuhide Nakata","This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20383v1,,False
Synthetic Data for Robust Runway Detection,23/10/2025,"Estelle Chigot, Dennis G. Wilson, Meriem Ghrib, Fabrice Jimenez, Thomas Oberlin","Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20349v1,10.1007/978-3-032-04968-1_25,False
InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling,23/10/2025,Yuhang Wang,"Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20302v1,,False
Using Large Language Models for Abstraction of Planning Domains - Extended Version,23/10/2025,"Bita Banihashemi, Megh Patel, Yves Lespérance","Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20258v1,,False
Individualized Cognitive Simulation in Large Language Models: Evaluating Different Cognitive Representation Methods,23/10/2025,"Tianyi Zhang, Xiaolin Zhou, Yunzhe Wang, Erik Cambria, David Traum, Rui Mao","Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20252v1,,False
Compositional Generation for Long-Horizon Coupled PDEs,23/10/2025,"Somayajulu L. N. Dhulipala, Deep Ray, Nicholas Forman","Simulating coupled PDE systems is computationally intensive, and prior
efforts have largely focused on training surrogates on the joint (coupled)
data, which requires a large amount of data. In the paper, we study
compositional diffusion approaches where diffusion models are only trained on
the decoupled PDE data and are composed at inference time to recover the
coupled field. Specifically, we investigate whether the compositional strategy
can be feasible under long time horizons involving a large number of time
steps. In addition, we compare a baseline diffusion model with that trained
using the v-parameterization strategy. We also introduce a symmetric
compositional scheme for the coupled fields based on the Euler scheme. We
evaluate on Reaction-Diffusion and modified Burgers with longer time grids, and
benchmark against a Fourier Neural Operator trained on coupled data. Despite
seeing only decoupled training data, the compositional diffusion models recover
coupled trajectories with low error. v-parameterization can improve accuracy
over a baseline diffusion model, while the neural operator surrogate remains
strongest given that it is trained on the coupled data. These results show that
compositional diffusion is a viable strategy towards efficient, long-horizon
modeling of coupled PDEs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.20141v1,,False
