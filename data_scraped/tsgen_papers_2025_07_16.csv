Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification,15/07/2025,"Andrey Bryutkin, Matthew E. Levine, IÃ±igo Urteaga, Youssef Marzouk","Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system
identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting
complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We
solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the
Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal
parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer
functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while
resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful,
structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures
conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and
frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms.
Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over
standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational
efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide
robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11535v1,,False
Elk: Exploring the Efficiency of Inter-core Connected AI Chips with Deep Learning Compiler Techniques,15/07/2025,"Yiqi Liu, Yuqi Xue, Noelle Crawford, Jilong Xue, Jian Huang","To meet the increasing demand of deep learning (DL) models, AI chips are
employing both off-chip memory (e.g., HBM) and high-bandwidth low-latency
interconnect for direct inter-core data exchange. However, it is not easy to
explore the efficiency of these inter-core connected AI (ICCA) chips, due to a
fundamental tussle among compute (per-core execution), communication
(inter-core data exchange), and I/O (off-chip data access).
  In this paper, we develop Elk, a DL compiler framework to maximize the
efficiency of ICCA chips by jointly trading off all the three performance
factors discussed above. Elk structures these performance factors into
configurable parameters and forms a global trade-off space in the DL compiler.
To systematically explore this space and maximize overall efficiency, Elk
employs a new inductive operator scheduling policy and a cost-aware on-chip
memory allocation algorithm. It generates globally optimized execution plans
that best overlap off-chip data loading and on-chip execution. To examine the
efficiency of Elk, we build a full-fledged emulator based on a real ICCA chip
IPU-POD4, and an ICCA chip simulator for sensitivity analysis with different
interconnect network topologies. Elk achieves 94% of the ideal roofline
performance of ICCA chips on average, showing the benefits of supporting large
DL models on ICCA chips. We also show Elk's capability of enabling architecture
design space exploration for new ICCA chip development.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11506v1,,False
D3FL: Data Distribution and Detrending for Robust Federated Learning in Non-linear Time-series Data,15/07/2025,"Harsha Varun Marisetty, Manik Gupta, Yogesh Simmhan","With advancements in computing and communication technologies, the Internet
of Things (IoT) has seen significant growth. IoT devices typically collect data
from various sensors, such as temperature, humidity, and energy meters. Much of
this data is temporal in nature. Traditionally, data from IoT devices is
centralized for analysis, but this approach introduces delays and increased
communication costs. Federated learning (FL) has emerged as an effective
alternative, allowing for model training across distributed devices without the
need to centralize data. In many applications, such as smart home energy and
environmental monitoring, the data collected by IoT devices across different
locations can exhibit significant variation in trends and seasonal patterns.
Accurately forecasting such non-stationary, non-linear time-series data is
crucial for applications like energy consumption estimation and weather
forecasting. However, these data variations can severely impact prediction
accuracy. The key contributions of this paper are: (1) Investigating how
non-linear, non-stationary time-series data distributions, like generalized
extreme value (gen-extreme) and log norm distributions, affect FL performance.
(2) Analyzing how different detrending techniques for non-linear time-series
data influence the forecasting model's performance in a FL setup. We generated
several synthetic time-series datasets using non-linear data distributions and
trained an LSTM-based forecasting model using both centralized and FL
approaches. Additionally, we evaluated the impact of detrending on real-world
datasets with non-linear time-series data distributions. Our experimental
results show that: (1) FL performs worse than centralized approaches when
dealing with non-linear data distributions. (2) The use of appropriate
detrending techniques improves FL performance, reducing loss across different
data distributions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11471v1,,False
Data Augmentation in Time Series Forecasting through Inverted Framework,15/07/2025,"Hongming Tan, Ting Chen, Ruochong Jin, Wai Kin Chan","Currently, iTransformer is one of the most popular and effective models for
multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting. Thanks to its inverted framework,
iTransformer effectively captures multivariate correlation. However, the
inverted framework still has some limitations. It diminishes temporal
interdependency information, and introduces noise in cases of nonsignificant
variable correlation. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel data
augmentation method on inverted framework, called DAIF. Unlike previous data
augmentation methods, DAIF stands out as the first real-time augmentation
specifically designed for the inverted framework in MTS forecasting. We first
define the structure of the inverted sequence-to-sequence framework, then
propose two different DAIF strategies, Frequency Filtering and Cross-variation
Patching to address the existing challenges of the inverted framework.
Experiments across multiple datasets and inverted models have demonstrated the
effectiveness of our DAIF.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11439v1,,False
CogDDN: A Cognitive Demand-Driven Navigation with Decision Optimization and Dual-Process Thinking,15/07/2025,"Yuehao Huang, Liang Liu, Shuangming Lei, Yukai Ma, Hao Su, Jianbiao Mei, Pengxiang Zhao, Yaqing Gu, Yong Liu, Jiajun Lv","Mobile robots are increasingly required to navigate and interact within
unknown and unstructured environments to meet human demands. Demand-driven
navigation (DDN) enables robots to identify and locate objects based on
implicit human intent, even when object locations are unknown. However,
traditional data-driven DDN methods rely on pre-collected data for model
training and decision-making, limiting their generalization capability in
unseen scenarios. In this paper, we propose CogDDN, a VLM-based framework that
emulates the human cognitive and learning mechanisms by integrating fast and
slow thinking systems and selectively identifying key objects essential to
fulfilling user demands. CogDDN identifies appropriate target objects by
semantically aligning detected objects with the given instructions.
Furthermore, it incorporates a dual-process decision-making module, comprising
a Heuristic Process for rapid, efficient decisions and an Analytic Process that
analyzes past errors, accumulates them in a knowledge base, and continuously
improves performance. Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning strengthens the
decision-making process. Extensive closed-loop evaluations on the AI2Thor
simulator with the ProcThor dataset show that CogDDN outperforms single-view
camera-only methods by 15%, demonstrating significant improvements in
navigation accuracy and adaptability. The project page is available at

Generative Click-through Rate Prediction with Applications to Search Advertising,15/07/2025,"Lingwei Kong, Lu Wang, Changping Peng, Zhangang Lin, Ching Law, Jingping Shao","Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction models are integral to a myriad of
industrial settings, such as personalized search advertising. Current methods
typically involve feature extraction from users' historical behavior sequences
combined with product information, feeding into a discriminative model that is
trained on user feedback to estimate CTR. With the success of models such as
GPT, the potential for generative models to enrich expressive power beyond
discriminative models has become apparent. In light of this, we introduce a
novel model that leverages generative models to enhance the precision of CTR
predictions in discriminative models. To reconcile the disparate data
aggregation needs of both model types, we design a two-stage training process:
1) Generative pre-training for next-item prediction with the given item
category in user behavior sequences; 2) Fine-tuning the well-trained generative
model within a discriminative CTR prediction framework. Our method's efficacy
is substantiated through extensive experiments on a new dataset, and its
significant utility is further corroborated by online A/B testing results.
Currently, the model is deployed on one of the world's largest e-commerce
platforms, and we intend to release the associated code and dataset in the
future.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11246v1,,False
Role-Playing LLM-Based Multi-Agent Support Framework for Detecting and Addressing Family Communication Bias,15/07/2025,"Rushia Harada, Yuken Kimura, Keito Inoshita","Well-being in family settings involves subtle psychological dynamics that
conventional metrics often overlook. In particular, unconscious parental
expectations, termed ideal parent bias, can suppress children's emotional
expression and autonomy. This suppression, referred to as suppressed emotion,
often stems from well-meaning but value-driven communication, which is
difficult to detect or address from outside the family. Focusing on these
latent dynamics, this study explores Large Language Model (LLM)-based support
for psychologically safe family communication. We constructed a Japanese
parent-child dialogue corpus of 30 scenarios, each annotated with metadata on
ideal parent bias and suppressed emotion. Based on this corpus, we developed a
Role-Playing LLM-based multi-agent dialogue support framework that analyzes
dialogue and generates feedback. Specialized agents detect suppressed emotion,
describe implicit ideal parent bias in parental speech, and infer contextual
attributes such as the child's age and background. A meta-agent compiles these
outputs into a structured report, which is then passed to five selected expert
agents. These agents collaboratively generate empathetic and actionable
feedback through a structured four-step discussion process. Experiments show
that the system can detect categories of suppressed emotion with moderate
accuracy and produce feedback rated highly in empathy and practicality.
Moreover, simulated follow-up dialogues incorporating this feedback exhibited
signs of improved emotional expression and mutual understanding, suggesting the
framework's potential in supporting positive transformation in family
interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11210v1,,False
Recent Advances in Simulation-based Inference for Gravitational Wave Data Analysis,15/07/2025,"Bo Liang, He Wang","The detection of gravitational waves by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaboration
has ushered in a new era of observational astronomy, emphasizing the need for
rapid and detailed parameter estimation and population-level analyses.
Traditional Bayesian inference methods, particularly Markov chain Monte Carlo,
face significant computational challenges when dealing with the
high-dimensional parameter spaces and complex noise characteristics inherent in
gravitational wave data. This review examines the emerging role of
simulation-based inference methods in gravitational wave astronomy, with a
focus on approaches that leverage machine-learning techniques such as
normalizing flows and neural posterior estimation. We provide a comprehensive
overview of the theoretical foundations underlying various simulation-based
inference methods, including neural posterior estimation, neural ratio
estimation, neural likelihood estimation, flow matching, and consistency
models. We explore the applications of these methods across diverse
gravitational wave data processing scenarios, from single-source parameter
estimation and overlapping signal analysis to testing general relativity and
conducting population studies. Although these techniques demonstrate speed
improvements over traditional methods in controlled studies, their
model-dependent nature and sensitivity to prior assumptions are barriers to
their widespread adoption. Their accuracy, which is similar to that of
conventional methods, requires further validation across broader parameter
spaces and noise conditions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11192v1,10.61977/ati2025020,False
Standards-Compliant DM-RS Allocation via Temporal Channel Prediction for Massive MIMO Systems,15/07/2025,"Sehyun Ryu, Hyun Jong Yang","Reducing feedback overhead in beyond 5G networks is a critical challenge, as
the growing number of antennas in modern massive MIMO systems substantially
increases the channel state information (CSI) feedback demand in frequency
division duplex (FDD) systems. To address this, extensive research has focused
on CSI compression and prediction, with neural network-based approaches gaining
momentum and being considered for integration into the 3GPP 5G-Advanced
standards. While deep learning has been effectively applied to CSI-limited
beamforming and handover optimization, reference signal allocation under such
constraints remains surprisingly underexplored. To fill this gap, we introduce
the concept of channel prediction-based reference signal allocation (CPRS),
which jointly optimizes channel prediction and DM-RS allocation to improve data
throughput without requiring CSI feedback. We further propose a
standards-compliant ViViT/CNN-based architecture that implements CPRS by
treating evolving CSI matrices as sequential image-like data, enabling
efficient and adaptive transmission in dynamic environments. Simulation results
using ray-tracing channel data generated in NVIDIA Sionna validate the proposed
method, showing up to 36.60% throughput improvement over benchmark strategies.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11064v1,,False
Personalized Exercise Recommendation with Semantically-Grounded Knowledge Tracing,15/07/2025,"Yilmazcan Ozyurt, Tunaberk Almaci, Stefan Feuerriegel, Mrinmaya Sachan","We introduce ExRec, a general framework for personalized exercise
recommendation with semantically-grounded knowledge tracing. Our method builds
on the observation that existing exercise recommendation approaches simulate
student performance via knowledge tracing (KT) but they often overlook two key
aspects: (a) the semantic content of questions and (b) the sequential,
structured progression of student learning. To address this, our ExRec presents
an end-to-end pipeline, from annotating the KCs of questions and learning their
semantic representations to training KT models and optimizing several
reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Moreover, we improve standard
Q-learning-based continuous RL methods via a tailored model-based value
estimation (MVE) approach that directly leverages the components of KT model in
estimating cumulative knowledge improvement. We validate the effectiveness of
our ExRec using various RL methods across four real-world tasks with different
educational goals in online math learning. We further show that ExRec
generalizes robustly to new, unseen questions and that it produces
interpretable student learning trajectories. Together, our findings highlight
the promise of KT-guided RL for effective personalization in education.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.11060v1,,False
Diffusion Decoding for Peptide De Novo Sequencing,15/07/2025,"Chi-en Amy Tai, Alexander Wong","Peptide de novo sequencing is a method used to reconstruct amino acid
sequences from tandem mass spectrometry data without relying on existing
protein sequence databases. Traditional deep learning approaches, such as
Casanovo, mainly utilize autoregressive decoders and predict amino acids
sequentially. Subsequently, they encounter cascading errors and fail to
leverage high-confidence regions effectively. To address these issues, this
paper investigates using diffusion decoders adapted for the discrete data
domain. These decoders provide a different approach, allowing sequence
generation to start from any peptide segment, thereby enhancing prediction
accuracy. We experiment with three different diffusion decoder designs,
knapsack beam search, and various loss functions. We find knapsack beam search
did not improve performance metrics and simply replacing the transformer
decoder with a diffusion decoder lowered performance. Although peptide
precision and recall were still 0, the best diffusion decoder design with the
DINOISER loss function obtained a statistically significant improvement in
amino acid recall by 0.373 compared to the baseline autoregressive
decoder-based Casanovo model. These findings highlight the potential of
diffusion decoders to not only enhance model sensitivity but also drive
significant advancements in peptide de novo sequencing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10955v1,,False
Enhancing Safe and Controllable Protein Generation via Knowledge Preference Optimization,15/07/2025,"Yuhao Wang, Keyan Ding, Kehua Feng, Zeyuan Wang, Ming Qin, Xiaotong Li, Qiang Zhang, Huajun Chen","Protein language models have emerged as powerful tools for sequence
generation, offering substantial advantages in functional optimization and
denovo design. However, these models also present significant risks of
generating harmful protein sequences, such as those that enhance viral
transmissibility or evade immune responses. These concerns underscore critical
biosafety and ethical challenges. To address these issues, we propose a
Knowledge-guided Preference Optimization (KPO) framework that integrates prior
knowledge via a Protein Safety Knowledge Graph. This framework utilizes an
efficient graph pruning strategy to identify preferred sequences and employs
reinforcement learning to minimize the risk of generating harmful proteins.
Experimental results demonstrate that KPO effectively reduces the likelihood of
producing hazardous sequences while maintaining high functionality, offering a
robust safety assurance framework for applying generative models in
biotechnology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10923v1,,False
Lessons Learned from Evaluation of LLM based Multi-agents in Safer Therapy Recommendation,15/07/2025,"Yicong Wu, Ting Chen, Irit Hochberg, Zhoujian Sun, Ruth Edry, Zhengxing Huang, Mor Peleg","Therapy recommendation for chronic patients with multimorbidity is
challenging due to risks of treatment conflicts. Existing decision support
systems face scalability limitations. Inspired by the way in which general
practitioners (GP) manage multimorbidity patients, occasionally convening
multidisciplinary team (MDT) collaboration, this study investigated the
feasibility and value of using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based multi-agent
system (MAS) for safer therapy recommendations. We designed a single agent and
a MAS framework simulating MDT decision-making by enabling discussion among LLM
agents to resolve medical conflicts. The systems were evaluated on therapy
planning tasks for multimorbidity patients using benchmark cases. We compared
MAS performance with single-agent approaches and real-world benchmarks. An
important contribution of our study is the definition of evaluation metrics
that go beyond the technical precision and recall and allow the inspection of
clinical goals met and medication burden of the proposed advices to a gold
standard benchmark. Our results show that with current LLMs, a single agent GP
performs as well as MDTs. The best-scoring models provide correct
recommendations that address all clinical goals, yet the advices are
incomplete. Some models also present unnecessary medications, resulting in
unnecessary conflicts between medication and conditions or drug-drug
interactions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10911v1,,False
Commuting Distance Regularization for Timescale-Dependent Label Inconsistency in EEG Emotion Recognition,15/07/2025,"Xiaocong Zeng, Craig Michoski, Yan Pang, Dongyang Kuang","In this work, we address the often-overlooked issue of Timescale Dependent
Label Inconsistency (TsDLI) in training neural network models for EEG-based
human emotion recognition. To mitigate TsDLI and enhance model generalization
and explainability, we propose two novel regularization strategies: Local
Variation Loss (LVL) and Local-Global Consistency Loss (LGCL). Both methods
incorporate classical mathematical principles--specifically, functions of
bounded variation and commute-time distances--within a graph theoretic
framework. Complementing our regularizers, we introduce a suite of new
evaluation metrics that better capture the alignment between temporally local
predictions and their associated global emotion labels. We validate our
approach through comprehensive experiments on two widely used EEG emotion
datasets, DREAMER and DEAP, across a range of neural architectures including
LSTM and transformer-based models. Performance is assessed using five distinct
metrics encompassing both quantitative accuracy and qualitative consistency.
Results consistently show that our proposed methods outperform state-of-the-art
baselines, delivering superior aggregate performance and offering a principled
trade-off between interpretability and predictive power under label
inconsistency. Notably, LVL achieves the best aggregate rank across all
benchmarked backbones and metrics, while LGCL frequently ranks the second,
highlighting the effectiveness of our framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10895v1,,False
Learning from Imperfect Data: Robust Inference of Dynamic Systems using Simulation-based Generative Model,15/07/2025,"Hyunwoo Cho, Hyeontae Jo, Hyung Ju Hwang","System inference for nonlinear dynamic models, represented by ordinary
differential equations (ODEs), remains a significant challenge in many fields,
particularly when the data are noisy, sparse, or partially observable. In this
paper, we propose a Simulation-based Generative Model for Imperfect Data

proposed approach integrates two key methods: (1) physics-informed neural
networks with hyper-networks that constructs an ODE solver, and (2) Wasserstein
generative adversarial networks that estimates ODE parameters by effectively
capturing noisy data distributions. We demonstrate that SiGMoID quantifies data
noise, estimates system parameters, and infers unobserved system components.
Its effectiveness is validated validated through realistic experimental

Domain-Adaptive Small Language Models for Structured Tax Code Prediction,15/07/2025,"Souvik Nath, Sumit Wadhwa, Luiz Perez","Every day, multinational firms process thousands of transactions, each of
which must adhere to tax regulations that vary by jurisdiction and are often
nuanced. The determination of product and service tax codes, such as HSN or SAC
is a major use case in Tax compliance. An accurate determination of such codes
is imperative to avoid any tax penalties. This paper proposes a domain-adaptive
small language model (SLM) with an encoder-decoder architecture for the
enhanced prediction of product and service tax codes. In this approach, we
address the problem of predicting hierarchical tax code sequences using
unstructured product and services data. We employ an SLM based upon
encoder-decoder architecture as this enables sequential generation of tax codes
to capture the hierarchical dependencies present within the tax codes. Our
experiments demonstrate that encoder-decoder SLMs can be successfully applied
to the sequential prediction of structured tax codes, a domain that remains
comparatively unexplored in current NLP research. In this paper, we demonstrate
the superior performance of the domain-adaptive encoder-decoder SLMs over flat
classifiers when applied to the Harmonized System of Nomenclature (HSN), and
achieve superior results compared to decoder-only and encoder-only
architectures for structured sequence generation tasks. This approach can also
be scaled to other government-mandated tax commodity codes, such as United
Nations Standard Products and Services Codes (UNSPSC), or Brazil's Nomenclatura
Comum do Mercosul (NCM).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10880v1,,False
