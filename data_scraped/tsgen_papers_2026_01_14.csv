Multiplex Thinking: Reasoning via Token-wise Branch-and-Merge,13/01/2026,"Yao Tang, Li Dong, Yaru Hao, Qingxiu Dong, Furu Wei, Jiatao Gu","Large language models often solve complex reasoning tasks more effectively with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), but at the cost of long, low-bandwidth token sequences. Humans, by contrast, often reason softly by maintaining a distribution over plausible next steps. Motivated by this, we propose Multiplex Thinking, a stochastic soft reasoning mechanism that, at each thinking step, samples K candidate tokens and aggregates their embeddings into a single continuous multiplex token. This preserves the vocabulary embedding prior and the sampling dynamics of standard discrete generation, while inducing a tractable probability distribution over multiplex rollouts. Consequently, multiplex trajectories can be directly optimized with on-policy reinforcement learning (RL). Importantly, Multiplex Thinking is self-adaptive: when the model is confident, the multiplex token is nearly discrete and behaves like standard CoT; when it is uncertain, it compactly represents multiple plausible next steps without increasing sequence length. Across challenging math reasoning benchmarks, Multiplex Thinking consistently outperforms strong discrete CoT and RL baselines from Pass@1 through Pass@1024, while producing shorter sequences.

Prism: Towards Lowering User Cognitive Load in LLMs via Complex Intent Understanding,13/01/2026,"Zenghua Liao, Jinzhi Liao, Xiang Zhao","Large Language Models are rapidly emerging as web-native interfaces to social platforms. On the social web, users frequently have ambiguous and dynamic goals, making complex intent understanding-rather than single-turn execution-the cornerstone of effective human-LLM collaboration. Existing approaches attempt to clarify user intents through sequential or parallel questioning, yet they fall short of addressing the core challenge: modeling the logical dependencies among clarification questions. Inspired by the Cognitive Load Theory, we propose Prism, a novel framework for complex intent understanding that enables logically coherent and efficient intent clarification. Prism comprises four tailored modules: a complex intent decomposition module, which decomposes user intents into smaller, well-structured elements and identifies logical dependencies among them; a logical clarification generation module, which organizes clarification questions based on these dependencies to ensure coherent, low-friction interactions; an intent-aware reward module, which evaluates the quality of clarification trajectories via an intent-aware reward function and leverages Monte Carlo Sample to simulate user-LLM interactions for large-scale,high-quality training data generation; and a self-evolved intent tuning module, which iteratively refines the LLM's logical clarification capability through data-driven feedback and optimization. Prism consistently outperforms existing approaches across clarification interactions, intent execution, and cognitive load benchmarks. It achieves stateof-the-art logical consistency, reduces logical conflicts to 11.5%, increases user satisfaction by 14.4%, and decreases task completion time by 34.8%. All data and code are released.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08653v1,,False
M$^2$FMoE: Multi-Resolution Multi-View Frequency Mixture-of-Experts for Extreme-Adaptive Time Series Forecasting,13/01/2026,"Yaohui Huang, Runmin Zou, Yun Wang, Laeeq Aslam, Ruipeng Dong","Forecasting time series with extreme events is critical yet challenging due to their high variance, irregular dynamics, and sparse but high-impact nature. While existing methods excel in modeling dominant regular patterns, their performance degrades significantly during extreme events, constituting the primary source of forecasting errors in real-world applications. Although some approaches incorporate auxiliary signals to improve performance, they still fail to capture extreme events' complex temporal dynamics. To address these limitations, we propose M$^2$FMoE, an extreme-adaptive forecasting model that learns both regular and extreme patterns through multi-resolution and multi-view frequency modeling. It comprises three modules: (1) a multi-view frequency mixture-of-experts module assigns experts to distinct spectral bands in Fourier and Wavelet domains, with cross-view shared band splitter aligning frequency partitions and enabling inter-expert collaboration to capture both dominant and rare fluctuations; (2) a multi-resolution adaptive fusion module that hierarchically aggregates frequency features from coarse to fine resolutions, enhancing sensitivity to both short-term variations and sudden changes; (3) a temporal gating integration module that dynamically balances long-term trends and short-term frequency-aware features, improving adaptability to both regular and extreme temporal patterns. Experiments on real-world hydrological datasets with extreme patterns demonstrate that M$^2$FMoE outperforms state-of-the-art baselines without requiring extreme-event labels.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08631v1,,False
Sampling via Stochastic Interpolants by Langevin-based Velocity and Initialization Estimation in Flow ODEs,13/01/2026,"Chenguang Duan, Yuling Jiao, Gabriele Steidl, Christian Wald, Jerry Zhijian Yang, Ruizhe Zhang","We propose a novel method for sampling from unnormalized Boltzmann densities based on a probability-flow ordinary differential equation (ODE) derived from linear stochastic interpolants. The key innovation of our approach is the use of a sequence of Langevin samplers to enable efficient simulation of the flow. Specifically, these Langevin samplers are employed (i) to generate samples from the interpolant distribution at intermediate times and (ii) to construct, starting from these intermediate times, a robust estimator of the velocity field governing the flow ODE. For both applications of the Langevin diffusions, we establish convergence guarantees. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method on challenging multimodal distributions across a range of dimensions, as well as its effectiveness in Bayesian inference tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08527v1,,False
Out-of-distribution generalization of deep-learning surrogates for 2D PDE-generated dynamics in the small-data regime,13/01/2026,"Binh Duong Nguyen, Stefan Sandfeld","Partial differential equations (PDEs) are a central tool for modeling the dynamics of physical, engineering, and materials systems, but high-fidelity simulations are often computationally expensive. At the same time, many scientific applications can be viewed as the evolution of spatially distributed fields, making data-driven forecasting of such fields a core task in scientific machine learning. In this work we study autoregressive deep-learning surrogates for two-dimensional PDE dynamics on periodic domains, focusing on generalization to out-of-distribution initial conditions within a fixed PDE and parameter regime and on strict small-data settings with at most $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ simulated trajectories per system. We introduce a multi-channel U-Net [...], evaluate it on five qualitatively different PDE families and compare it to ViT, AFNO, PDE-Transformer, and KAN-UNet under a common training setup. Across all datasets, me-UNet matches or outperforms these more complex architectures in terms of field-space error, spectral similarity, and physics-based metrics for in-distribution rollouts, while requiring substantially less training time. It also generalizes qualitatively to unseen initial conditions with as few as $\approx 20$ training simulations. A data-efficiency study and Grad-CAM analysis further suggest that, in small-data periodic 2D PDE settings, convolutional architectures with inductive biases aligned to locality and periodic boundary conditions remain strong contenders for accurate and moderately out-of-distribution-robust surrogate modeling.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08404v1,,False
Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO): A Principled RL Algorithm for Generative Search LLMs,13/01/2026,"Abhijnan Nath, Alireza Bagheri Garakani, Tianchen Zhou, Fan Yang, Nikhil Krishnaswamy","Large language models are increasingly trained via reinforcement learning for personalized recommendation tasks, but standard methods like GRPO rely on sparse, sequence-level rewards that create a credit assignment gap, obscuring which tokens drive success. This gap is especially problematic when models must infer latent user intent from under-specified language without ground truth labels, a reasoning pattern rarely seen during pretraining. We introduce Owen-Shapley Policy Optimization (OSPO), a framework that redistributes sequence-level advantages based on tokens' marginal contributions to outcomes. Unlike value-model-based methods requiring additional computation, OSPO employs potential-based reward shaping via Shapley-Owen attributions to assign segment-level credit while preserving the optimal policy, learning directly from task feedback without parametric value models. By forming coalitions of semantically coherent units (phrases describing product attributes or sentences capturing preferences), OSPO identifies which response parts drive performance. Experiments on Amazon ESCI and H&M Fashion datasets show consistent gains over baselines, with notable test-time robustness to out-of-distribution retrievers unseen during training.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08403v1,,False
Disentangling History and Propagation Dependencies in Cross-Subject Knee Contact Stress Prediction Using a Shared MeshGraphNet Backbone,13/01/2026,"Zhengye Pan, Jianwei Zuo, Jiajia Luo","Background:Subject-specific finite element analysis accurately characterizes knee joint mechanics but is computationally expensive. Deep surrogate models provide a rapid alternative, yet their generalization across subjects under limited pose and load inputs remains unclear. It remains unclear whether the dominant source of prediction uncertainty arises from temporal history dependence or spatial propagation dependence. Methods:To disentangle these factors, we employed a shared MGN backbone with a fixed mesh topology. A dataset of running trials from nine subjects was constructed using an OpenSim-FEBio workflow. We developed four model variants to isolate specific dependencies: (1) a baseline MGN; (2) CT-MGN, incorporating a Control Transformer to encode short-horizon history; (3) MsgModMGN, applying state-conditioned modulation to message passing for adaptive propagation; (4) CT-MsgModMGN, combining both mechanisms. Models were evaluated using a rigorous grouped 3-fold cross-validation on unseen subjects.Results:The models incorporating history encoding significantly outperformed the baseline MGN and MsgModMGN in global accuracy and spatial consistency. Crucially, the CT module effectively mitigated the peak-shaving defect common in deep surrogates, significantly reducing peak stress prediction errors. In contrast, the spatial propagation modulation alone yielded no significant improvement over the baseline, and combining it with CT provided no additional benefit.Conclusion:Temporal history dependence, rather than spatial propagation modulation, is the primary driver of prediction uncertainty in cross-subject knee contact mechanics. Explicitly encoding short-horizon driver sequences enables the surrogate model to recover implicit phase information, thereby achieving superior fidelity in peak-stress capture and high-risk localization compared to purely state-based approaches.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08318v1,,False
Wasserstein-p Central Limit Theorem Rates: From Local Dependence to Markov Chains,13/01/2026,"Yixuan Zhang, Qiaomin Xie","Finite-time central limit theorem (CLT) rates play a central role in modern machine learning (ML). In this paper, we study CLT rates for multivariate dependent data in Wasserstein-$p$ ($\mathcal W_p$) distance, for general $p\ge 1$. We focus on two fundamental dependence structures that commonly arise in ML: locally dependent sequences and geometrically ergodic Markov chains. In both settings, we establish the \textit{first optimal} $\mathcal O(n^{-1/2})$ rate in $\mathcal W_1$, as well as the first $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) CLT rates under mild moment assumptions, substantially improving the best previously known bounds in these dependent-data regimes. As an application of our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rate for locally dependent sequences, we further obtain the first optimal $\mathcal W_1$--CLT rate for multivariate $U$-statistics.
  On the technical side, we derive a tractable auxiliary bound for $\mathcal W_1$ Gaussian approximation errors that is well suited to studying dependent data. For Markov chains, we further prove that the regeneration time of the split chain associated with a geometrically ergodic chain has a geometric tail without assuming strong aperiodicity or other restrictive conditions. These tools may be of independent interests and enable our optimal $\mathcal W_1$ rates and underpin our $\mathcal W_p$ ($p\ge 2$) results.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08184v1,,False
Instruction-Driven 3D Facial Expression Generation and Transition,13/01/2026,"Anh H. Vo, Tae-Seok Kim, Hulin Jin, Soo-Mi Choi, Yong-Guk Kim","A 3D avatar typically has one of six cardinal facial expressions. To simulate realistic emotional variation, we should be able to render a facial transition between two arbitrary expressions. This study presents a new framework for instruction-driven facial expression generation that produces a 3D face and, starting from an image of the face, transforms the facial expression from one designated facial expression to another. The Instruction-driven Facial Expression Decomposer (IFED) module is introduced to facilitate multimodal data learning and capture the correlation between textual descriptions and facial expression features. Subsequently, we propose the Instruction to Facial Expression Transition (I2FET) method, which leverages IFED and a vertex reconstruction loss function to refine the semantic comprehension of latent vectors, thus generating a facial expression sequence according to the given instruction. Lastly, we present the Facial Expression Transition model to generate smooth transitions between facial expressions. Extensive evaluation suggests that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the CK+ and CelebV-HQ datasets. The results show that our framework can generate facial expression trajectories according to text instruction. Considering that text prompts allow us to make diverse descriptions of human emotional states, the repertoire of facial expressions and the transitions between them can be expanded greatly. We expect our framework to find various practical applications More information about our project can be found at https://vohoanganh.github.io/tg3dfet/",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08179v1,10.1109/TMM.2025.3565929,False
"The Agent's First Day: Benchmarking Learning, Exploration, and Scheduling in the Workplace Scenarios",13/01/2026,"Daocheng Fu, Jianbiao Mei, Rong Wu, Xuemeng Yang, Jia Xu, Ding Wang, Pinlong Cai, Yong Liu, Licheng Wen, Botian Shi","The rapid evolution of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has advanced workflow automation; however, existing research mainly targets performance upper bounds in static environments, overlooking robustness for stochastic real-world deployment. We identify three key challenges: dynamic task scheduling, active exploration under uncertainty, and continuous learning from experience. To bridge this gap, we introduce \method{}, a dynamic evaluation environment that simulates a ""trainee"" agent continuously exploring a novel setting. Unlike traditional benchmarks, \method{} evaluates agents along three dimensions: (1) context-aware scheduling for streaming tasks with varying priorities; (2) prudent information acquisition to reduce hallucination via active exploration; and (3) continuous evolution by distilling generalized strategies from rule-based, dynamically generated tasks. Experiments show that cutting-edge agents have significant deficiencies in dynamic environments, especially in active exploration and continual learning. Our work establishes a framework for assessing agent reliability, shifting evaluation from static tests to realistic, production-oriented scenarios.

Generalization Analysis and Method for Domain Generalization for a Family of Recurrent Neural Networks,13/01/2026,"Atefeh Termehchi, Ekram Hossain, Isaac Woungang","Deep learning (DL) has driven broad advances across scientific and engineering domains. Despite its success, DL models often exhibit limited interpretability and generalization, which can undermine trust, especially in safety-critical deployments. As a result, there is growing interest in (i) analyzing interpretability and generalization and (ii) developing models that perform robustly under data distributions different from those seen during training (i.e. domain generalization). However, the theoretical analysis of DL remains incomplete. For example, many generalization analyses assume independent samples, which is violated in sequential data with temporal correlations. Motivated by these limitations, this paper proposes a method to analyze interpretability and out-of-domain (OOD) generalization for a family of recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Specifically, the evolution of a trained RNN's states is modeled as an unknown, discrete-time, nonlinear closed-loop feedback system. Using Koopman operator theory, these nonlinear dynamics are approximated with a linear operator, enabling interpretability. Spectral analysis is then used to quantify the worst-case impact of domain shifts on the generalization error. Building on this analysis, a domain generalization method is proposed that reduces the OOD generalization error and improves the robustness to distribution shifts. Finally, the proposed analysis and domain generalization approach are validated on practical temporal pattern-learning tasks.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08122v1,,False
MirrorBench: An Extensible Framework to Evaluate User-Proxy Agents for Human-Likeness,13/01/2026,"Ashutosh Hathidara, Julien Yu, Vaishali Senthil, Sebastian Schreiber, Anil Babu Ankisettipalli","Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used as human simulators, both for evaluating conversational systems and for generating fine-tuning data. However, naive ""act-as-a-user"" prompting often yields verbose, unrealistic utterances, underscoring the need for principled evaluation of so-called user proxy agents. We present MIRRORBENCH, a reproducible, extensible benchmarking framework that evaluates user proxies solely on their ability to produce human-like user utterances across diverse conversational tasks, explicitly decoupled from downstream task success. MIRRORBENCH features a modular execution engine with typed interfaces, metadata-driven registries, multi-backend support, caching, and robust observability. The system supports pluggable user proxies, datasets, tasks, and metrics, enabling researchers to evaluate arbitrary simulators under a uniform, variance-aware harness. We include three lexical-diversity metrics (MATTR, YULE'S K, and HD-D) and three LLM-judge-based metrics (GTEval, Pairwise Indistinguishability, and Rubric-and-Reason). Across four open datasets, MIRRORBENCH yields variance-aware results and reveals systematic gaps between user proxies and real human users. The framework is open source and includes a simple command-line interface for running experiments, managing configurations and caching, and generating reports.

Learning a Stochastic Differential Equation Model of Tropical Cyclone Intensification from Reanalysis and Observational Data,13/01/2026,"Kenneth Gee, Sai Ravela","Tropical cyclones are dangerous natural hazards, but their hazard is challenging to quantify directly from historical datasets due to limited dataset size and quality. Models of cyclone intensification fill this data gap by simulating huge ensembles of synthetic hurricanes based on estimates of the storm's large scale environment. Both physics-based and statistical/ML intensification models have been developed to tackle this problem, but an open question is: can a physically reasonable and simple physics-style differential equation model of intensification be learned from data? In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative by presenting a 10-term cubic stochastic differential equation model of Tropical Cyclone intensification. The model depends on a well-vetted suite of engineered environmental features known to drive intensification and is trained using a high quality dataset of hurricane intensity (IBTrACS) with estimates of the cyclone's large scale environment from a data-assimilated simulation (ERA5 reanalysis), restricted to the Northern Hemisphere. The model generates synthetic intensity series which capture many aspects of historical intensification statistics and hazard estimates in the Northern Hemisphere. Our results show promise that interpretable, physics style models of complex earth system dynamics can be learned using automated system identification techniques.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08116v1,,False
STO-RL: Offline RL under Sparse Rewards via LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order,13/01/2026,"Chengyang Gu, Yuxin Pan, Hui Xiong, Yize Chen","Offline reinforcement learning (RL) enables policy learning from pre-collected datasets, avoiding costly and risky online interactions, but it often struggles with long-horizon tasks involving sparse rewards. Existing goal-conditioned and hierarchical offline RL methods decompose such tasks and generate intermediate rewards to mitigate limitations of traditional offline RL, but usually overlook temporal dependencies among subgoals and rely on imprecise reward shaping, leading to suboptimal policies. To address these issues, we propose STO-RL (Offline RL using LLM-Guided Subgoal Temporal Order), an offline RL framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to generate temporally ordered subgoal sequences and corresponding state-to-subgoal-stage mappings. Using this temporal structure, STO-RL applies potential-based reward shaping to transform sparse terminal rewards into dense, temporally consistent signals, promoting subgoal progress while avoiding suboptimal solutions. The resulting augmented dataset with shaped rewards enables efficient offline training of high-performing policies. Evaluations on four discrete and continuous sparse-reward benchmarks demonstrate that STO-RL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art offline goal-conditioned and hierarchical RL baselines, achieving faster convergence, higher success rates, and shorter trajectories. Ablation studies further confirm STO-RL's robustness to imperfect or noisy LLM-generated subgoal sequences, demonstrating that LLM-guided subgoal temporal structures combined with theoretically grounded reward shaping provide a practical and scalable solution for long-horizon offline RL.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08107v1,,False
AdaJudge: Adaptive Multi-Perspective Judging for Reward Modeling,13/01/2026,"Yongliang Miao, Yangyang Liang, Mengnan Du","Reward modeling is essential for aligning large language models with human preferences, yet predominant architectures rely on a static pooling strategy to condense sequences into scalar scores. This paradigm, however, suffers from two key limitations: a static inductive bias that misaligns with task-dependent preference signals, and a representational mismatch, as the backbone is optimized for generation rather than fine-grained discrimination. To address this, we propose AdaJudge, a unified framework that jointly adapts representation and aggregation. AdaJudge first refines backbone representations into a discrimination-oriented space via gated refinement blocks. It then replaces the static readout with an adaptive multi-view pooling module that dynamically routes and combines evidence. Extensive experiments on RM-Bench and JudgeBench show that AdaJudge outperforms strong off-the-shelf reward models and traditional pooling baselines.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08097v1,,False
