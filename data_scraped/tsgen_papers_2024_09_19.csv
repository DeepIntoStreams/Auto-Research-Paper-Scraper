Massively Multi-Person 3D Human Motion Forecasting with Scene Context,18/09/2024,"Felix B Mueller, Julian Tanke, Juergen Gall","Forecasting long-term 3D human motion is challenging: the stochasticity of
human behavior makes it hard to generate realistic human motion from the input
sequence alone. Information on the scene environment and the motion of nearby
people can greatly aid the generation process. We propose a scene-aware social
transformer model (SAST) to forecast long-term (10s) human motion motion.
Unlike previous models, our approach can model interactions between both widely
varying numbers of people and objects in a scene. We combine a temporal
convolutional encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer-based bottleneck
that allows us to efficiently combine motion and scene information. We model
the conditional motion distribution using denoising diffusion models. We
benchmark our approach on the Humans in Kitchens dataset, which contains 1 to
16 persons and 29 to 50 objects that are visible simultaneously. Our model
outperforms other approaches in terms of realism and diversity on different
metrics and in a user study. Code is available at

Computational Dynamical Systems,18/09/2024,"Jordan Cotler, Semon Rezchikov","We study the computational complexity theory of smooth, finite-dimensional
dynamical systems. Building off of previous work, we give definitions for what
it means for a smooth dynamical system to simulate a Turing machine. We then
show that 'chaotic' dynamical systems (more precisely, Axiom A systems) and
'integrable' dynamical systems (more generally, measure-preserving systems)
cannot robustly simulate universal Turing machines, although such machines can
be robustly simulated by other kinds of dynamical systems. Subsequently, we
show that any Turing machine that can be encoded into a structurally stable
one-dimensional dynamical system must have a decidable halting problem, and
moreover an explicit time complexity bound in instances where it does halt.
More broadly, our work elucidates what it means for one 'machine' to simulate
another, and emphasizes the necessity of defining low-complexity 'encoders' and
'decoders' to translate between the dynamics of the simulation and the system
being simulated. We highlight how the notion of a computational dynamical
system leads to questions at the intersection of computational complexity
theory, dynamical systems theory, and real algebraic geometry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12179v1,,False
A Unified Framework for Neural Computation and Learning Over Time,18/09/2024,"Stefano Melacci, Alessandro Betti, Michele Casoni, Tommaso Guidi, Matteo Tiezzi, Marco Gori","This paper proposes Hamiltonian Learning, a novel unified framework for
learning with neural networks ""over time"", i.e., from a possibly infinite
stream of data, in an online manner, without having access to future
information. Existing works focus on the simplified setting in which the stream
has a known finite length or is segmented into smaller sequences, leveraging
well-established learning strategies from statistical machine learning. In this
paper, the problem of learning over time is rethought from scratch, leveraging
tools from optimal control theory, which yield a unifying view of the temporal
dynamics of neural computations and learning. Hamiltonian Learning is based on
differential equations that: (i) can be integrated without the need of external
software solvers; (ii) generalize the well-established notion of gradient-based
learning in feed-forward and recurrent networks; (iii) open to novel
perspectives. The proposed framework is showcased by experimentally proving how
it can recover gradient-based learning, comparing it to out-of-the box
optimizers, and describing how it is flexible enough to switch from fully-local
to partially/non-local computational schemes, possibly distributed over
multiple devices, and BackPropagation without storing activations. Hamiltonian
Learning is easy to implement and can help researches approach in a principled
and innovative manner the problem of learning over time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12038v1,,False
Topological Deep Learning with State-Space Models: A Mamba Approach for Simplicial Complexes,18/09/2024,"Marco Montagna, Simone Scardapane, Lev Telyatnikov","Graph Neural Networks based on the message-passing (MP) mechanism are a
dominant approach for handling graph-structured data. However, they are
inherently limited to modeling only pairwise interactions, making it difficult
to explicitly capture the complexity of systems with $n$-body relations. To
address this, topological deep learning has emerged as a promising field for
studying and modeling higher-order interactions using various topological
domains, such as simplicial and cellular complexes. While these new domains
provide powerful representations, they introduce new challenges, such as
effectively modeling the interactions among higher-order structures through
higher-order MP. Meanwhile, structured state-space sequence models have proven
to be effective for sequence modeling and have recently been adapted for graph
data by encoding the neighborhood of a node as a sequence, thereby avoiding the
MP mechanism. In this work, we propose a novel architecture designed to operate
with simplicial complexes, utilizing the Mamba state-space model as its
backbone. Our approach generates sequences for the nodes based on the
neighboring cells, enabling direct communication between all higher-order
structures, regardless of their rank. We extensively validate our model,
demonstrating that it achieves competitive performance compared to
state-of-the-art models developed for simplicial complexes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12033v1,,False
Promise and Peril of Collaborative Code Generation Models: Balancing Effectiveness and Memorization,18/09/2024,"Zhi Chen, Lingxiao Jiang","In the rapidly evolving field of machine learning, training models with
datasets from various locations and organizations presents significant
challenges due to privacy and legal concerns. The exploration of effective
collaborative training settings capable of leveraging valuable knowledge from
distributed and isolated datasets is increasingly crucial. This study
investigates key factors that impact the effectiveness of collaborative
training methods in code next-token prediction, as well as the correctness and
utility of the generated code, demonstrating the promise of such methods.
Additionally, we evaluate the memorization of different participant training
data across various collaborative training settings, including centralized,
federated, and incremental training, highlighting their potential risks in
leaking data. Our findings indicate that the size and diversity of code
datasets are pivotal factors influencing the success of collaboratively trained
code models. We show that federated learning achieves competitive performance
compared to centralized training while offering better data protection, as
evidenced by lower memorization ratios in the generated code. However,
federated learning can still produce verbatim code snippets from hidden
training data, potentially violating privacy or copyright. Our study further
explores effectiveness and memorization patterns in incremental learning,
emphasizing the sequence in which individual participant datasets are
introduced. We also identify cross-organizational clones as a prevalent
challenge in both centralized and federated learning scenarios. Our findings
highlight the persistent risk of data leakage during inference, even when
training data remains unseen. We conclude with recommendations for
practitioners and researchers to optimize multisource datasets, propelling
cross-organizational collaboration forward.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12020v1,,False
Additive-feature-attribution methods: a review on explainable artificial intelligence for fluid dynamics and heat transfer,18/09/2024,"Andr√©s Cremades, Sergio Hoyas, Ricardo Vinuesa","The use of data-driven methods in fluid mechanics has surged dramatically in
recent years due to their capacity to adapt to the complex and multi-scale
nature of turbulent flows, as well as to detect patterns in large-scale
simulations or experimental tests. In order to interpret the relationships
generated in the models during the training process, numerical attributions
need to be assigned to the input features. One important example are the
additive-feature-attribution methods. These explainability methods link the
input features with the model prediction, providing an interpretation based on
a linear formulation of the models. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP
values) are formulated as the only possible interpretation that offers a unique
solution for understanding the model. In this manuscript, the
additive-feature-attribution methods are presented, showing four common
implementations in the literature: kernel SHAP, tree SHAP, gradient SHAP, and
deep SHAP. Then, the main applications of the additive-feature-attribution
methods are introduced, dividing them into three main groups: turbulence
modeling, fluid-mechanics fundamentals, and applied problems in fluid dynamics
and heat transfer. This review shows thatexplainability techniques, and in
particular additive-feature-attribution methods, are crucial for implementing
interpretable and physics-compliant deep-learning models in the fluid-mechanics
field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11992v1,,False
Metric-Semantic Factor Graph Generation based on Graph Neural Networks,18/09/2024,"Jose Andres Millan-Romera, Hriday Bavle, Muhammad Shaheer, Holger Voos, Jose Luis Sanchez-Lopez","Understanding the relationships between geometric structures and semantic
concepts is crucial for building accurate models of complex environments. In
indoors, certain spatial constraints, such as the relative positioning of
planes, remain consistent despite variations in layout. This paper explores how
these invariant relationships can be captured in a graph SLAM framework by
representing high-level concepts like rooms and walls, linking them to
geometric elements like planes through an optimizable factor graph. Several
efforts have tackled this issue with add-hoc solutions for each concept
generation and with manually-defined factors.
  This paper proposes a novel method for metric-semantic factor graph
generation which includes defining a semantic scene graph, integrating
geometric information, and learning the interconnecting factors, all based on
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). An edge classification network (G-GNN) sorts the
edges between planes into same room, same wall or none types. The resulting
relations are clustered, generating a room or wall for each cluster. A second
family of networks (F-GNN) infers the geometrical origin of the new nodes. The
definition of the factors employs the same F-GNN used for the metric attribute
of the generated nodes. Furthermore, share the new factor graph with the
S-Graphs+ algorithm, extending its graph expressiveness and scene
representation with the ultimate goal of improving the SLAM performance. The
complexity of the environments is increased to N-plane rooms by training the
networks on L-shaped rooms. The framework is evaluated in synthetic and
simulated scenarios as no real datasets of the required complex layouts are
available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11972v1,,False
"RaggeDi: Diffusion-based State Estimation of Disordered Rags, Sheets, Towels and Blankets",18/09/2024,"Jikai Ye, Wanze Li, Shiraz Khan, Gregory S. Chirikjian","Cloth state estimation is an important problem in robotics. It is essential
for the robot to know the accurate state to manipulate cloth and execute tasks
such as robotic dressing, stitching, and covering/uncovering human beings.
However, estimating cloth state accurately remains challenging due to its high
flexibility and self-occlusion. This paper proposes a diffusion model-based
pipeline that formulates the cloth state estimation as an image generation
problem by representing the cloth state as an RGB image that describes the
point-wise translation (translation map) between a pre-defined flattened mesh
and the deformed mesh in a canonical space. Then we train a conditional
diffusion-based image generation model to predict the translation map based on
an observation. Experiments are conducted in both simulation and the real world
to validate the performance of our method. Results indicate that our method
outperforms two recent methods in both accuracy and speed.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11831v1,,False
Smart Data-Driven GRU Predictor for SnO$_2$ Thin films Characteristics,18/09/2024,"Faiza Bouamra, Mohamed Sayah, Labib Sadek Terrissa, Noureddine Zerhouni","In material physics, characterization techniques are foremost crucial for
obtaining the materials data regarding the physical properties as well as
structural, electronics, magnetic, optic, dielectric, and spectroscopic
characteristics. However, for many materials, ensuring availability and safe
accessibility is not always easy and fully warranted. Moreover, the use of
modeling and simulation techniques need a lot of theoretical knowledge, in
addition of being associated to costly computation time and a great complexity
deal. Thus, analyzing materials with different techniques for multiple samples
simultaneously, still be very challenging for engineers and researchers. It is
worth noting that although of being very risky, X-ray diffraction is the well
known and widely used characterization technique which gathers data from
structural properties of crystalline 1d, 2d or 3d materials. We propose in this
paper, a Smart GRU for Gated Recurrent Unit model to forcast structural
characteristics or properties of thin films of tin oxide SnO$_2$(110). Indeed,
thin films samples are elaborated and managed experimentally and the collected
data dictionary is then used to generate an AI -- Artificial Intelligence --

Knowledge Adaptation Network for Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning,18/09/2024,"Ye Wang, Yaxiong Wang, Guoshuai Zhao, Xueming Qian","Few-shot class-incremental learning (FSCIL) aims to incrementally recognize
new classes using a few samples while maintaining the performance on previously
learned classes. One of the effective methods to solve this challenge is to
construct prototypical evolution classifiers. Despite the advancement achieved
by most existing methods, the classifier weights are simply initialized using
mean features. Because representations for new classes are weak and biased, we
argue such a strategy is suboptimal. In this paper, we tackle this issue from
two aspects. Firstly, thanks to the development of foundation models, we employ
a foundation model, the CLIP, as the network pedestal to provide a general
representation for each class. Secondly, to generate a more reliable and
comprehensive instance representation, we propose a Knowledge Adapter (KA)
module that summarizes the data-specific knowledge from training data and fuses
it into the general representation. Additionally, to tune the knowledge learned
from the base classes to the upcoming classes, we propose a mechanism of
Incremental Pseudo Episode Learning (IPEL) by simulating the actual FSCIL.
Taken together, our proposed method, dubbed as Knowledge Adaptation Network
(KANet), achieves competitive performance on a wide range of datasets,
including CIFAR100, CUB200, and ImageNet-R.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11770v1,,False
Recurrent Interpolants for Probabilistic Time Series Prediction,18/09/2024,"Yu Chen, Marin Bilo≈°, Sarthak Mittal, Wei Deng, Kashif Rasul, Anderson Schneider","Sequential models such as recurrent neural networks or transformer-based
models became \textit{de facto} tools for multivariate time series forecasting
in a probabilistic fashion, with applications to a wide range of datasets, such
as finance, biology, medicine, etc. Despite their adeptness in capturing
dependencies, assessing prediction uncertainty, and efficiency in training,
challenges emerge in modeling high-dimensional complex distributions and
cross-feature dependencies. To tackle these issues, recent works delve into
generative modeling by employing diffusion or flow-based models. Notably, the
integration of stochastic differential equations or probability flow
successfully extends these methods to probabilistic time series imputation and
forecasting. However, scalability issues necessitate a computational-friendly
framework for large-scale generative model-based predictions. This work
proposes a novel approach by blending the computational efficiency of recurrent
neural networks with the high-quality probabilistic modeling of the diffusion
model, which addresses challenges and advances generative models' application
in time series forecasting. Our method relies on the foundation of stochastic
interpolants and the extension to a broader conditional generation framework
with additional control features, offering insights for future developments in
this dynamic field.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11684v1,,False
Towards Explainable Goal Recognition Using Weight of Evidence (WoE): A Human-Centered Approach,18/09/2024,"Abeer Alshehri, Amal Abdulrahman, Hajar Alamri, Tim Miller, Mor Vered","Goal recognition (GR) involves inferring an agent's unobserved goal from a
sequence of observations. This is a critical problem in AI with diverse
applications. Traditionally, GR has been addressed using 'inference to the best
explanation' or abduction, where hypotheses about the agent's goals are
generated as the most plausible explanations for observed behavior.
Alternatively, some approaches enhance interpretability by ensuring that an
agent's behavior aligns with an observer's expectations or by making the
reasoning behind decisions more transparent. In this work, we tackle a
different challenge: explaining the GR process in a way that is comprehensible
to humans. We introduce and evaluate an explainable model for goal recognition
(GR) agents, grounded in the theoretical framework and cognitive processes
underlying human behavior explanation. Drawing on insights from two human-agent
studies, we propose a conceptual framework for human-centered explanations of
GR. Using this framework, we develop the eXplainable Goal Recognition (XGR)
model, which generates explanations for both why and why not questions. We
evaluate the model computationally across eight GR benchmarks and through three
user studies. The first study assesses the efficiency of generating human-like
explanations within the Sokoban game domain, the second examines perceived
explainability in the same domain, and the third evaluates the model's
effectiveness in aiding decision-making in illegal fishing detection. Results
demonstrate that the XGR model significantly enhances user understanding,
trust, and decision-making compared to baseline models, underscoring its
potential to improve human-agent collaboration.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11675v1,,False
Few-Shot Class-Incremental Learning with Non-IID Decentralized Data,18/09/2024,"Cuiwei Liu, Siang Xu, Huaijun Qiu, Jing Zhang, Zhi Liu, Liang Zhao","Few-shot class-incremental learning is crucial for developing scalable and
adaptive intelligent systems, as it enables models to acquire new classes with
minimal annotated data while safeguarding the previously accumulated knowledge.
Nonetheless, existing methods deal with continuous data streams in a
centralized manner, limiting their applicability in scenarios that prioritize
data privacy and security. To this end, this paper introduces federated
few-shot class-incremental learning, a decentralized machine learning paradigm
tailored to progressively learn new classes from scarce data distributed across
multiple clients. In this learning paradigm, clients locally update their
models with new classes while preserving data privacy, and then transmit the
model updates to a central server where they are aggregated globally. However,
this paradigm faces several issues, such as difficulties in few-shot learning,
catastrophic forgetting, and data heterogeneity. To address these challenges,
we present a synthetic data-driven framework that leverages replay buffer data
to maintain existing knowledge and facilitate the acquisition of new knowledge.
Within this framework, a noise-aware generative replay module is developed to
fine-tune local models with a balance of new and replay data, while generating
synthetic data of new classes to further expand the replay buffer for future
tasks. Furthermore, a class-specific weighted aggregation strategy is designed
to tackle data heterogeneity by adaptively aggregating class-specific
parameters based on local models performance on synthetic data. This enables
effective global model optimization without direct access to client data.
Comprehensive experiments across three widely-used datasets underscore the
effectiveness and preeminence of the introduced framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.11657v1,,False
