LeLaR: The First In-Orbit Demonstration of an AI-Based Satellite Attitude Controller,22/12/2025,"Kirill Djebko, Tom Baumann, Erik Dilger, Frank Puppe, Sergio Montenegro","Attitude control is essential for many satellite missions. Classical controllers, however, are time-consuming to design and sensitive to model uncertainties and variations in operational boundary conditions. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) offers a promising alternative by learning adaptive control strategies through autonomous interaction with a simulation environment. Overcoming the Sim2Real gap, which involves deploying an agent trained in simulation onto the real physical satellite, remains a significant challenge. In this work, we present the first successful in-orbit demonstration of an AI-based attitude controller for inertial pointing maneuvers. The controller was trained entirely in simulation and deployed to the InnoCube 3U nanosatellite, which was developed by the Julius-Maximilians-Universität Würzburg in cooperation with the Technische Universität Berlin, and launched in January 2025. We present the AI agent design, the methodology of the training procedure, the discrepancies between the simulation and the observed behavior of the real satellite, and a comparison of the AI-based attitude controller with the classical PD controller of InnoCube. Steady-state metrics confirm the robust performance of the AI-based controller during repeated in-orbit maneuvers.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19576v1,,False
REALM: A Real-to-Sim Validated Benchmark for Generalization in Robotic Manipulation,22/12/2025,"Martin Sedlacek, Pavlo Yefanov, Georgy Ponimatkin, Jai Bardhan, Simon Pilc, Mederic Fourmy, Evangelos Kazakos, Cees G. M. Snoek, Josef Sivic, Vladimir Petrik","Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models empower robots to understand and execute tasks described by natural language instructions. However, a key challenge lies in their ability to generalize beyond the specific environments and conditions they were trained on, which is presently difficult and expensive to evaluate in the real-world. To address this gap, we present REALM, a new simulation environment and benchmark designed to evaluate the generalization capabilities of VLA models, with a specific emphasis on establishing a strong correlation between simulated and real-world performance through high-fidelity visuals and aligned robot control. Our environment offers a suite of 15 perturbation factors, 7 manipulation skills, and more than 3,500 objects. Finally, we establish two task sets that form our benchmark and evaluate the π_{0}, π_{0}-FAST, and GR00T N1.5 VLA models, showing that generalization and robustness remain an open challenge. More broadly, we also show that simulation gives us a valuable proxy for the real-world and allows us to systematically probe for and quantify the weaknesses and failure modes of VLAs.

Deep Learning for Unrelated-Machines Scheduling: Handling Variable Dimensions,22/12/2025,"Diego Hitzges, Guillaume Sagnol","Deep learning has been effectively applied to many discrete optimization problems. However, learning-based scheduling on unrelated parallel machines remains particularly difficult to design. Not only do the numbers of jobs and machines vary, but each job-machine pair has a unique processing time, dynamically altering feature dimensions. We propose a novel approach with a neural network tailored for offline deterministic scheduling of arbitrary sizes on unrelated machines. The goal is to minimize a complex objective function that includes the makespan and the weighted tardiness of jobs and machines. Unlike existing online approaches, which process jobs sequentially, our method generates a complete schedule considering the entire input at once. The key contribution of this work lies in the sophisticated architecture of our model. By leveraging various NLP-inspired architectures, it effectively processes any number of jobs and machines with varying feature dimensions imposed by unrelated processing times. Our approach enables supervised training on small problem instances while demonstrating strong generalization to much larger scheduling environments. Trained and tested on instances with 8 jobs and 4 machines, costs were only 2.51% above optimal. Across all tested configurations of up to 100 jobs and 10 machines, our network consistently outperformed an advanced dispatching rule, which incurred 22.22% higher costs on average. As our method allows fast retraining with simulated data and adaptation to various scheduling conditions, we believe it has the potential to become a standard approach for learning-based scheduling on unrelated machines and similar problem environments.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19527v1,,False
Real-Time Streamable Generative Speech Restoration with Flow Matching,22/12/2025,"Simon Welker, Bunlong Lay, Maris Hillemann, Tal Peer, Timo Gerkmann","Diffusion-based generative models have greatly impacted the speech processing field in recent years, exhibiting high speech naturalness and spawning a new research direction. Their application in real-time communication is, however, still lagging behind due to their computation-heavy nature involving multiple calls of large DNNs.
  Here, we present Stream.FM, a frame-causal flow-based generative model with an algorithmic latency of 32 milliseconds (ms) and a total latency of 48 ms, paving the way for generative speech processing in real-time communication. We propose a buffered streaming inference scheme and an optimized DNN architecture, show how learned few-step numerical solvers can boost output quality at a fixed compute budget, explore model weight compression to find favorable points along a compute/quality tradeoff, and contribute a model variant with 24 ms total latency for the speech enhancement task.
  Our work looks beyond theoretical latencies, showing that high-quality streaming generative speech processing can be realized on consumer GPUs available today. Stream.FM can solve a variety of speech processing tasks in a streaming fashion: speech enhancement, dereverberation, codec post-filtering, bandwidth extension, STFT phase retrieval, and Mel vocoding. As we verify through comprehensive evaluations and a MUSHRA listening test, Stream.FM establishes a state-of-the-art for generative streaming speech restoration, exhibits only a reasonable reduction in quality compared to a non-streaming variant, and outperforms our recent work (Diffusion Buffer) on generative streaming speech enhancement while operating at a lower latency.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19442v1,,False
MT-Mark: Rethinking Image Watermarking via Mutual-Teacher Collaboration with Adaptive Feature Modulation,22/12/2025,"Fei Ge, Ying Huang, Jie Liu, Guixuan Zhang, Zhi Zeng, Shuwu Zhang, Hu Guan","Existing deep image watermarking methods follow a fixed embedding-distortion-extraction pipeline, where the embedder and extractor are weakly coupled through a final loss and optimized in isolation. This design lacks explicit collaboration, leaving no structured mechanism for the embedder to incorporate decoding-aware cues or for the extractor to guide embedding during training. To address this architectural limitation, we rethink deep image watermarking by reformulating embedding and extraction as explicitly collaborative components. To realize this reformulation, we introduce a Collaborative Interaction Mechanism (CIM) that establishes direct, bidirectional communication between the embedder and extractor, enabling a mutual-teacher training paradigm and coordinated optimization. Built upon this explicitly collaborative architecture, we further propose an Adaptive Feature Modulation Module (AFMM) to support effective interaction. AFMM enables content-aware feature regulation by decoupling modulation structure and strength, guiding watermark embedding toward stable image features while suppressing host interference during extraction. Under CIM, the AFMMs on both sides form a closed-loop collaboration that aligns embedding behavior with extraction objectives. This architecture-level redesign changes how robustness is learned in watermarking systems. Rather than relying on exhaustive distortion simulation, robustness emerges from coordinated representation learning between embedding and extraction. Experiments on real-world and AI-generated datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in watermark extraction accuracy while maintaining high perceptual quality, showing strong robustness and generalization.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19438v1,,False
Attention Is Not What You Need,22/12/2025,Zhang Chong,"We revisit a basic question in sequence modeling: is explicit self-attention actually necessary for strong performance and reasoning? We argue that standard multi-head attention is best seen as a form of tensor lifting: hidden vectors are mapped into a high-dimensional space of pairwise interactions, and learning proceeds by constraining this lifted tensor through gradient descent. This mechanism is extremely expressive but mathematically opaque, because after many layers it becomes very hard to describe the model with a small family of explicit invariants.
  To explore an alternative, we propose an attention-free architecture based on Grassmann flows. Instead of forming an L by L attention matrix, our Causal Grassmann layer (i) linearly reduces token states, (ii) encodes local token pairs as two-dimensional subspaces on a Grassmann manifold via Plucker coordinates, and (iii) fuses these geometric features back into the hidden states through gated mixing. Information therefore propagates by controlled deformations of low-rank subspaces over multi-scale local windows, so the core computation lives on a finite-dimensional manifold rather than in an unstructured tensor space.
  On the Wikitext-2 language modeling benchmark, purely Grassmann-based models with 13 to 18 million parameters achieve validation perplexities within about 10 to 15 percent of size-matched Transformers. On the SNLI natural language inference task, a Grassmann-Plucker head on top of DistilBERT slightly outperforms a Transformer head, with best validation and test accuracies of 0.8550 and 0.8538 compared to 0.8545 and 0.8511. We analyze the complexity of Grassmann mixing, show linear scaling in sequence length for fixed rank, and argue that such manifold-based designs offer a more structured route toward geometric and invariant-based interpretations of neural reasoning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19428v1,,False
A Critical Assessment of Pattern Comparisons Between POD and Autoencoders in Intraventricular Flows,22/12/2025,"Eneko Lazpita, Andrés Bell-Navas, Jesús Garicano-Mena, Petros Koumoutsakos, Soledad Le Clainche","Understanding intraventricular hemodynamics requires compact and physically interpretable representations of the underlying flow structures, as characteristic flow patterns are closely associated with cardiovascular conditions and can support early detection of cardiac deterioration. Conventional visualization of velocity or pressure fields, however, provides limited insight into the coherent mechanisms driving these dynamics. Reduced-order modeling techniques, like Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) and Autoencoder (AE) architectures, offer powerful alternatives to extract dominant flow features from complex datasets. This study systematically compares POD with several AE variants (Linear, Nonlinear, Convolutional, and Variational) using left ventricular flow fields obtained from computational fluid dynamics simulations. We show that, for a suitably chosen latent dimension, AEs produce modes that become nearly orthogonal and qualitatively resemble POD modes that capture a given percentage of kinetic energy. As the number of latent modes increases, AE modes progressively lose orthogonality, leading to linear dependence, spatial redundancy, and the appearance of repeated modes with substantial high-frequency content. This degradation reduces interpretability and introduces noise-like components into AE-based reduced-order models, potentially complicating their integration with physics-based formulations or neural-network surrogates. The extent of interpretability loss varies across the AEs, with nonlinear, convolutional, and variational models exhibiting distinct behaviors in orthogonality preservation and feature localization. Overall, the results indicate that AEs can reproduce POD-like coherent structures under specific latent-space configurations, while highlighting the need for careful mode selection to ensure physically meaningful representations of cardiac flow dynamics.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19376v1,,False
Interpretable Hybrid Deep Q-Learning Framework for IoT-Based Food Spoilage Prediction with Synthetic Data Generation and Hardware Validation,22/12/2025,"Isshaan Singh, Divyansh Chawla, Anshu Garg, Shivin Mangal, Pallavi Gupta, Khushi Agarwal, Nimrat Singh Khalsa, Nandan Patel","The need for an intelligent, real-time spoilage prediction system has become critical in modern IoT-driven food supply chains, where perishable goods are highly susceptible to environmental conditions. Existing methods often lack adaptability to dynamic conditions and fail to optimize decision making in real time. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid reinforcement learning framework integrating Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for enhanced spoilage prediction. This hybrid architecture captures temporal dependencies within sensor data, enabling robust and adaptive decision making. In alignment with interpretable artificial intelligence principles, a rule-based classifier environment is employed to provide transparent ground truth labeling of spoilage levels based on domain-specific thresholds. This structured design allows the agent to operate within clearly defined semantic boundaries, supporting traceable and interpretable decisions. Model behavior is monitored using interpretability-driven metrics, including spoilage accuracy, reward-to-step ratio, loss reduction rate, and exploration decay. These metrics provide both quantitative performance evaluation and insights into learning dynamics. A class-wise spoilage distribution visualization is used to analyze the agents decision profile and policy behavior. Extensive evaluations on simulated and real-time hardware data demonstrate that the LSTM and RNN based agent outperforms alternative reinforcement learning approaches in prediction accuracy and decision efficiency while maintaining interpretability. The results highlight the potential of hybrid deep reinforcement learning with integrated interpretability for scalable IoT-based food monitoring systems.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19361v1,,False
Translating Flow to Policy via Hindsight Online Imitation,22/12/2025,"Yitian Zheng, Zhangchen Ye, Weijun Dong, Shengjie Wang, Yuyang Liu, Chongjie Zhang, Chuan Wen, Yang Gao","Recent advances in hierarchical robot systems leverage a high-level planner to propose task plans and a low-level policy to generate robot actions. This design allows training the planner on action-free or even non-robot data sources (e.g., videos), providing transferable high-level guidance. Nevertheless, grounding these high-level plans into executable actions remains challenging, especially with the limited availability of high-quality robot data. To this end, we propose to improve the low-level policy through online interactions. Specifically, our approach collects online rollouts, retrospectively annotates the corresponding high-level goals from achieved outcomes, and aggregates these hindsight-relabeled experiences to update a goal-conditioned imitation policy. Our method, Hindsight Flow-conditioned Online Imitation (HinFlow), instantiates this idea with 2D point flows as the high-level planner. Across diverse manipulation tasks in both simulation and physical world, our method achieves more than $2\times$ performance improvement over the base policy, significantly outperforming the existing methods. Moreover, our framework enables policy acquisition from planners trained on cross-embodiment video data, demonstrating its potential for scalable and transferable robot learning.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19269v1,,False
Beyond Sliding Windows: Learning to Manage Memory in Non-Markovian Environments,22/12/2025,"Geraud Nangue Tasse, Matthew Riemer, Benjamin Rosman, Tim Klinger","Recent success in developing increasingly general purpose agents based on sequence models has led to increased focus on the problem of deploying computationally limited agents within the vastly more complex real-world. A key challenge experienced in these more realistic domains is highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to the agent's observations, which are less common in small controlled domains. The predominant approach for dealing with this in the literature is to stack together a window of the most recent observations (Frame Stacking), but this window size must grow with the degree of non-Markovian dependencies, which results in prohibitive computational and memory requirements for both action inference and learning. In this paper, we are motivated by the insight that in many environments that are highly non-Markovian with respect to time, the environment only causally depends on a relatively small number of observations over that time-scale. A natural direction would then be to consider meta-algorithms that maintain relatively small adaptive stacks of memories such that it is possible to express highly non-Markovian dependencies with respect to time while considering fewer observations at each step and thus experience substantial savings in both compute and memory requirements. Hence, we propose a meta-algorithm (Adaptive Stacking) for achieving exactly that with convergence guarantees and quantify the reduced computation and memory constraints for MLP, LSTM, and Transformer-based agents. Our experiments utilize popular memory tasks, which give us control over the degree of non-Markovian dependencies. This allows us to demonstrate that an appropriate meta-algorithm can learn the removal of memories not predictive of future rewards without excessive removal of important experiences.

RP-CATE: Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder for Industrial Hybrid Modeling,22/12/2025,"Haoran Yang, Yinan Zhang, Wenjie Zhang, Dongxia Wang, Peiyu Liu, Yuqi Ye, Kexin Chen, Wenhai Wang","Nowadays, industrial hybrid modeling which integrates both mechanistic modeling and machine learning-based modeling techniques has attracted increasing interest from scholars due to its high accuracy, low computational cost, and satisfactory interpretability. Nevertheless, the existing industrial hybrid modeling methods still face two main limitations. First, current research has mainly focused on applying a single machine learning method to one specific task, failing to develop a comprehensive machine learning architecture suitable for modeling tasks, which limits their ability to effectively represent complex industrial scenarios. Second, industrial datasets often contain underlying associations (e.g., monotonicity or periodicity) that are not adequately exploited by current research, which can degrade model's predictive performance. To address these limitations, this paper proposes the Recurrent Perceptron-based Channel Attention Transformer Encoder (RP-CATE), with three distinctive characteristics: 1: We developed a novel architecture by replacing the self-attention mechanism with channel attention and incorporating our proposed Recurrent Perceptron (RP) Module into Transformer, achieving enhanced effectiveness for industrial modeling tasks compared to the original Transformer. 2: We proposed a new data type called Pseudo-Image Data (PID) tailored for channel attention requirements and developed a cyclic sliding window method for generating PID. 3: We introduced the concept of Pseudo-Sequential Data (PSD) and a method for converting industrial datasets into PSD, which enables the RP Module to capture the underlying associations within industrial dataset more effectively. An experiment aimed at hybrid modeling in chemical engineering was conducted by using RP-CATE and the experimental results demonstrate that RP-CATE achieves the best performance compared to other baseline models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19147v1,,False
A Composable Channel-Adaptive Architecture for Seizure Classification,22/12/2025,"Francesco Carzaniga, Michael Hersche, Kaspar Schindler, Abbas Rahimi","Objective: We develop a channel-adaptive (CA) architecture that seamlessly processes multi-variate time-series with an arbitrary number of channels, and in particular intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. Methods: Our CA architecture first processes the iEEG signal using state-of-the-art models applied to each single channel independently. The resulting features are then fused using a vector-symbolic algorithm which reconstructs the spatial relationship using a trainable scalar per channel. Finally, the fused features are accumulated in a long-term memory of up to 2 minutes to perform the classification. Each CA-model can then be pre-trained on a large corpus of iEEG recordings from multiple heterogeneous subjects. The pre-trained model is personalized to each subject via a quick fine-tuning routine, which uses equal or lower amounts of data compared to existing state-of-the-art models, but requiring only 1/5 of the time. Results: We evaluate our CA-models on a seizure detection task both on a short-term (~20 hours) and a long-term (~2500 hours) dataset. In particular, our CA-EEGWaveNet is trained on a single seizure of the tested subject, while the baseline EEGWaveNet is trained on all but one. Even in this challenging scenario, our CA-EEGWaveNet surpasses the baseline in median F1-score (0.78 vs 0.76). Similarly, CA-EEGNet based on EEGNet, also surpasses its baseline in median F1-score (0.79 vs 0.74). Conclusion and significance: Our CA-model addresses two issues: first, it is channel-adaptive and can therefore be trained across heterogeneous subjects without loss of performance; second, it increases the effective temporal context size to a clinically-relevant length. Therefore, our model is a drop-in replacement for existing models, bringing better characteristics and performance across the board.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19123v1,10.1109/JBHI.2025.3587103,False
A Surrogate-Augmented Symbolic CFD-Driven Training Framework for Accelerating Multi-objective Physical Model Development,22/12/2025,"Yuan Fang, Fabian Waschkowski, Maximilian Reissmann, Richard D. Sandberg, Takuo Oda, Koichi Tanimoto","Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)-driven training combines machine learning (ML) with CFD solvers to develop physically consistent closure models with improved predictive accuracy. In the original framework, each ML-generated candidate model is embedded in a CFD solver and evaluated against reference data, requiring hundreds to thousands of high-fidelity simulations and resulting in prohibitive computational cost for complex flows. To overcome this limitation, we propose an extended framework that integrates surrogate modeling into symbolic CFD-driven training in real time to reduce training cost. The surrogate model learns to approximate the errors of ML-generated models based on previous CFD evaluations and is continuously refined during training. Newly generated models are first assessed using the surrogate, and only those predicted to yield small errors or high uncertainty are subsequently evaluated with full CFD simulations. Discrete expressions generated by symbolic regression are mapped into a continuous space using averaged input-symbol values as inputs to a probabilistic surrogate model. To support multi-objective model training, particularly when fixed weighting of competing quantities is challenging, the surrogate is extended to a multi-output formulation by generalizing the kernel to a matrix form, providing one mean and variance prediction per training objective. Selection metrics based on these probabilistic outputs are used to identify an optimal training setup. The proposed surrogate-augmented CFD-driven training framework is demonstrated across a range of statistically one- and two-dimensional flows, including both single- and multi-expression model optimization. In all cases, the framework substantially reduces training cost while maintaining predictive accuracy comparable to that of the original CFD-driven approach.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19031v1,,False
IndoorUAV: Benchmarking Vision-Language UAV Navigation in Continuous Indoor Environments,22/12/2025,"Xu Liu, Yu Liu, Hanshuo Qiu, Yang Qirong, Zhouhui Lian","Vision-Language Navigation (VLN) enables agents to navigate in complex environments by following natural language instructions grounded in visual observations. Although most existing work has focused on ground-based robots or outdoor Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), indoor UAV-based VLN remains underexplored, despite its relevance to real-world applications such as inspection, delivery, and search-and-rescue in confined spaces. To bridge this gap, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV}, a novel benchmark and method specifically tailored for VLN with indoor UAVs. We begin by curating over 1,000 diverse and structurally rich 3D indoor scenes from the Habitat simulator. Within these environments, we simulate realistic UAV flight dynamics to collect diverse 3D navigation trajectories manually, further enriched through data augmentation techniques. Furthermore, we design an automated annotation pipeline to generate natural language instructions of varying granularity for each trajectory. This process yields over 16,000 high-quality trajectories, comprising the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLN} subset, which focuses on long-horizon VLN. To support short-horizon planning, we segment long trajectories into sub-trajectories by selecting semantically salient keyframes and regenerating concise instructions, forming the \textbf{IndoorUAV-VLA} subset. Finally, we introduce \textbf{IndoorUAV-Agent}, a novel navigation model designed for our benchmark, leveraging task decomposition and multimodal reasoning. We hope IndoorUAV serves as a valuable resource to advance research on vision-language embodied AI in the indoor aerial navigation domain.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19024v1,,False
ORPR: An OR-Guided Pretrain-then-Reinforce Learning Model for Inventory Management,22/12/2025,"Lingjie Zhao, Xue Yu, Yongzhi Qi, Hao Hu, Jianshen Zhang, Yingzheng Ma, Shuyu Han, Wei Qi, Zuo-Jun Max Shen","As the pursuit of synergy between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Operations Research (OR) gains momentum in handling complex inventory systems, a critical challenge persists: how to effectively reconcile AI's adaptive perception with OR's structural rigor. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel OR-Guided ""Pretrain-then-Reinforce"" framework. To provide structured guidance, we propose a simulation-augmented OR model that generates high-quality reference decisions, implicitly capturing complex business constraints and managerial preferences. Leveraging these OR-derived decisions as foundational training labels, we design a domain-informed deep learning foundation model to establish foundational decision-making capabilities, followed by a reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning stage. Uniquely, we position RL as a deep alignment mechanism that enables the AI agent to internalize the optimality principles of OR, while simultaneously leveraging exploration for general policy refinement and allowing expert guidance for scenario-specific adaptation (e.g., promotional events). Validated through extensive numerical experiments and a field deployment at JD.com augmented by a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) analysis, our model significantly outperforms incumbent industrial practices, delivering real-world gains of a 5.27-day reduction in turnover and a 2.29% increase in in-stock rates, alongside a 29.95% decrease in holding costs. Contrary to the prevailing trend of brute-force model scaling, our study demonstrates that a lightweight, domain-informed model can deliver state-of-the-art performance and robust transferability when guided by structured OR logic. This approach offers a scalable and cost-effective paradigm for intelligent supply chain management, highlighting the value of deeply aligning AI with OR.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.19001v1,,False
Lag Operator SSMs: A Geometric Framework for Structured State Space Modeling,22/12/2025,"Sutashu Tomonaga, Kenji Doya, Noboru Murata","Structured State Space Models (SSMs), which are at the heart of the recently popular Mamba architecture, are powerful tools for sequence modeling. However, their theoretical foundation relies on a complex, multi-stage process of continuous-time modeling and subsequent discretization, which can obscure intuition. We introduce a direct, first-principles framework for constructing discrete-time SSMs that is both flexible and modular. Our approach is based on a novel lag operator, which geometrically derives the discrete-time recurrence by measuring how the system's basis functions ""slide"" and change from one timestep to the next. The resulting state matrices are computed via a single inner product involving this operator, offering a modular design space for creating novel SSMs by flexibly combining different basis functions and time-warping schemes. To validate our approach, we demonstrate that a specific instance exactly recovers the recurrence of the influential HiPPO model. Numerical simulations confirm our derivation, providing new theoretical tools for designing flexible and robust sequence models.",https://arxiv.org/pdf/2512.18965v1,,False
