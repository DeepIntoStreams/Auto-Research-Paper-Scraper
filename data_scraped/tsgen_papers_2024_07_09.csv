Physics-Informed Machine Learning Towards A Real-Time Spacecraft Thermal Simulator,08/07/2024,"Manaswin Oddiraju, Zaki Hasnain, Saptarshi Bandyopadhyay, Eric Sunada, Souma Chowdhury","Modeling thermal states for complex space missions, such as the surface
exploration of airless bodies, requires high computation, whether used in
ground-based analysis for spacecraft design or during onboard reasoning for
autonomous operations. For example, a finite-element thermal model with
hundreds of elements can take significant time to simulate, which makes it
unsuitable for onboard reasoning during time-sensitive scenarios such as
descent and landing, proximity operations, or in-space assembly. Further, the
lack of fast and accurate thermal modeling drives thermal designs to be more
conservative and leads to spacecraft with larger mass and higher power budgets.
The emerging paradigm of physics-informed machine learning (PIML) presents a
class of hybrid modeling architectures that address this challenge by combining
simplified physics models with machine learning (ML) models resulting in models
which maintain both interpretability and robustness. Such techniques enable
designs with reduced mass and power through onboard thermal-state estimation
and control and may lead to improved onboard handling of off-nominal states,
including unplanned down-time. The PIML model or hybrid model presented here
consists of a neural network which predicts reduced nodalizations (distribution
and size of coarse mesh) given on-orbit thermal load conditions, and
subsequently a (relatively coarse) finite-difference model operates on this
mesh to predict thermal states. We compare the computational performance and
accuracy of the hybrid model to a data-driven neural net model, and a
high-fidelity finite-difference model of a prototype Earth-orbiting small
spacecraft. The PIML based active nodalization approach provides significantly
better generalization than the neural net model and coarse mesh model, while
reducing computing cost by up to 1.7x compared to the high-fidelity model.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06099v1,,False
From Loops to Oops: Fallback Behaviors of Language Models Under Uncertainty,08/07/2024,"Maor Ivgi, Ori Yoran, Jonathan Berant, Mor Geva","Large language models (LLMs) often exhibit undesirable behaviors, such as
hallucinations and sequence repetitions. We propose to view these behaviors as
fallbacks that models exhibit under uncertainty, and investigate the connection
between them. We categorize fallback behaviors -- sequence repetitions,
degenerate text, and hallucinations -- and extensively analyze them in models
from the same family that differ by the amount of pretraining tokens, parameter
count, or the inclusion of instruction-following training. Our experiments
reveal a clear and consistent ordering of fallback behaviors, across all these
axes: the more advanced an LLM is (i.e., trained on more tokens, has more
parameters, or instruction-tuned), its fallback behavior shifts from sequence
repetitions, to degenerate text, and then to hallucinations. Moreover, the same
ordering is observed throughout a single generation, even for the
best-performing models; as uncertainty increases, models shift from generating
hallucinations to producing degenerate text and then sequence repetitions.
Lastly, we demonstrate that while common decoding techniques, such as random
sampling, might alleviate some unwanted behaviors like sequence repetitions,
they increase harder-to-detect hallucinations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06071v1,,False
Learning local equivariant representations for quantum operators,08/07/2024,"Zhanghao Zhouyin, Zixi Gan, Shishir Kumar Pandey, Linfeng Zhang, Qiangqiang Gu","Predicting quantum operator matrices such as Hamiltonian, overlap, and
density matrices in the density functional theory (DFT) framework is crucial
for understanding material properties. Current methods often focus on
individual operators and struggle with efficiency and scalability for large
systems. Here we introduce a novel deep learning model, SLEM (Strictly
Localized Equivariant Message-passing) for predicting multiple quantum
operators, that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while dramatically improving
computational efficiency. SLEM's key innovation is its strict locality-based
design, constructing local, equivariant representations for quantum tensors
while preserving physical symmetries. This enables complex many-body dependence
without expanding the effective receptive field, leading to superior data
efficiency and transferability. Using an innovative SO(2) convolution
technique, SLEM reduces the computational complexity of high-order tensor
products and is therefore capable of handling systems requiring the $f$ and $g$
orbitals in their basis sets. We demonstrate SLEM's capabilities across diverse
2D and 3D materials, achieving high accuracy even with limited training data.
SLEM's design facilitates efficient parallelization, potentially extending DFT
simulations to systems with device-level sizes, opening new possibilities for
large-scale quantum simulations and high-throughput materials discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06053v1,,False
Distilling System 2 into System 1,08/07/2024,"Ping Yu, Jing Xu, Jason Weston, Ilia Kulikov","Large language models (LLMs) can spend extra compute during inference to
generate intermediate thoughts, which helps to produce better final responses.
Since Chain-of-Thought (Wei et al., 2022), many such System 2 techniques have
been proposed such as Rephrase and Respond (Deng et al., 2023a), System 2
Attention (Weston and Sukhbaatar, 2023) and Branch-Solve-Merge (Saha et al.,
2023). In this work we investigate self-supervised methods to ``compile''
(distill) higher quality outputs from System 2 techniques back into LLM
generations without intermediate reasoning token sequences, as this reasoning
has been distilled into System 1. We show that several such techniques can be
successfully distilled, resulting in improved results compared to the original
System 1 performance, and with less inference cost than System 2. We posit that
such System 2 distillation will be an important feature of future continually
learning AI systems, enabling them to focus System 2 capabilities on the
reasoning tasks that they cannot yet do well.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06023v1,,False
Simulation-based Benchmarking for Causal Structure Learning in Gene Perturbation Experiments,08/07/2024,"Luka Kovačević, Izzy Newsham, Sach Mukherjee, John Whittaker","Causal structure learning (CSL) refers to the task of learning causal
relationships from data. Advances in CSL now allow learning of causal graphs in
diverse application domains, which has the potential to facilitate data-driven
causal decision-making. Real-world CSL performance depends on a number of
$\textit{context-specific}$ factors, including context-specific data
distributions and non-linear dependencies, that are important in practical
use-cases. However, our understanding of how to assess and select CSL methods
in specific contexts remains limited. To address this gap, we present
$\textit{CausalRegNet}$, a multiplicative effect structural causal model that
allows for generating observational and interventional data incorporating
context-specific properties, with a focus on the setting of gene perturbation
experiments. Using real-world gene perturbation data, we show that CausalRegNet
generates accurate distributions and scales far better than current simulation
frameworks. We illustrate the use of CausalRegNet in assessing CSL methods in
the context of interventional experiments in biology.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.06015v1,,False
Change-Point Detection in Industrial Data Streams based on Online Dynamic Mode Decomposition with Control,08/07/2024,"Marek Wadinger, Michal Kvasnica, Yoshinobu Kawahara","We propose a novel change-point detection method based on online Dynamic Mode
Decomposition with control (ODMDwC). Leveraging ODMDwC's ability to find and
track linear approximation of a non-linear system while incorporating control
effects, the proposed method dynamically adapts to its changing behavior due to
aging and seasonality. This approach enables the detection of changes in
spatial, temporal, and spectral patterns, providing a robust solution that
preserves correspondence between the score and the extent of change in the
system dynamics. We formulate a truncated version of ODMDwC and utilize
higher-order time-delay embeddings to mitigate noise and extract broad-band
features. Our method addresses the challenges faced in industrial settings
where safety-critical systems generate non-uniform data streams while requiring
timely and accurate change-point detection to protect profit and life. Our
results demonstrate that this method yields intuitive and improved detection
results compared to the Singular-Value-Decomposition-based method. We validate
our approach using synthetic and real-world data, showing its competitiveness
to other approaches on complex systems' benchmark datasets. Provided guidelines
for hyperparameters selection enhance our method's practical applicability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05976v1,,False
Structural Generalization in Autonomous Cyber Incident Response with Message-Passing Neural Networks and Reinforcement Learning,08/07/2024,"Jakob Nyberg, Pontus Johnson","We believe that agents for automated incident response based on machine
learning need to handle changes in network structure. Computer networks are
dynamic, and can naturally change in structure over time. Retraining agents for
small network changes costs time and energy. We attempt to address this issue
with an existing method of relational agent learning, where the relations
between objects are assumed to remain consistent across problem instances. The
state of the computer network is represented as a relational graph and encoded
through a message passing neural network. The message passing neural network
and an agent policy using the encoding are optimized end-to-end using
reinforcement learning. We evaluate the approach on the second instance of the
Cyber Autonomy Gym for Experimentation (CAGE~2), a cyber incident simulator
that simulates attacks on an enterprise network. We create variants of the
original network with different numbers of hosts and agents are tested without
additional training on them. Our results show that agents using relational
information are able to find solutions despite changes to the network, and can
perform optimally in some instances. Agents using the default vector state
representation perform better, but need to be specially trained on each network
variant, demonstrating a trade-off between specialization and generalization.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05775v1,,False
TransMA: an explainable multi-modal deep learning model for predicting properties of ionizable lipid nanoparticles in mRNA delivery,08/07/2024,"Kun Wu, Zixu Wang, Xiulong Yang, Yangyang Chen, Zhenqi Han, Jialu Zhang, Lizhuang Liu","As the primary mRNA delivery vehicles, ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs)
exhibit excellent safety, high transfection efficiency, and strong immune
response induction. However, the screening process for LNPs is time-consuming
and costly. To expedite the identification of high-transfection-efficiency mRNA
drug delivery systems, we propose an explainable LNPs transfection efficiency
prediction model, called TransMA. TransMA employs a multi-modal molecular
structure fusion architecture, wherein the fine-grained atomic spatial
relationship extractor named molecule 3D Transformer captures three-dimensional
spatial features of the molecule, and the coarse-grained atomic sequence
extractor named molecule Mamba captures one-dimensional molecular features. We
design the mol-attention mechanism block, enabling it to align coarse and
fine-grained atomic features and captures relationships between atomic spatial
and sequential structures. TransMA achieves state-of-the-art performance in
predicting transfection efficiency using the scaffold and cliff data splitting
methods on the current largest LNPs dataset, including Hela and RAW cell lines.
Moreover, we find that TransMA captures the relationship between subtle
structural changes and significant transfection efficiency variations,
providing valuable insights for LNPs design. Additionally, TransMA's
predictions on external transfection efficiency data maintain a consistent
order with actual transfection efficiencies, demonstrating its robust
generalization capability. The code, model and data are made publicly available
at https://github.com/wklix/TransMA/tree/master. We hope that high-accuracy
transfection prediction models in the future can aid in LNPs design and initial
screening, thereby assisting in accelerating the mRNA design process.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05736v1,,False
Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Neural Network for Uncertainty Quantification in Transonic Aerodynamic Loads,08/07/2024,"Andrea Vaiuso, Gabriele Immordino, Marcello Righi, Andrea Da Ronch","Multi-fidelity models are becoming more prevalent in engineering,
particularly in aerospace, as they combine both the computational efficiency of
low-fidelity models with the high accuracy of higher-fidelity simulations.
Various state-of-the-art techniques exist for fusing data from different
fidelity sources, including Co-Kriging and transfer learning in neural
networks. This paper aims to implement a multi-fidelity Bayesian neural network
model that applies transfer learning to fuse data generated by models at
different fidelities. Bayesian neural networks use probability distributions
over network weights, enabling them to provide predictions along with estimates
of their confidence. This approach harnesses the predictive and data fusion
capabilities of neural networks while also quantifying uncertainty. The results
demonstrate that the multi-fidelity Bayesian model outperforms the
state-of-the-art Co-Kriging in terms of overall accuracy and robustness on
unseen data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05684v1,,False
RadiomicsFill-Mammo: Synthetic Mammogram Mass Manipulation with Radiomics Features,08/07/2024,"Inye Na, Jonghun Kim, Eun Sook Ko, Hyunjin Park","Motivated by the question, ""Can we generate tumors with desired attributes?''
this study leverages radiomics features to explore the feasibility of
generating synthetic tumor images. Characterized by its low-dimensional yet
biologically meaningful markers, radiomics bridges the gap between complex
medical imaging data and actionable clinical insights. We present
RadiomicsFill-Mammo, the first of the RadiomicsFill series, an innovative
technique that generates realistic mammogram mass images mirroring specific
radiomics attributes using masked images and opposite breast images, leveraging
a recent stable diffusion model. This approach also allows for the
incorporation of essential clinical variables, such as BI-RADS and breast
density, alongside radiomics features as conditions for mass generation.
Results indicate that RadiomicsFill-Mammo effectively generates diverse and
realistic tumor images based on various radiomics conditions. Results also
demonstrate a significant improvement in mass detection capabilities,
leveraging RadiomicsFill-Mammo as a strategy to generate simulated samples.
Furthermore, RadiomicsFill-Mammo not only advances medical imaging research but
also opens new avenues for enhancing treatment planning and tumor simulation.

BEVWorld: A Multimodal World Model for Autonomous Driving via Unified BEV Latent Space,08/07/2024,"Yumeng Zhang, Shi Gong, Kaixin Xiong, Xiaoqing Ye, Xiao Tan, Fan Wang, Jizhou Huang, Hua Wu, Haifeng Wang","World models are receiving increasing attention in autonomous driving for
their ability to predict potential future scenarios. In this paper, we present
BEVWorld, a novel approach that tokenizes multimodal sensor inputs into a
unified and compact Bird's Eye View (BEV) latent space for environment
modeling. The world model consists of two parts: the multi-modal tokenizer and
the latent BEV sequence diffusion model. The multi-modal tokenizer first
encodes multi-modality information and the decoder is able to reconstruct the
latent BEV tokens into LiDAR and image observations by ray-casting rendering in
a self-supervised manner. Then the latent BEV sequence diffusion model predicts
future scenarios given action tokens as conditions. Experiments demonstrate the
effectiveness of BEVWorld in autonomous driving tasks, showcasing its
capability in generating future scenes and benefiting downstream tasks such as
perception and motion prediction. Code will be available at

MSTF: Multiscale Transformer for Incomplete Trajectory Prediction,08/07/2024,"Zhanwen Liu, Chao Li, Nan Yang, Yang Wang, Jiaqi Ma, Guangliang Cheng, Xiangmo Zhao","Motion forecasting plays a pivotal role in autonomous driving systems,
enabling vehicles to execute collision warnings and rational local-path
planning based on predictions of the surrounding vehicles. However, prevalent
methods often assume complete observed trajectories, neglecting the potential
impact of missing values induced by object occlusion, scope limitation, and
sensor failures. Such oversights inevitably compromise the accuracy of
trajectory predictions. To tackle this challenge, we propose an end-to-end
framework, termed Multiscale Transformer (MSTF), meticulously crafted for
incomplete trajectory prediction. MSTF integrates a Multiscale Attention Head
(MAH) and an Information Increment-based Pattern Adaptive (IIPA) module.
Specifically, the MAH component concurrently captures multiscale motion
representation of trajectory sequence from various temporal granularities,
utilizing a multi-head attention mechanism. This approach facilitates the
modeling of global dependencies in motion across different scales, thereby
mitigating the adverse effects of missing values. Additionally, the IIPA module
adaptively extracts continuity representation of motion across time steps by
analyzing missing patterns in the data. The continuity representation
delineates motion trend at a higher level, guiding MSTF to generate predictions
consistent with motion continuity. We evaluate our proposed MSTF model using
two large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that MSTF
surpasses state-of-the-art (SOTA) models in the task of incomplete trajectory
prediction, showcasing its efficacy in addressing the challenges posed by
missing values in motion forecasting for autonomous driving systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05671v1,,False
Deep Learning-based Anomaly Detection and Log Analysis for Computer Networks,08/07/2024,"Shuzhan Wang, Ruxue Jiang, Zhaoqi Wang, Yan Zhou","Computer network anomaly detection and log analysis, as an important topic in
the field of network security, has been a key task to ensure network security
and system reliability. First, existing network anomaly detection and log
analysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex
network topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive
rates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle
time-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis.
Therefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these
problems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an
innovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative
Adversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a
unique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data
points, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data
distribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the
Transformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data.
The synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust
in anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of
this fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results
show that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection
while reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network
problems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and
is able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the
stability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces
advanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log
analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.05639v1,,False
