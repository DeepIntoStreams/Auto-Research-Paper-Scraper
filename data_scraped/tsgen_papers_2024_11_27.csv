Evolving Markov Chains: Unsupervised Mode Discovery and Recognition from Data Streams,26/11/2024,"Kutalmış Coşkun, Borahan Tümer, Bjarne C. Hiller, Martin Becker","Markov chains are simple yet powerful mathematical structures to model
temporally dependent processes. They generally assume stationary data, i.e.,
fixed transition probabilities between observations/states. However, live,
real-world processes, like in the context of activity tracking, biological time
series, or industrial monitoring, often switch behavior over time. Such
behavior switches can be modeled as transitions between higher-level
\emph{modes} (e.g., running, walking, etc.). Yet all modes are usually not
previously known, often exhibit vastly differing transition probabilities, and
can switch unpredictably. Thus, to track behavior changes of live, real-world
processes, this study proposes an online and efficient method to construct
Evolving Markov chains (EMCs). EMCs adaptively track transition probabilities,
automatically discover modes, and detect mode switches in an online manner. In
contrast to previous work, EMCs are of arbitrary order, the proposed update
scheme does not rely on tracking windows, only updates the relevant region of
the probability tensor, and enjoys geometric convergence of the expected
estimates. Our evaluation of synthetic data and real-world applications on
human activity recognition, electric motor condition monitoring, and eye-state
recognition from electroencephalography (EEG) measurements illustrates the
versatility of the approach and points to the potential of EMCs to efficiently
track, model, and understand live, real-world processes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17528v1,,False
Time-Series Forecasting in Smart Manufacturing Systems: An Experimental Evaluation of the State-of-the-art Algorithms,26/11/2024,"Mojtaba A. Farahani, Fadi El Kalach, Austin Harper, M. R. McCormick, Ramy Harik, Thorsten Wuest","TSF is growing in various domains including manufacturing. Although numerous
TSF algorithms have been developed recently, the validation and evaluation of
algorithms hold substantial value for researchers and practitioners and are
missing. This study aims to fill this gap by evaluating the SoTA TSF algorithms
on thirteen manufacturing datasets, focusing on their applicability in
manufacturing. Each algorithm was selected based on its TSF category to ensure
a representative set of algorithms. The evaluation includes different scenarios
to evaluate the models using two problem categories and two forecasting
horizons. To evaluate the performance, the WAPE was calculated, and additional
post hoc analyses were conducted to assess the significance of observed
differences. Only algorithms with codes from open-source libraries were
utilized, and no hyperparameter tuning was done. This allowed us to evaluate
the algorithms as ""out-of-the-box"" solutions that can be easily implemented,
ensuring their usability within the manufacturing by practitioners with limited
technical knowledge. This aligns to facilitate the adoption of these techniques
in smart manufacturing systems. Based on the results, transformer and MLP-based
architectures demonstrated the best performance with MLP-based architecture
winning the most scenarios. For univariate TSF, PatchTST emerged as the most
robust, particularly for long-term horizons, while for multivariate problems,
MLP-based architectures like N-HITS and TiDE showed superior results. The study
revealed that simpler algorithms like XGBoost could outperform complex
algorithms in certain tasks. These findings challenge the assumption that more
sophisticated models produce better results. Additionally, the research
highlighted the importance of computational resource considerations, showing
variations in runtime and memory usage across different algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17499v1,,False
A Generalized Unified Skew-Normal Process with Neural Bayes Inference,26/11/2024,"Kesen Wang, Marc G. Genton","In recent decades, statisticians have been increasingly encountering spatial
data that exhibit non-Gaussian behaviors such as asymmetry and
heavy-tailedness. As a result, the assumptions of symmetry and fixed tail
weight in Gaussian processes have become restrictive and may fail to capture
the intrinsic properties of the data. To address the limitations of the
Gaussian models, a variety of skewed models has been proposed, of which the
popularity has grown rapidly. These skewed models introduce parameters that
govern skewness and tail weight. Among various proposals in the literature,
unified skewed distributions, such as the Unified Skew-Normal (SUN), have
received considerable attention. In this work, we revisit a more concise and
intepretable re-parameterization of the SUN distribution and apply the
distribution to random fields by constructing a generalized unified skew-normal
(GSUN) spatial process. We demonstrate { that the GSUN is a valid spatial
process by showing its vanishing correlation in large distances} and provide
the corresponding spatial interpolation method. In addition, we develop an
inference mechanism for the GSUN process using the concept of neural Bayes
estimators with deep graphical attention networks (GATs) and encoder
transformer. We show the superiority of our proposed estimator over the
conventional CNN-based architectures regarding stability and accuracy by means
of a simulation study and application to Pb-contaminated soil data.
Furthermore, we show that the GSUN process is different from the conventional
Gaussian processes and Tukey g-and-h processes, through the probability
integral transform (PIT).",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17400v1,,False
PIM-AI: A Novel Architecture for High-Efficiency LLM Inference,26/11/2024,"Cristobal Ortega, Yann Falevoz, Renaud Ayrignac","Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential in a variety of
applications due to their advanced language understanding and generation
capabilities. However, their computational and memory requirements pose
significant challenges to traditional hardware architectures.
Processing-in-Memory (PIM), which integrates computational units directly into
memory chips, offers several advantages for LLM inference, including reduced
data transfer bottlenecks and improved power efficiency.
  This paper introduces PIM-AI, a novel DDR5/LPDDR5 PIM architecture designed
for LLM inference without modifying the memory controller or DDR/LPDDR memory
PHY. We have developed a simulator to evaluate the performance of PIM-AI in
various scenarios and demonstrate its significant advantages over conventional
architectures. In cloud-based scenarios, PIM-AI reduces the 3-year TCO per
queries-per-second by up to 6.94x compared to state-of-the-art GPUs, depending
on the LLM model used. In mobile scenarios, PIM-AI achieves a 10- to 20-fold
reduction in energy per token compared to state-of-the-art mobile SoCs,
resulting in 25 to 45~\% more queries per second and 6.9x to 13.4x less energy
per query, extending battery life and enabling more inferences per charge.
  These results highlight PIM-AI's potential to revolutionize LLM deployments,
making them more efficient, scalable, and sustainable.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17309v1,,False
GraphSubDetector: Time Series Subsequence Anomaly Detection via Density-Aware Adaptive Graph Neural Network,26/11/2024,"Weiqi Chen, Zhiqiang Zhou, Qingsong Wen, Liang Sun","Time series subsequence anomaly detection is an important task in a large
variety of real-world applications ranging from health monitoring to AIOps, and
is challenging due to the following reasons: 1) how to effectively learn
complex dynamics and dependencies in time series; 2) diverse and complicated
anomalous subsequences as well as the inherent variance and noise of normal
patterns; 3) how to determine the proper subsequence length for effective
detection, which is a required parameter for many existing algorithms. In this
paper, we present a novel approach to subsequence anomaly detection, namely
GraphSubDetector. First, it adaptively learns the appropriate subsequence
length with a length selection mechanism that highlights the characteristics of
both normal and anomalous patterns. Second, we propose a density-aware adaptive
graph neural network (DAGNN), which can generate further robust representations
against variance of normal data for anomaly detection by message passing
between subsequences. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed algorithm, which achieves superior performance on multiple time
series anomaly benchmark datasets compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17218v1,,False
P2DFlow: A Protein Ensemble Generative Model with SE(3) Flow Matching,26/11/2024,"Yaowei Jin, Qi Huang, Ziyang Song, Mingyue Zheng, Dan Teng, Qian Shi","Biological processes, functions, and properties are intricately linked to the
ensemble of protein conformations, rather than being solely determined by a
single stable conformation. In this study, we have developed P2DFlow, a
generative model based on SE(3) flow matching, to predict the structural
ensembles of proteins. We specifically designed a valuable prior for the flow
process and enhanced the model's ability to distinguish each intermediate state
by incorporating an additional dimension to describe the ensemble data, which
can reflect the physical laws governing the distribution of ensembles, so that
the prior knowledge can effectively guide the generation process. When trained
and evaluated on the MD datasets of ATLAS, P2DFlow outperforms other baseline
models on extensive experiments, successfully capturing the observable dynamic
fluctuations as evidenced in crystal structure and MD simulations. As a
potential proxy agent for protein molecular simulation, the high-quality
ensembles generated by P2DFlow could significantly aid in understanding protein
functions across various scenarios. Code is available at

Learning Monotonic Attention in Transducer for Streaming Generation,26/11/2024,"Zhengrui Ma, Yang Feng, Min Zhang","Streaming generation models are increasingly utilized across various fields,
with the Transducer architecture being particularly popular in industrial
applications. However, its input-synchronous decoding mechanism presents
challenges in tasks requiring non-monotonic alignments, such as simultaneous
translation, leading to suboptimal performance in these contexts. In this
research, we address this issue by tightly integrating Transducer's decoding
with the history of input stream via a learnable monotonic attention mechanism.
Our approach leverages the forward-backward algorithm to infer the posterior
probability of alignments between the predictor states and input timestamps,
which is then used to estimate the context representations of monotonic
attention in training. This allows Transducer models to adaptively adjust the
scope of attention based on their predictions, avoiding the need to enumerate
the exponentially large alignment space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our MonoAttn-Transducer significantly enhances the handling of non-monotonic
alignments in streaming generation, offering a robust solution for
Transducer-based frameworks to tackle more complex streaming generation tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17170v1,,False
X-MeshGraphNet: Scalable Multi-Scale Graph Neural Networks for Physics Simulation,26/11/2024,Mohammad Amin Nabian,"Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have gained significant traction for simulating
complex physical systems, with models like MeshGraphNet demonstrating strong
performance on unstructured simulation meshes. However, these models face
several limitations, including scalability issues, requirement for meshing at
inference, and challenges in handling long-range interactions. In this work, we
introduce X-MeshGraphNet, a scalable, multi-scale extension of MeshGraphNet
designed to address these challenges.
  X-MeshGraphNet overcomes the scalability bottleneck by partitioning large
graphs and incorporating halo regions that enable seamless message passing
across partitions. This, combined with gradient aggregation, ensures that
training across partitions is equivalent to processing the entire graph at
once. To remove the dependency on simulation meshes, X-MeshGraphNet constructs
custom graphs directly from CAD files by generating uniform point clouds on the
surface or volume of the object and connecting k-nearest neighbors.
Additionally, our model builds multi-scale graphs by iteratively combining
coarse and fine-resolution point clouds, where each level refines the previous,
allowing for efficient long-range interactions.
  Our experiments demonstrate that X-MeshGraphNet maintains the predictive
accuracy of full-graph GNNs while significantly improving scalability and
flexibility. This approach eliminates the need for time-consuming mesh
generation at inference, offering a practical solution for real-time simulation
across a wide range of applications. The code for reproducing the results
presented in this paper is available through NVIDIA Modulus:

Emergenet: A Digital Twin of Sequence Evolution for Scalable Emergence Risk Assessment of Animal Influenza A Strains,26/11/2024,"Kevin Yuanbo Wu, Jin Li, Aaron Esser-Kahn, Ishanu Chattopadhyay","Despite having triggered devastating pandemics in the past, our ability to
quantitatively assess the emergence potential of individual strains of animal
influenza viruses remains limited. This study introduces Emergenet, a tool to
infer a digital twin of sequence evolution to chart how new variants might
emerge in the wild. Our predictions based on Emergenets built only using
220,151 Hemagglutinnin (HA) sequences consistently outperform WHO seasonal
vaccine recommendations for H1N1/H3N2 subtypes over two decades (average
match-improvement: 3.73 AAs, 28.40\%), and are at par with state-of-the-art
approaches that use more detailed phenotypic annotations. Finally, our
generative models are used to scalably calculate the current odds of emergence
of animal strains not yet in human circulation, which strongly correlates with
CDC's expert-assessed Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT) scores (Pearson's
$r = 0.721, p = 10^{-4}$). A minimum five orders of magnitude speedup over
CDC's assessment (seconds vs months) then enabled us to analyze 6,354 animal
strains collected post-2020 to identify 35 strains with high emergence scores
($> 7.7$). The Emergenet framework opens the door to preemptive pandemic
mitigation through targeted inoculation of animal hosts before the first human
infection.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17154v1,,False
Creative Agents: Simulating the Systems Model of Creativity with Generative Agents,26/11/2024,"Naomi Imasato, Kazuki Miyazawa, Takayuki Nagai, Takato Horii","With the growing popularity of generative AI for images, video, and music, we
witnessed models rapidly improve in quality and performance. However, not much
attention is paid towards enabling AI's ability to ""be creative"". In this
study, we implemented and simulated the systems model of creativity (proposed
by Csikszentmihalyi) using virtual agents utilizing large language models
(LLMs) and text prompts. For comparison, the simulations were conducted with
the ""virtual artists"" being: 1)isolated and 2)placed in a multi-agent system.
Both scenarios were compared by analyzing the variations and overall
""creativity"" in the generated artifacts (measured via a user study and LLM).
Our results suggest that the generative agents may perform better in the
framework of the systems model of creativity.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17065v1,,False
A generalised novel loss function for computational fluid dynamics,26/11/2024,"Zachary Cooper-Baldock, Paulo E. Santos, Russell S. A. Brinkworth, Karl Sammut","Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations are crucial in automotive,
aerospace, maritime and medical applications, but are limited by the
complexity, cost and computational requirements of directly calculating the
flow, often taking days of compute time. Machine-learning architectures, such
as controlled generative adversarial networks (cGANs) hold significant
potential in enhancing or replacing CFD investigations, due to cGANs ability to
approximate the underlying data distribution of a dataset. Unlike traditional
cGAN applications, where the entire image carries information, CFD data
contains small regions of highly variant data, immersed in a large context of
low variance that is of minimal importance. This renders most existing deep
learning techniques that give equal importance to every portion of the data
during training, inefficient. To mitigate this, a novel loss function is
proposed called Gradient Mean Squared Error (GMSE) which automatically and
dynamically identifies the regions of importance on a field-by-field basis,
assigning appropriate weights according to the local variance. To assess the
effectiveness of the proposed solution, three identical networks were trained;
optimised with Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss, proposed GMSE loss and a dynamic
variant of GMSE (DGMSE). The novel loss function resulted in faster loss
convergence, correlating to reduced training time, whilst also displaying an
83.6% reduction in structural similarity error between the generated field and
ground truth simulations, a 76.6% higher maximum rate of loss and an increased
ability to fool a discriminator network. It is hoped that this loss function
will enable accelerated machine learning within computational fluid dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17059v1,,False
Conformalised Conditional Normalising Flows for Joint Prediction Regions in time series,26/11/2024,"Eshant English, Christoph Lippert","Conformal Prediction offers a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, enabling the construction of prediction sets with
finite-sample validity guarantees. While easily adaptable to non-probabilistic
models, applying conformal prediction to probabilistic generative models, such
as Normalising Flows is not straightforward. This work proposes a novel method
to conformalise conditional normalising flows, specifically addressing the
problem of obtaining prediction regions for multi-step time series forecasting.
Our approach leverages the flexibility of normalising flows to generate
potentially disjoint prediction regions, leading to improved predictive
efficiency in the presence of potential multimodal predictive distributions.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.17042v1,,False
CRASH: Challenging Reinforcement-Learning Based Adversarial Scenarios For Safety Hardening,26/11/2024,"Amar Kulkarni, Shangtong Zhang, Madhur Behl","Ensuring the safety of autonomous vehicles (AVs) requires identifying rare
but critical failure cases that on-road testing alone cannot discover.
High-fidelity simulations provide a scalable alternative, but automatically
generating realistic and diverse traffic scenarios that can effectively stress
test AV motion planners remains a key challenge. This paper introduces CRASH -
Challenging Reinforcement-learning based Adversarial scenarios for Safety
Hardening - an adversarial deep reinforcement learning framework to address
this issue. First CRASH can control adversarial Non Player Character (NPC)
agents in an AV simulator to automatically induce collisions with the Ego
vehicle, falsifying its motion planner. We also propose a novel approach, that
we term safety hardening, which iteratively refines the motion planner by
simulating improvement scenarios against adversarial agents, leveraging the
failure cases to strengthen the AV stack. CRASH is evaluated on a simplified
two-lane highway scenario, demonstrating its ability to falsify both rule-based
and learning-based planners with collision rates exceeding 90%. Additionally,
safety hardening reduces the Ego vehicle's collision rate by 26%. While
preliminary, these results highlight RL-based safety hardening as a promising
approach for scenario-driven simulation testing for autonomous vehicles.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2411.16996v1,,False
