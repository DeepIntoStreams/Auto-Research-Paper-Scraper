Value Profiles for Encoding Human Variation,19/03/2025,"Taylor Sorensen, Pushkar Mishra, Roma Patel, Michael Henry Tessler, Michiel Bakker, Georgina Evans, Iason Gabriel, Noah Goodman, Verena Rieser","Modelling human variation in rating tasks is crucial for enabling AI systems
for personalization, pluralistic model alignment, and computational social
science. We propose representing individuals using value profiles -- natural
language descriptions of underlying values compressed from in-context
demonstrations -- along with a steerable decoder model to estimate ratings
conditioned on a value profile or other rater information. To measure the
predictive information in rater representations, we introduce an
information-theoretic methodology. We find that demonstrations contain the most
information, followed by value profiles and then demographics. However, value
profiles offer advantages in terms of scrutability, interpretability, and
steerability due to their compressed natural language format. Value profiles
effectively compress the useful information from demonstrations (>70%
information preservation). Furthermore, clustering value profiles to identify
similarly behaving individuals better explains rater variation than the most
predictive demographic groupings. Going beyond test set performance, we show
that the decoder models interpretably change ratings according to semantic
profile differences, are well-calibrated, and can help explain instance-level
disagreement by simulating an annotator population. These results demonstrate
that value profiles offer novel, predictive ways to describe individual
variation beyond demographics or group information.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15484v1,,False
Learning to Play Piano in the Real World,19/03/2025,"Yves-Simon Zeulner, Sandeep Selvaraj, Roberto Calandra","Towards the grand challenge of achieving human-level manipulation in robots,
playing piano is a compelling testbed that requires strategic, precise, and
flowing movements. Over the years, several works demonstrated hand-designed
controllers on real world piano playing, while other works evaluated robot
learning approaches on simulated piano scenarios. In this paper, we develop the
first piano playing robotic system that makes use of learning approaches while
also being deployed on a real world dexterous robot. Specifically, we make use
of Sim2Real to train a policy in simulation using reinforcement learning before
deploying the learned policy on a real world dexterous robot. In our
experiments, we thoroughly evaluate the interplay between domain randomization
and the accuracy of the dynamics model used in simulation. Moreover, we
evaluate the robot's performance across multiple songs with varying complexity
to study the generalization of our learned policy. By providing a
proof-of-concept of learning to play piano in the real world, we want to
encourage the community to adopt piano playing as a compelling benchmark
towards human-level manipulation. We open-source our code and show additional

A Foundation Model for Patient Behavior Monitoring and Suicide Detection,19/03/2025,"Rodrigo Oliver, Josué Pérez-Sabater, Leire Paz-Arbaizar, Alejandro Lancho, Antonio Artés, Pablo M. Olmos","Foundation models (FMs) have achieved remarkable success across various
domains, yet their adoption in healthcare remains limited. While significant
advances have been made in medical imaging, genetic biomarkers, and time series
from electronic health records, the potential of FMs for patient behavior
monitoring through wearable devices remains underexplored. These datasets are
inherently heterogeneous, multisource, and often exhibit high rates of missing
data, posing unique challenges. This paper introduces a novel FM based on a
modified vector quantized variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), specifically
designed to process real-world data from wearable devices. We demonstrate that
our pretrained FM, trained on a broad cohort of psychiatric patients, performs
downstream tasks via its latent representation without fine-tuning on a
held-out cohort of suicidal patients. To illustrate this, we develop a
probabilistic change-point detection algorithm for suicide detection and
demonstrate the FM's effectiveness in predicting emotional states. Our results
show that the discrete latent structure of the VQ-VAE outperforms a
state-of-the-art Informer architecture in unsupervised suicide detection, while
matching its performance in supervised emotion prediction when the latent
dimensionality is increased, though at the cost of reduced unsupervised
accuracy. This trade-off highlights the need for future FMs to integrate hybrid
discrete-continuous structures for balanced performance across tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15221v1,,False
Online federated learning framework for classification,19/03/2025,"Wenxing Guo, Jinhan Xie, Jianya Lu, Bei jiang, Hongsheng Dai, Linglong Kong","In this paper, we develop a novel online federated learning framework for
classification, designed to handle streaming data from multiple clients while
ensuring data privacy and computational efficiency. Our method leverages the
generalized distance-weighted discriminant technique, making it robust to both
homogeneous and heterogeneous data distributions across clients. In particular,
we develop a new optimization algorithm based on the Majorization-Minimization
principle, integrated with a renewable estimation procedure, enabling efficient
model updates without full retraining. We provide a theoretical guarantee for
the convergence of our estimator, proving its consistency and asymptotic
normality under standard regularity conditions. In addition, we establish that
our method achieves Bayesian risk consistency, ensuring its reliability for
classification tasks in federated environments. We further incorporate
differential privacy mechanisms to enhance data security, protecting client
information while maintaining model performance. Extensive numerical
experiments on both simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
approach delivers high classification accuracy, significant computational
efficiency gains, and substantial savings in data storage requirements compared
to existing methods.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15210v1,,False
"A Unified Framework for Real-Time Failure Handling in Robotics Using Vision-Language Models, Reactive Planner and Behavior Trees",19/03/2025,"Faseeh Ahmad, Hashim Ismail, Jonathan Styrud, Maj Stenmark, Volker Krueger","Robotic systems often face execution failures due to unexpected obstacles,
sensor errors, or environmental changes. Traditional failure recovery methods
rely on predefined strategies or human intervention, making them less
adaptable. This paper presents a unified failure recovery framework that
combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs), a reactive planner, and Behavior Trees
(BTs) to enable real-time failure handling. Our approach includes pre-execution
verification, which checks for potential failures before execution, and
reactive failure handling, which detects and corrects failures during execution
by verifying existing BT conditions, adding missing preconditions and, when
necessary, generating new skills. The framework uses a scene graph for
structured environmental perception and an execution history for continuous
monitoring, enabling context-aware and adaptive failure handling. We evaluate
our framework through real-world experiments with an ABB YuMi robot on tasks
like peg insertion, object sorting, and drawer placement, as well as in
AI2-THOR simulator. Compared to using pre-execution and reactive methods
separately, our approach achieves higher task success rates and greater
adaptability. Ablation studies highlight the importance of VLM-based reasoning,
structured scene representation, and execution history tracking for effective
failure recovery in robotics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15202v1,,False
Volumetric Reconstruction From Partial Views for Task-Oriented Grasping,19/03/2025,"Fujian Yan, Hui Li, Hongsheng He","Object affordance and volumetric information are essential in devising
effective grasping strategies under task-specific constraints. This paper
presents an approach for inferring suitable grasping strategies from limited
partial views of an object. To achieve this, a recurrent generative adversarial
network (R-GAN) was proposed by incorporating a recurrent generator with long
short-term memory (LSTM) units for it to process a variable number of depth
scans. To determine object affordances, the AffordPose knowledge dataset is
utilized as prior knowledge. Affordance retrieving is defined by the volume
similarity measured via Chamfer Distance and action similarities. A Proximal
Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning model is further implemented
to refine the retrieved grasp strategies for task-oriented grasping. The
retrieved grasp strategies were evaluated on a dual-arm mobile manipulation
robot with an overall grasping accuracy of 89% for four tasks: lift, handle
grasp, wrap grasp, and press.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15167v1,,False
Machine learning surrogate models of many-body dispersion interactions in polymer melts,19/03/2025,"Zhaoxiang Shen, Raúl I. Sosa, Jakub Lengiewicz, Alexandre Tkatchenko, Stéphane P. A. Bordas","Accurate prediction of many-body dispersion (MBD) interactions is essential
for understanding the van der Waals forces that govern the behavior of many
complex molecular systems. However, the high computational cost of MBD
calculations limits their direct application in large-scale simulations. In
this work, we introduce a machine learning surrogate model specifically
designed to predict MBD forces in polymer melts, a system that demands accurate
MBD description and offers structural advantages for machine learning
approaches. Our model is based on a trimmed SchNet architecture that
selectively retains the most relevant atomic connections and incorporates
trainable radial basis functions for geometric encoding. We validate our
surrogate model on datasets from polyethylene, polypropylene, and polyvinyl
chloride melts, demonstrating high predictive accuracy and robust
generalization across diverse polymer systems. In addition, the model captures
key physical features, such as the characteristic decay behavior of MBD
interactions, providing valuable insights for optimizing cutoff strategies.
Characterized by high computational efficiency, our surrogate model enables
practical incorporation of MBD effects into large-scale molecular simulations.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15149v1,,False
Text-Derived Relational Graph-Enhanced Network for Skeleton-Based Action Segmentation,19/03/2025,"Haoyu Ji, Bowen Chen, Weihong Ren, Wenze Huang, Zhihao Yang, Zhiyong Wang, Honghai Liu","Skeleton-based Temporal Action Segmentation (STAS) aims to segment and
recognize various actions from long, untrimmed sequences of human skeletal
movements. Current STAS methods typically employ spatio-temporal modeling to
establish dependencies among joints as well as frames, and utilize one-hot
encoding with cross-entropy loss for frame-wise classification supervision.
However, these methods overlook the intrinsic correlations among joints and
actions within skeletal features, leading to a limited understanding of human
movements. To address this, we propose a Text-Derived Relational Graph-Enhanced
Network (TRG-Net) that leverages prior graphs generated by Large Language
Models (LLM) to enhance both modeling and supervision. For modeling, the
Dynamic Spatio-Temporal Fusion Modeling (DSFM) method incorporates Text-Derived
Joint Graphs (TJG) with channel- and frame-level dynamic adaptation to
effectively model spatial relations, while integrating spatio-temporal core
features during temporal modeling. For supervision, the Absolute-Relative
Inter-Class Supervision (ARIS) method employs contrastive learning between
action features and text embeddings to regularize the absolute class
distributions, and utilizes Text-Derived Action Graphs (TAG) to capture the
relative inter-class relationships among action features. Additionally, we
propose a Spatial-Aware Enhancement Processing (SAEP) method, which
incorporates random joint occlusion and axial rotation to enhance spatial
generalization. Performance evaluations on four public datasets demonstrate
that TRG-Net achieves state-of-the-art results.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15126v1,,False
DeCaFlow: A Deconfounding Causal Generative Model,19/03/2025,"Alejandro Almodóvar, Adrián Javaloy, Juan Parras, Santiago Zazo, Isabel Valera","Causal generative models (CGMs) have recently emerged as capable approaches
to simulate the causal mechanisms generating our observations, enabling causal
inference. Unfortunately, existing approaches either are overly restrictive,
assuming the absence of hidden confounders, or lack generality, being tailored
to a particular query and graph. In this work, we introduce DeCaFlow, a CGM
that accounts for hidden confounders in a single amortized training process
using only observational data and the causal graph. Importantly, DeCaFlow can
provably identify all causal queries with a valid adjustment set or
sufficiently informative proxy variables. Remarkably, for the first time to our
knowledge, we show that a confounded counterfactual query is identifiable, and
thus solvable by DeCaFlow, as long as its interventional counterpart is as
well. Our empirical results on diverse settings (including the Ecoli70 dataset,
with 3 independent hidden confounders, tens of observed variables and hundreds
of causal queries) show that DeCaFlow outperforms existing approaches, while
demonstrating its out-of-the-box flexibility.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15114v1,,False
Diffusion-Based Forecasting for Uncertainty-Aware Model Predictive Control,19/03/2025,"Stelios Zarifis, Ioannis Kordonis, Petros Maragos","We propose Diffusion-Informed Model Predictive Control (D-I MPC), a generic
framework for uncertainty-aware prediction and decision-making in partially
observable stochastic systems by integrating diffusion-based time series
forecasting models in Model Predictive Control algorithms. In our approach, a
diffusion-based time series forecasting model is used to probabilistically
estimate the evolution of the system's stochastic components. These forecasts
are then incorporated into MPC algorithms to estimate future trajectories and
optimize action selection under the uncertainty of the future. We evaluate the
framework on the task of energy arbitrage, where a Battery Energy Storage
System participates in the day-ahead electricity market of the New York state.
Experimental results indicate that our model-based approach with a
diffusion-based forecaster significantly outperforms both implementations with
classical forecasting methods and model-free reinforcement learning baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15095v1,,False
StyleLoco: Generative Adversarial Distillation for Natural Humanoid Robot Locomotion,19/03/2025,"Le Ma, Ziyu Meng, Tengyu Liu, Yuhan Li, Ran Song, Wei Zhang, Siyuan Huang","Humanoid robots are anticipated to acquire a wide range of locomotion
capabilities while ensuring natural movement across varying speeds and
terrains. Existing methods encounter a fundamental dilemma in learning humanoid
locomotion: reinforcement learning with handcrafted rewards can achieve agile
locomotion but produces unnatural gaits, while Generative Adversarial Imitation
Learning (GAIL) with motion capture data yields natural movements but suffers
from unstable training processes and restricted agility. Integrating these
approaches proves challenging due to the inherent heterogeneity between expert
policies and human motion datasets. To address this, we introduce StyleLoco, a
novel two-stage framework that bridges this gap through a Generative
Adversarial Distillation (GAD) process. Our framework begins by training a
teacher policy using reinforcement learning to achieve agile and dynamic
locomotion. It then employs a multi-discriminator architecture, where distinct
discriminators concurrently extract skills from both the teacher policy and
motion capture data. This approach effectively combines the agility of
reinforcement learning with the natural fluidity of human-like movements while
mitigating the instability issues commonly associated with adversarial
training. Through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, we
demonstrate that StyleLoco enables humanoid robots to perform diverse
locomotion tasks with the precision of expertly trained policies and the
natural aesthetics of human motion, successfully transferring styles across
different movement types while maintaining stable locomotion across a broad
spectrum of command inputs.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15082v1,,False
HAD-Gen: Human-like and Diverse Driving Behavior Modeling for Controllable Scenario Generation,19/03/2025,"Cheng Wang, Lingxin Kong, Massimiliano Tamborski, Stefano V. Albrecht","Simulation-based testing has emerged as an essential tool for verifying and
validating autonomous vehicles (AVs). However, contemporary methodologies, such
as deterministic and imitation learning-based driver models, struggle to
capture the variability of human-like driving behavior. Given these challenges,
we propose HAD-Gen, a general framework for realistic traffic scenario
generation that simulates diverse human-like driving behaviors. The framework
first clusters the vehicle trajectory data into different driving styles
according to safety features. It then employs maximum entropy inverse
reinforcement learning on each of the clusters to learn the reward function
corresponding to each driving style. Using these reward functions, the method
integrates offline reinforcement learning pre-training and multi-agent
reinforcement learning algorithms to obtain general and robust driving
policies. Multi-perspective simulation results show that our proposed scenario
generation framework can simulate diverse, human-like driving behaviors with
strong generalization capability. The proposed framework achieves a 90.96%
goal-reaching rate, an off-road rate of 2.08%, and a collision rate of 6.91% in
the generalization test, outperforming prior approaches by over 20% in
goal-reaching performance. The source code is released at

Scalable Trajectory-User Linking with Dual-Stream Representation Networks,19/03/2025,"Hao Zhang, Wei Chen, Xingyu Zhao, Jianpeng Qi, Guiyuan Jiang, Yanwei Yu","Trajectory-user linking (TUL) aims to match anonymous trajectories to the
most likely users who generated them, offering benefits for a wide range of
real-world spatio-temporal applications. However, existing TUL methods are
limited by high model complexity and poor learning of the effective
representations of trajectories, rendering them ineffective in handling
large-scale user trajectory data. In this work, we propose a novel
$\underline{Scal}$abl$\underline{e}$ Trajectory-User Linking with dual-stream
representation networks for large-scale $\underline{TUL}$ problem, named
ScaleTUL. Specifically, ScaleTUL generates two views using temporal and spatial
augmentations to exploit supervised contrastive learning framework to
effectively capture the irregularities of trajectories. In each view, a
dual-stream trajectory encoder, consisting of a long-term encoder and a
short-term encoder, is designed to learn unified trajectory representations
that fuse different temporal-spatial dependencies. Then, a TUL layer is used to
associate the trajectories with the corresponding users in the representation
space using a two-stage training model. Experimental results on check-in
mobility datasets from three real-world cities and the nationwide U.S.
demonstrate the superiority of ScaleTUL over state-of-the-art baselines for
large-scale TUL tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15002v1,,False
Continual Multimodal Contrastive Learning,19/03/2025,"Xiaohao Liu, Xiaobo Xia, See-Kiong Ng, Tat-Seng Chua","Multimodal contrastive learning (MCL) advances in aligning different
modalities and generating multimodal representations in a joint space. By
leveraging contrastive learning across diverse modalities, large-scale
multimodal data enhances representational quality. However, a critical yet
often overlooked challenge remains: multimodal data is rarely collected in a
single process, and training from scratch is computationally expensive.
Instead, emergent multimodal data can be used to optimize existing models
gradually, \textit{i.e.}, models are trained on a sequence of modality pair
data. We define this problem as Continual Multimodal Contrastive Learning
(CMCL), an underexplored yet crucial research direction at the intersection of
multimodal and continual learning. In this paper, we formulate CMCL through two
specialized principles of stability and plasticity. We theoretically derive a
novel optimization-based method, which projects updated gradients from dual
sides onto subspaces where any gradient is prevented from interfering with the
previously learned knowledge. Two upper bounds provide theoretical insights on
both stability and plasticity in our solution. Beyond our theoretical
contributions, we conduct experiments on multiple datasets by comparing our
method against advanced continual learning baselines. The empirical results
further support our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of our method. The code
will be publicly available.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14963v1,,False
Semi-Gradient SARSA Routing with Theoretical Guarantee on Traffic Stability and Weight Convergence,19/03/2025,"Yidan Wu, Yu Yu, Jianan Zhang, Li Jin","We consider the traffic control problem of dynamic routing over parallel
servers, which arises in a variety of engineering systems such as
transportation and data transmission. We propose a semi-gradient, on-policy
algorithm that learns an approximate optimal routing policy. The algorithm uses
generic basis functions with flexible weights to approximate the value function
across the unbounded state space. Consequently, the training process lacks
Lipschitz continuity of the gradient, boundedness of the temporal-difference
error, and a prior guarantee on ergodicity, which are the standard
prerequisites in existing literature on reinforcement learning theory. To
address this, we combine a Lyapunov approach and an ordinary differential
equation-based method to jointly characterize the behavior of traffic state and
approximation weights. Our theoretical analysis proves that the training scheme
guarantees traffic state stability and ensures almost surely convergence of the
weights to the approximate optimum. We also demonstrate via simulations that
our algorithm attains significantly faster convergence than neural
network-based methods with an insignificant approximation error.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14927v1,,False
Evaluating Time Series Models with Knowledge Discovery,19/03/2025,Li Zhang,"Time series data is one of the most ubiquitous data modalities existing in a
diverse critical domains such as healthcare, seismology, manufacturing and
energy. Recent years, there are increasing interest of the data mining
community to develop time series deep learning models to pursue better
performance. The models performance often evaluate by certain evaluation
metrics such as RMSE, Accuracy, and F1-score. Yet time series data are often
hard to interpret and are collected with unknown environmental factors, sensor
configuration, latent physic mechanisms, and non-stationary evolving behavior.
As a result, a model that is better on standard metric-based evaluation may not
always perform better in real-world tasks. In this blue sky paper, we aim to
explore the challenge that exists in the metric-based evaluation framework for
time series data mining and propose a potential blue-sky idea -- developing a
knowledge-discovery-based evaluation framework, which aims to effectively
utilize domain-expertise knowledge to evaluate a model. We demonstrate that an
evidence-seeking explanation can potentially have stronger persuasive power
than metric-based evaluation and obtain better generalization ability for time
series data mining tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14869v1,,False
"Project Jenkins: Turning Monkey Neural Data into Robotic Arm Movement, and Back",19/03/2025,"Andrii Zahorodnii, Dima Yanovsky","Project Jenkins explores how neural activity in the brain can be decoded into
robotic movement and, conversely, how movement patterns can be used to generate
synthetic neural data. Using real neural data recorded from motor and premotor
cortex areas of a macaque monkey named Jenkins, we develop models for decoding
(converting brain signals into robotic arm movements) and encoding (simulating
brain activity corresponding to a given movement). For the interface between
the brain simulation and the physical world, we utilized Koch v1.1 leader and
follower robotic arms. We developed an interactive web console that allows
users to generate synthetic brain data from joystick movements in real time.
Our results are a step towards brain-controlled robotics, prosthetics, and
enhancing normal motor function. By accurately modeling brain activity, we take
a step toward flexible brain-computer interfaces that generalize beyond
predefined movements. To support the research community, we provide open source

Curiosity-Diffuser: Curiosity Guide Diffusion Models for Reliability,19/03/2025,"Zihao Liu, Xing Liu, Yizhai Zhang, Zhengxiong Liu, Panfeng Huang","One of the bottlenecks in robotic intelligence is the instability of neural
network models, which, unlike control models, lack a well-defined convergence
domain and stability. This leads to risks when applying intelligence in the
physical world. Specifically, imitation policy based on neural network may
generate hallucinations, leading to inaccurate behaviors that impact the safety
of real-world applications. To address this issue, this paper proposes the
Curiosity-Diffuser, aimed at guiding the conditional diffusion model to
generate trajectories with lower curiosity, thereby improving the reliability
of policy. The core idea is to use a Random Network Distillation (RND)
curiosity module to assess whether the model's behavior aligns with the
training data, and then minimize curiosity by classifier guidance diffusion to
reduce overgeneralization during inference. Additionally, we propose a
computationally efficient metric for evaluating the reliability of the policy,
measuring the similarity between the generated behaviors and the training
dataset, to facilitate research about reliability learning. Finally, simulation
verify the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed method to a variety
of scenarios, showing that Curiosity-Diffuser significantly improves task
performance and produces behaviors that are more similar to the training data.

The Hardness of Validating Observational Studies with Experimental Data,19/03/2025,"Jake Fawkes, Michael O'Riordan, Athanasios Vlontzos, Oriol Corcoll, Ciarán Mark Gilligan-Lee","Observational data is often readily available in large quantities, but can
lead to biased causal effect estimates due to the presence of unobserved
confounding. Recent works attempt to remove this bias by supplementing
observational data with experimental data, which, when available, is typically
on a smaller scale due to the time and cost involved in running a randomised
controlled trial. In this work, we prove a theorem that places fundamental
limits on this ``best of both worlds'' approach. Using the framework of
impossible inference, we show that although it is possible to use experimental
data to \emph{falsify} causal effect estimates from observational data, in
general it is not possible to \emph{validate} such estimates. Our theorem
proves that while experimental data can be used to detect bias in observational
studies, without additional assumptions on the smoothness of the correction
function, it can not be used to remove it. We provide a practical example of
such an assumption, developing a novel Gaussian Process based approach to
construct intervals which contain the true treatment effect with high
probability, both inside and outside of the support of the experimental data.
