FinZero: Launching Multi-modal Financial Time Series Forecast with Large Reasoning Model,10/09/2025,"Yanlong Wang, Jian Xu, Fei Ma, Hongkang Zhang, Hang Yu, Tiantian Gao, Yu Wang, Haochen You, Shao-Lun Huang, Danny Dongning Sun, Xiao-Ping Zhang","Financial time series forecasting is both highly significant and challenging.
Previous approaches typically standardized time series data before feeding it
into forecasting models, but this encoding process inherently leads to a loss
of important information. Moreover, past time series models generally require
fixed numbers of variables or lookback window lengths, which further limits the
scalability of time series forecasting. Besides, the interpretability and the
uncertainty in forecasting remain areas requiring further research, as these
factors directly impact the reliability and practical value of predictions. To
address these issues, we first construct a diverse financial image-text dataset
(FVLDB) and develop the Uncertainty-adjusted Group Relative Policy Optimization
(UARPO) method to enable the model not only output predictions but also analyze
the uncertainty of those predictions. We then proposed FinZero, a multimodal
pre-trained model finetuned by UARPO to perform reasoning, prediction, and
analytical understanding on the FVLDB financial time series. Extensive
experiments validate that FinZero exhibits strong adaptability and scalability.
After fine-tuning with UARPO, FinZero achieves an approximate 13.48\%
improvement in prediction accuracy over GPT-4o in the high-confidence group,
demonstrating the effectiveness of reinforcement learning fine-tuning in
multimodal large model, including in financial time series forecasting tasks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08742v1,,False
Data-driven generative simulation of SDEs using diffusion models,10/09/2025,"Xuefeng Gao, Jiale Zha, Xun Yu Zhou","This paper introduces a new approach to generating sample paths of unknown
stochastic differential equations (SDEs) using diffusion models, a class of
generative AI models commonly employed in image and video applications. Unlike
the traditional Monte Carlo methods for simulating SDEs, which require explicit
specifications of the drift and diffusion coefficients, our method takes a
model-free, data-driven approach. Given a finite set of sample paths from an
SDE, we utilize conditional diffusion models to generate new, synthetic paths
of the same SDE. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we conduct a
simulation experiment to compare our method with alternative benchmark ones
including neural SDEs. Furthermore, in an empirical study we leverage these
synthetically generated sample paths to enhance the performance of
reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous-time mean-variance portfolio
selection, hinting promising applications of diffusion models in financial
analysis and decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08731v1,,False
TANGO: Traversability-Aware Navigation with Local Metric Control for Topological Goals,10/09/2025,"Stefan Podgorski, Sourav Garg, Mehdi Hosseinzadeh, Lachlan Mares, Feras Dayoub, Ian Reid","Visual navigation in robotics traditionally relies on globally-consistent 3D
maps or learned controllers, which can be computationally expensive and
difficult to generalize across diverse environments. In this work, we present a
novel RGB-only, object-level topometric navigation pipeline that enables
zero-shot, long-horizon robot navigation without requiring 3D maps or
pre-trained controllers. Our approach integrates global topological path
planning with local metric trajectory control, allowing the robot to navigate
towards object-level sub-goals while avoiding obstacles. We address key
limitations of previous methods by continuously predicting local trajectory
using monocular depth and traversability estimation, and incorporating an
auto-switching mechanism that falls back to a baseline controller when
necessary. The system operates using foundational models, ensuring open-set
applicability without the need for domain-specific fine-tuning. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method in both simulated environments and real-world
tests, highlighting its robustness and deployability. Our approach outperforms
existing state-of-the-art methods, offering a more adaptable and effective
solution for visual navigation in open-set environments. The source code is
made publicly available: https://github.com/podgorki/TANGO.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08699v1,10.1109/ICRA55743.2025.11127998,False
Automatic Failure Attribution and Critical Step Prediction Method for Multi-Agent Systems Based on Causal Inference,10/09/2025,"Guoqing Ma, Jia Zhu, Hanghui Guo, Weijie Shi, Jiawei Shen, Jingjiang Liu, Yidan Liang","Multi-agent systems (MAS) are critical for automating complex tasks, yet
their practical deployment is severely hampered by the challenge of failure
attribution. Current diagnostic tools, which rely on statistical correlations,
are fundamentally inadequate; on challenging benchmarks like Who\&When,
state-of-the-art methods achieve less than 15\% accuracy in locating the
root-cause step of a failure. To address this critical gap, we introduce the
first failure attribution framework for MAS grounded in multi-granularity
causal inference. Our approach makes two key technical contributions: (1) a
performance causal inversion principle, which correctly models performance
dependencies by reversing the data flow in execution logs, combined with
Shapley values to accurately assign agent-level blame; (2) a novel causal
discovery algorithm, CDC-MAS, that robustly identifies critical failure steps
by tackling the non-stationary nature of MAS interaction data. The framework's
attribution results directly fuel an automated optimization loop, generating
targeted suggestions whose efficacy is validated via counterfactual
simulations. Evaluations on the Who\&When and TRAIL benchmarks demonstrate a
significant leap in performance. Our method achieves up to 36.2\% step-level
accuracy. Crucially, the generated optimizations boost overall task success
rates by an average of 22.4\%. This work provides a principled and effective
solution for debugging complex agent interactions, paving the way for more
reliable and interpretable multi-agent systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08682v1,,False
Signal Fidelity Index-Aware Calibration for Dementia Predictions Across Heterogeneous Real-World Data,10/09/2025,"Jingya Cheng, Jiazi Tian, Federica Spoto, Alaleh Azhir, Daniel Mork, Hossein Estiri","\textbf{Background:} Machine learning models trained on electronic health
records (EHRs) often degrade across healthcare systems due to distributional
shift. A fundamental but underexplored factor is diagnostic signal decay:
variability in diagnostic quality and consistency across institutions, which
affects the reliability of codes used for training and prediction.
  \textbf{Objective:} To develop a Signal Fidelity Index (SFI) quantifying
diagnostic data quality at the patient level in dementia, and to test SFI-aware
calibration for improving model performance across heterogeneous datasets
without outcome labels.
  \textbf{Methods:} We built a simulation framework generating 2,500 synthetic
datasets, each with 1,000 patients and realistic demographics, encounters, and
coding patterns based on dementia risk factors. The SFI was derived from six
interpretable components: diagnostic specificity, temporal consistency,
entropy, contextual concordance, medication alignment, and trajectory
stability. SFI-aware calibration applied a multiplicative adjustment, optimized
across 50 simulation batches.
  \textbf{Results:} At the optimal parameter ($\alpha$ = 2.0), SFI-aware
calibration significantly improved all metrics (p $<$ 0.001). Gains ranged from
10.3\% for Balanced Accuracy to 32.5\% for Recall, with notable increases in
Precision (31.9\%) and F1-score (26.1\%). Performance approached reference
standards, with F1-score and Recall within 1\% and Balanced Accuracy and
Detection Rate improved by 52.3\% and 41.1\%, respectively.
  \textbf{Conclusions:} Diagnostic signal decay is a tractable barrier to model
generalization. SFI-aware calibration provides a practical, label-free strategy
to enhance prediction across healthcare contexts, particularly for large-scale
administrative datasets lacking outcome labels.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08679v1,,False
Variational Rank Reduction Autoencoders for Generative,10/09/2025,"Alicia Tierz, Jad Mounayer, Beatriz Moya, Francisco Chinesta","Generative thermal design for complex geometries is fundamental in many areas
of engineering, yet it faces two main challenges: the high computational cost
of high-fidelity simulations and the limitations of conventional generative
models. Approaches such as autoencoders (AEs) and variational autoencoders
(VAEs) often produce unstructured latent spaces with discontinuities, which
restricts their capacity to explore designs and generate physically consistent
solutions.
  To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines
Variational Rank-Reduction Autoencoders (VRRAEs) with Deep Operator Networks
(DeepONets). The VRRAE introduces a truncated SVD within the latent space,
leading to continuous, interpretable, and well-structured representations that
mitigate posterior collapse and improve geometric reconstruction. The DeepONet
then exploits this compact latent encoding in its branch network, together with
spatial coordinates in the trunk network, to predict temperature gradients
efficiently and accurately.
  This hybrid approach not only enhances the quality of generated geometries
and the accuracy of gradient prediction, but also provides a substantial
advantage in inference efficiency compared to traditional numerical solvers.
Overall, the study underscores the importance of structured latent
representations for operator learning and highlights the potential of combining
generative models and operator networks in thermal design and broader
engineering applications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08515v1,,False
HumanAgencyBench: Scalable Evaluation of Human Agency Support in AI Assistants,10/09/2025,"Benjamin Sturgeon, Daniel Samuelson, Jacob Haimes, Jacy Reese Anthis","As humans delegate more tasks and decisions to artificial intelligence (AI),
we risk losing control of our individual and collective futures. Relatively
simple algorithmic systems already steer human decision-making, such as social
media feed algorithms that lead people to unintentionally and absent-mindedly
scroll through engagement-optimized content. In this paper, we develop the idea
of human agency by integrating philosophical and scientific theories of agency
with AI-assisted evaluation methods: using large language models (LLMs) to
simulate and validate user queries and to evaluate AI responses. We develop
HumanAgencyBench (HAB), a scalable and adaptive benchmark with six dimensions
of human agency based on typical AI use cases. HAB measures the tendency of an
AI assistant or agent to Ask Clarifying Questions, Avoid Value Manipulation,
Correct Misinformation, Defer Important Decisions, Encourage Learning, and
Maintain Social Boundaries. We find low-to-moderate agency support in
contemporary LLM-based assistants and substantial variation across system
developers and dimensions. For example, while Anthropic LLMs most support human
agency overall, they are the least supportive LLMs in terms of Avoid Value
Manipulation. Agency support does not appear to consistently result from
increasing LLM capabilities or instruction-following behavior (e.g., RLHF), and
we encourage a shift towards more robust safety and alignment targets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08494v1,,False
Efficient Decoding Methods for Language Models on Encrypted Data,10/09/2025,"Matan Avitan, Moran Baruch, Nir Drucker, Itamar Zimerman, Yoav Goldberg","Large language models (LLMs) power modern AI applications, but processing
sensitive data on untrusted servers raises privacy concerns. Homomorphic
encryption (HE) enables computation on encrypted data for secure inference.
However, neural text generation requires decoding methods like argmax and
sampling, which are non-polynomial and thus computationally expensive under
encryption, creating a significant performance bottleneck. We introduce cutmax,
an HE-friendly argmax algorithm that reduces ciphertext operations compared to
prior methods, enabling practical greedy decoding under encryption. We also
propose the first HE-compatible nucleus (top-p) sampling method, leveraging
cutmax for efficient stochastic decoding with provable privacy guarantees. Both
techniques are polynomial, supporting efficient inference in privacy-preserving
settings. Moreover, their differentiability facilitates gradient-based
sequence-level optimization as a polynomial alternative to straight-through
estimators. We further provide strong theoretical guarantees for cutmax,
proving it converges globally to a unique two-level fixed point, independent of
the input values beyond the identity of the maximizer, which explains its rapid
convergence in just a few iterations. Evaluations on realistic LLM outputs show
latency reductions of 24x-35x over baselines, advancing secure text generation.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08383v1,,False
Grasp Like Humans: Learning Generalizable Multi-Fingered Grasping from Human Proprioceptive Sensorimotor Integration,10/09/2025,"Ce Guo, Xieyuanli Chen, Zhiwen Zeng, Zirui Guo, Yihong Li, Haoran Xiao, Dewen Hu, Huimin Lu","Tactile and kinesthetic perceptions are crucial for human dexterous
manipulation, enabling reliable grasping of objects via proprioceptive
sensorimotor integration. For robotic hands, even though acquiring such tactile
and kinesthetic feedback is feasible, establishing a direct mapping from this
sensory feedback to motor actions remains challenging. In this paper, we
propose a novel glove-mediated tactile-kinematic perception-prediction
framework for grasp skill transfer from human intuitive and natural operation
to robotic execution based on imitation learning, and its effectiveness is
validated through generalized grasping tasks, including those involving
deformable objects. Firstly, we integrate a data glove to capture tactile and
kinesthetic data at the joint level. The glove is adaptable for both human and
robotic hands, allowing data collection from natural human hand demonstrations
across different scenarios. It ensures consistency in the raw data format,
enabling evaluation of grasping for both human and robotic hands. Secondly, we
establish a unified representation of multi-modal inputs based on graph
structures with polar coordinates. We explicitly integrate the morphological
differences into the designed representation, enhancing the compatibility
across different demonstrators and robotic hands. Furthermore, we introduce the
Tactile-Kinesthetic Spatio-Temporal Graph Networks (TK-STGN), which leverage
multidimensional subgraph convolutions and attention-based LSTM layers to
extract spatio-temporal features from graph inputs to predict node-based states
for each hand joint. These predictions are then mapped to final commands
through a force-position hybrid mapping.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08354v1,,False
Generative Quasi-Continuum Modeling of Confined Fluids at the Nanoscale,10/09/2025,"Bugra Yalcin, Ishan Nadkarni, Jinu Jeong, Chenxing Liang, Narayana R. Aluru","We present a data-efficient, multiscale framework for predicting the density
profiles of confined fluids at the nanoscale. While accurate density estimates
require prohibitively long timescales that are inaccessible by ab initio
molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, machine-learned molecular dynamics
(MLMD) offers a scalable alternative, enabling the generation of force
predictions at ab initio accuracy with reduced computational cost. However,
despite their efficiency, MLMD simulations remain constrained by femtosecond
timesteps, which limit their practicality for computing long-time averages
needed for accurate density estimation. To address this, we propose a
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) based
quasi-continuum approach that predicts the long-time behavior of force profiles
along the confinement direction, conditioned on noisy forces extracted from a
limited AIMD dataset. The predicted smooth forces are then linked to continuum
theory via the Nernst-Planck equation to reveal the underlying density
behavior. We test the framework on water confined between two graphene
nanoscale slits and demonstrate that density profiles for channel widths
outside of the training domain can be recovered with ab initio accuracy.
Compared to AIMD and MLMD simulations, our method achieves orders-of-magnitude
speed-up in runtime and requires significantly less training data than prior
works.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.08223v1,,False
