ScaffoldAvatar: High-Fidelity Gaussian Avatars with Patch Expressions,14/07/2025,"Shivangi Aneja, Sebastian Weiss, Irene Baeza, Prashanth Chandran, Gaspard Zoss, Matthias Nießner, Derek Bradley","Generating high-fidelity real-time animated sequences of photorealistic 3D
head avatars is important for many graphics applications, including immersive
telepresence and movies. This is a challenging problem particularly when
rendering digital avatar close-ups for showing character's facial microfeatures
and expressions. To capture the expressive, detailed nature of human heads,
including skin furrowing and finer-scale facial movements, we propose to couple
locally-defined facial expressions with 3D Gaussian splatting to enable
creating ultra-high fidelity, expressive and photorealistic 3D head avatars. In
contrast to previous works that operate on a global expression space, we
condition our avatar's dynamics on patch-based local expression features and
synthesize 3D Gaussians at a patch level. In particular, we leverage a
patch-based geometric 3D face model to extract patch expressions and learn how
to translate these into local dynamic skin appearance and motion by coupling
the patches with anchor points of Scaffold-GS, a recent hierarchical scene
representation. These anchors are then used to synthesize 3D Gaussians
on-the-fly, conditioned by patch-expressions and viewing direction. We employ
color-based densification and progressive training to obtain high-quality
results and faster convergence for high resolution 3K training images. By
leveraging patch-level expressions, ScaffoldAvatar consistently achieves
state-of-the-art performance with visually natural motion, while encompassing
diverse facial expressions and styles in real time.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10542v1,,False
Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS with Generative AI for Real-Time Driver Assistance,14/07/2025,"Kyungtae Han, Yitao Chen, Rohit Gupta, Onur Altintas","While autonomous driving technologies continue to advance, current Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) remain limited in their ability to interpret
scene context or engage with drivers through natural language. These systems
typically rely on predefined logic and lack support for dialogue-based
interaction, making them inflexible in dynamic environments or when adapting to
driver intent. This paper presents Scene-Aware Conversational ADAS (SC-ADAS), a
modular framework that integrates Generative AI components including large
language models, vision-to-text interpretation, and structured function calling
to enable real-time, interpretable, and adaptive driver assistance. SC-ADAS
supports multi-turn dialogue grounded in visual and sensor context, allowing
natural language recommendations and driver-confirmed ADAS control. Implemented
in the CARLA simulator with cloud-based Generative AI, the system executes
confirmed user intents as structured ADAS commands without requiring model
fine-tuning. We evaluate SC-ADAS across scene-aware, conversational, and
revisited multi-turn interactions, highlighting trade-offs such as increased
latency from vision-based context retrieval and token growth from accumulated
dialogue history. These results demonstrate the feasibility of combining
conversational reasoning, scene perception, and modular ADAS control to support
the next generation of intelligent driver assistance.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10500v1,,False
Cameras as Relative Positional Encoding,14/07/2025,"Ruilong Li, Brent Yi, Junchen Liu, Hang Gao, Yi Ma, Angjoo Kanazawa","Transformers are increasingly prevalent for multi-view computer vision tasks,
where geometric relationships between viewpoints are critical for 3D
perception. To leverage these relationships, multi-view transformers must use
camera geometry to ground visual tokens in 3D space. In this work, we compare
techniques for conditioning transformers on cameras: token-level raymap
encodings, attention-level relative pose encodings, and a new relative encoding
we propose -- Projective Positional Encoding (PRoPE) -- that captures complete
camera frustums, both intrinsics and extrinsics, as a relative positional
encoding. Our experiments begin by showing how relative camera conditioning
improves performance in feedforward novel view synthesis, with further gains
from PRoPE. This holds across settings: scenes with both shared and varying
intrinsics, when combining token- and attention-level conditioning, and for
generalization to inputs with out-of-distribution sequence lengths and camera
intrinsics. We then verify that these benefits persist for different tasks,
stereo depth estimation and discriminative spatial cognition, as well as larger
model sizes.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10496v1,,False
Some remarks on gradient dominance and LQR policy optimization,14/07/2025,Eduardo D. Sontag,"Solutions of optimization problems, including policy optimization in
reinforcement learning, typically rely upon some variant of gradient descent.
There has been much recent work in the machine learning, control, and
optimization communities applying the Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz Inequality (PLI) to
such problems in order to establish an exponential rate of convergence (a.k.a.
``linear convergence'' in the local-iteration language of numerical analysis)
of loss functions to their minima under the gradient flow. Often, as is the
case of policy iteration for the continuous-time LQR problem, this rate
vanishes for large initial conditions, resulting in a mixed globally linear /
locally exponential behavior. This is in sharp contrast with the discrete-time
LQR problem, where there is global exponential convergence. That gap between CT
and DT behaviors motivates the search for various generalized PLI-like
conditions, and this talk will address that topic. Moreover, these
generalizations are key to understanding the transient and asymptotic effects
of errors in the estimation of the gradient, errors which might arise from
adversarial attacks, wrong evaluation by an oracle, early stopping of a
simulation, inaccurate and very approximate digital twins, stochastic
computations (algorithm ``reproducibility''), or learning by sampling from
limited data. We describe an ``input to state stability'' (ISS) analysis of
this issue. The lecture also discussed convergence and PLI-like properties of
``linear feedforward neural networks'' in feedback control, but this arXiv
skips that part (to be updated). Much of the work described here was done in
collaboration with Arthur Castello B. de Oliveira, Leilei Cui, Zhong-Ping
Jiang, and Milad Siami.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10452v1,,False
Referential ambiguity and clarification requests: comparing human and LLM behaviour,14/07/2025,"Chris Madge, Matthew Purver, Massimo Poesio","In this work we examine LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions in
task-oriented dialogues that follow the asynchronous
instruction-giver/instruction-follower format. We present a new corpus that
combines two existing annotations of the Minecraft Dialogue Corpus -- one for
reference and ambiguity in reference, and one for SDRT including clarifications
-- into a single common format providing the necessary information to
experiment with clarifications and their relation to ambiguity. With this
corpus we compare LLM actions with original human-generated clarification
questions, examining how both humans and LLMs act in the case of ambiguity. We
find that there is only a weak link between ambiguity and humans producing
clarification questions in these dialogues, and low correlation between humans
and LLMs. Humans hardly ever produce clarification questions for referential
ambiguity, but often do so for task-based uncertainty. Conversely, LLMs produce
more clarification questions for referential ambiguity, but less so for task
uncertainty. We question if LLMs' ability to ask clarification questions is
predicated on their recent ability to simulate reasoning, and test this with
different reasoning approaches, finding that reasoning does appear to increase
question frequency and relevancy.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10445v1,,False
Extracting Important Tokens in E-Commerce Queries with a Tag Interaction-Aware Transformer Model,14/07/2025,"Md. Ahsanul Kabir, Mohammad Al Hasan, Aritra Mandal, Liyang Hao, Ishita Khan, Daniel Tunkelang, Zhe Wu","The major task of any e-commerce search engine is to retrieve the most
relevant inventory items, which best match the user intent reflected in a
query. This task is non-trivial due to many reasons, including ambiguous
queries, misaligned vocabulary between buyers, and sellers, over- or
under-constrained queries by the presence of too many or too few tokens. To
address these challenges, query reformulation is used, which modifies a user
query through token dropping, replacement or expansion, with the objective to
bridge semantic gap between query tokens and users' search intent. Early
methods of query reformulation mostly used statistical measures derived from
token co-occurrence frequencies from selective user sessions having clicks or
purchases. In recent years, supervised deep learning approaches, specifically
transformer-based neural language models, or sequence-to-sequence models are
being used for query reformulation task. However, these models do not utilize
the semantic tags of a query token, which are significant for capturing user
intent of an e-commerce query. In this work, we pose query reformulation as a
token classification task, and solve this task by designing a dependency-aware
transformer-based language model, TagBERT, which makes use of semantic tags of
a token for learning superior query phrase embedding. Experiments on large,
real-life e-commerce datasets show that TagBERT exhibits superior performance
than plethora of competing models, including BERT, eBERT, and
Sequence-to-Sequence transformer model for important token classification task.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10385v1,,False
MoCap-Impute: A Comprehensive Benchmark and Comparative Analysis of Imputation Methods for IMU-based Motion Capture Data,14/07/2025,"Mahmoud Bekhit, Ahmad Salah, Ahmed Salim Alrawahi, Tarek Attia, Ahmed Ali, Esraa Eldesokey, Ahmed Fathalla","Motion capture (MoCap) data from wearable Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)
is vital for applications in sports science, but its utility is often
compromised by missing data. Despite numerous imputation techniques, a
systematic performance evaluation for IMU-derived MoCap time-series data is
lacking. We address this gap by conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis
of statistical, machine learning, and deep learning imputation methods. Our
evaluation considers three distinct contexts: univariate time-series,
multivariate across subjects, and multivariate across kinematic angles. To
facilitate this benchmark, we introduce the first publicly available MoCap
dataset designed specifically for imputation, featuring data from 53 karate
practitioners. We simulate three controlled missingness mechanisms: missing
completely at random (MCAR), block missingness, and a novel value-dependent
pattern at signal transition points. Our experiments, conducted on 39 kinematic
variables across all subjects, reveal that multivariate imputation frameworks
consistently outperform univariate approaches, particularly for complex
missingness. For instance, multivariate methods achieve up to a 50% mean
absolute error reduction (MAE from 10.8 to 5.8) compared to univariate
techniques for transition point missingness. Advanced models like Generative
Adversarial Imputation Networks (GAIN) and Iterative Imputers demonstrate the
highest accuracy in these challenging scenarios. This work provides a critical
baseline for future research and offers practical recommendations for improving
the integrity and robustness of Mo-Cap data analysis.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10334v1,,False
Bridging Robustness and Generalization Against Word Substitution Attacks in NLP via the Growth Bound Matrix Approach,14/07/2025,"Mohammed Bouri, Adnane Saoud","Despite advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), models remain
vulnerable to adversarial attacks, such as synonym substitutions. While prior
work has focused on improving robustness for feed-forward and convolutional
architectures, the robustness of recurrent networks and modern state space
models (SSMs), such as S4, remains understudied. These architectures pose
unique challenges due to their sequential processing and complex parameter
dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a novel regularization technique based on
Growth Bound Matrices (GBM) to improve NLP model robustness by reducing the
impact of input perturbations on model outputs. We focus on computing the GBM
for three architectures: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), State Space models
(S4), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Our method aims to (1) enhance
resilience against word substitution attacks, (2) improve generalization on
clean text, and (3) providing the first systematic analysis of SSM (S4)
robustness. Extensive experiments across multiple architectures and benchmark
datasets demonstrate that our method improves adversarial robustness by up to
8.8% over existing baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness of our
approach, outperforming several state-of-the-art methods in adversarial
defense. Codes are available at https://github.com/BouriMohammed/GBM",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10330v1,,False
MF-GLaM: A multifidelity stochastic emulator using generalized lambda models,14/07/2025,"K. Giannoukou, X. Zhu, S. Marelli, B. Sudret","Stochastic simulators exhibit intrinsic stochasticity due to unobservable,
uncontrollable, or unmodeled input variables, resulting in random outputs even
at fixed input conditions. Such simulators are common across various scientific
disciplines; however, emulating their entire conditional probability
distribution is challenging, as it is a task traditional deterministic
surrogate modeling techniques are not designed for. Additionally, accurately
characterizing the response distribution can require prohibitively large
datasets, especially for computationally expensive high-fidelity (HF)
simulators. When lower-fidelity (LF) stochastic simulators are available, they
can enhance limited HF information within a multifidelity surrogate modeling
(MFSM) framework. While MFSM techniques are well-established for deterministic
settings, constructing multifidelity emulators to predict the full conditional
response distribution of stochastic simulators remains a challenge. In this
paper, we propose multifidelity generalized lambda models (MF-GLaMs) to
efficiently emulate the conditional response distribution of HF stochastic
simulators by exploiting data from LF stochastic simulators. Our approach
builds upon the generalized lambda model (GLaM), which represents the
conditional distribution at each input by a flexible, four-parameter
generalized lambda distribution. MF-GLaMs are non-intrusive, requiring no
access to the internal stochasticity of the simulators nor multiple
replications of the same input values. We demonstrate the efficacy of MF-GLaM
through synthetic examples of increasing complexity and a realistic earthquake
application. Results show that MF-GLaMs can achieve improved accuracy at the
same cost as single-fidelity GLaMs, or comparable performance at significantly
reduced cost.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10303v1,,False
Conditional Chemical Language Models are Versatile Tools in Drug Discovery,14/07/2025,"Lu Zhu, Emmanuel Noutahi","Generative chemical language models (CLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in molecular design, yet their impact in drug discovery remains
limited by the absence of reliable reward signals and the lack of
interpretability in their outputs. We present SAFE-T, a generalist chemical
modeling framework that conditions on biological context -- such as protein
targets or mechanisms of action -- to prioritize and design molecules without
relying on structural information or engineered scoring functions. SAFE-T
models the conditional likelihood of fragment-based molecular sequences given a
biological prompt, enabling principled scoring of molecules across tasks such
as virtual screening, drug-target interaction prediction, and activity cliff
detection. Moreover, it supports goal-directed generation by sampling from this
learned distribution, aligning molecular design with biological objectives. In
comprehensive zero-shot evaluations across predictive (LIT-PCBA, DAVIS, KIBA,
ACNet) and generative (DRUG, PMO) benchmarks, SAFE-T consistently achieves
performance comparable to or better than existing approaches while being
significantly faster. Fragment-level attribution further reveals that SAFE-T
captures known structure-activity relationships, supporting interpretable and
biologically grounded design. Together with its computational efficiency, these
results demonstrate that conditional generative CLMs can unify scoring and
generation to accelerate early-stage drug discovery.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10273v1,,False
Pimba: A Processing-in-Memory Acceleration for Post-Transformer Large Language Model Serving,14/07/2025,"Wonung Kim, Yubin Lee, Yoonsung Kim, Jinwoo Hwang, Seongryong Oh, Jiyong Jung, Aziz Huseynov, Woong Gyu Park, Chang Hyun Park, Divya Mahajan, Jongse Park","Transformers are the driving force behind today's Large Language Models
(LLMs), serving as the foundation for their performance and versatility. Yet,
their compute and memory costs grow with sequence length, posing scalability
challenges for long-context inferencing. In response, the algorithm community
is exploring alternative architectures, such as state space models (SSMs),
linear attention, and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), which we refer to as
post-transformers. This shift presents a key challenge: building a serving
system that efficiently supports both transformer and post-transformer LLMs
within a unified framework. To address this challenge, we analyze the
performance characteristics of transformer and post-transformer LLMs. Despite
their algorithmic differences, both are fundamentally limited by memory
bandwidth under batched inference due to attention in transformers and state
updates in post-transformers. Further analyses suggest two additional insights:
(1) state update operations, unlike attention, incur high hardware cost, making
per-bank PIM acceleration inefficient, and (2) different low-precision
arithmetic methods offer varying accuracy-area tradeoffs, while we identify
Microsoft's MX as the Pareto-optimal choice. Building on these insights, we
design Pimba as an array of State-update Processing Units (SPUs), each shared
between two banks to enable interleaved access to PIM. Each SPU includes a
State-update Processing Engine (SPE) that comprises element-wise multipliers
and adders using MX-based quantized arithmetic, enabling efficient execution of
state update and attention operations. Our evaluation shows that, compared to
LLM-optimized GPU and GPU+PIM systems, Pimba achieves up to 3.2x and 2.1x
higher token generation throughput, respectively.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10178v1,,False
Should We Ever Prefer Decision Transformer for Offline Reinforcement Learning?,14/07/2025,"Yumi Omori, Zixuan Dong, Keith Ross","In recent years, extensive work has explored the application of the
Transformer architecture to reinforcement learning problems. Among these,
Decision Transformer (DT) has gained particular attention in the context of
offline reinforcement learning due to its ability to frame return-conditioned
policy learning as a sequence modeling task. Most recently, Bhargava et al.
(2024) provided a systematic comparison of DT with more conventional MLP-based
offline RL algorithms, including Behavior Cloning (BC) and Conservative
Q-Learning (CQL), and claimed that DT exhibits superior performance in
sparse-reward and low-quality data settings.
  In this paper, through experimentation on robotic manipulation tasks
(Robomimic) and locomotion benchmarks (D4RL), we show that MLP-based Filtered
Behavior Cloning (FBC) achieves competitive or superior performance compared to
DT in sparse-reward environments. FBC simply filters out low-performing
trajectories from the dataset and then performs ordinary behavior cloning on
the filtered dataset. FBC is not only very straightforward, but it also
requires less training data and is computationally more efficient. The results
therefore suggest that DT is not preferable for sparse-reward environments.
From prior work, arguably, DT is also not preferable for dense-reward
environments. Thus, we pose the question: Is DT ever preferable?",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10174v1,,False
Simulating Biases for Interpretable Fairness in Offline and Online Classifiers,14/07/2025,"Ricardo Inácio, Zafeiris Kokkinogenis, Vitor Cerqueira, Carlos Soares","Predictive models often reinforce biases which were originally embedded in
their training data, through skewed decisions. In such cases, mitigation
methods are critical to ensure that, regardless of the prevailing disparities,
model outcomes are adjusted to be fair. To assess this, datasets could be
systematically generated with specific biases, to train machine learning
classifiers. Then, predictive outcomes could aid in the understanding of this
bias embedding process. Hence, an agent-based model (ABM), depicting a loan
application process that represents various systemic biases across two
demographic groups, was developed to produce synthetic datasets. Then, by
applying classifiers trained on them to predict loan outcomes, we can assess
how biased data leads to unfairness. This highlights a main contribution of
this work: a framework for synthetic dataset generation with controllable bias
injection. We also contribute with a novel explainability technique, which
shows how mitigations affect the way classifiers leverage data features, via
second-order Shapley values. In experiments, both offline and online learning
approaches are employed. Mitigations are applied at different stages of the
modelling pipeline, such as during pre-processing and in-processing.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10154v1,,False
FRSICL: LLM-Enabled In-Context Learning Flight Resource Allocation for Fresh Data Collection in UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring,14/07/2025,"Yousef Emami, Hao Zhou, Miguel Gutierrez Gaitan, Kai Li, Luis Almeida","Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are vital for public safety, particularly in
wildfire monitoring, where early detection minimizes environmental impact. In
UAV-Assisted Wildfire Monitoring (UAWM) systems, joint optimization of sensor
transmission scheduling and velocity is critical for minimizing Age of
Information (AoI) from stale sensor data. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has
been used for such optimization; however, its limitations such as low sampling
efficiency, simulation-to-reality gaps, and complex training render it
unsuitable for time-critical applications like wildfire monitoring. This paper
introduces a new online Flight Resource Allocation scheme based on LLM-Enabled
In-Context Learning (FRSICL) to jointly optimize the UAV's flight control and
data collection schedule along the trajectory in real time, thereby
asymptotically minimizing the average AoI across ground sensors. In contrast to
DRL, FRSICL generates data collection schedules and controls velocity using
natural language task descriptions and feedback from the environment, enabling
dynamic decision-making without extensive retraining. Simulation results
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed FRSICL compared to Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) and Nearest-Neighbor baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.10134v1,,False
Improving monotonic optimization in heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning with optimal marginal deterministic policy gradient,14/07/2025,"Xiaoyang Yu, Youfang Lin, Shuo Wang, Sheng Han","In heterogeneous multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), achieving
monotonic improvement plays a pivotal role in enhancing performance. The HAPPO
algorithm proposes a feasible solution by introducing a sequential update
scheme, which requires independent learning with No Parameter-sharing (NoPS).
However, heterogeneous MARL generally requires Partial Parameter-sharing
(ParPS) based on agent grouping to achieve high cooperative performance. Our
experiments prove that directly combining ParPS with the sequential update
scheme leads to the policy updating baseline drift problem, thereby failing to
achieve improvement. To solve the conflict between monotonic improvement and
ParPS, we propose the Optimal Marginal Deterministic Policy Gradient (OMDPG)
algorithm. First, we replace the sequentially computed $Q_{\psi}^s(s,a_{1:i})$
with the Optimal Marginal Q (OMQ) function $\phi_{\psi}^*(s,a_{1:i})$ derived
from Q-functions. This maintains MAAD's monotonic improvement while eliminating
the conflict through optimal joint action sequences instead of sequential
policy ratio calculations. Second, we introduce the Generalized Q Critic (GQC)
as the critic function, employing pessimistic uncertainty-constrained loss to
optimize different Q-value estimations. This provides the required Q-values for
OMQ computation and stable baselines for actor updates. Finally, we implement a
Centralized Critic Grouped Actor (CCGA) architecture that simultaneously
achieves ParPS in local policy networks and accurate global Q-function
computation. Experimental results in SMAC and MAMuJoCo environments demonstrate
that OMDPG outperforms various state-of-the-art MARL baselines.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09989v1,,False
Text-Driven Causal Representation Learning for Source-Free Domain Generalization,14/07/2025,"Lihua Zhou, Mao Ye, Nianxin Li, Shuaifeng Li, Jinlin Wu, Xiatian Zhu, Lei Deng, Hongbin Liu, Jiebo Luo, Zhen Lei","Deep learning often struggles when training and test data distributions
differ. Traditional domain generalization (DG) tackles this by including data
from multiple source domains, which is impractical due to expensive data
collection and annotation. Recent vision-language models like CLIP enable
source-free domain generalization (SFDG) by using text prompts to simulate
visual representations, reducing data demands. However, existing SFDG methods
struggle with domain-specific confounders, limiting their generalization
capabilities. To address this issue, we propose TDCRL
(\textbf{T}ext-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{C}ausal \textbf{R}epresentation
\textbf{L}earning), the first method to integrate causal inference into the
SFDG setting. TDCRL operates in two steps: first, it employs data augmentation
to generate style word vectors, combining them with class information to
generate text embeddings to simulate visual representations; second, it trains
a causal intervention network with a confounder dictionary to extract
domain-invariant features. Grounded in causal learning, our approach offers a
clear and effective mechanism to achieve robust, domain-invariant features,
ensuring robust generalization. Extensive experiments on PACS, VLCS,
OfficeHome, and DomainNet show state-of-the-art performance, proving TDCRL
effectiveness in SFDG.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09961v1,,False
Radial Neighborhood Smoothing Recommender System,14/07/2025,"Zerui Zhang, Yumou Qiu","Recommender systems inherently exhibit a low-rank structure in latent space.
A key challenge is to define meaningful and measurable distances in the latent
space to capture user-user, item-item, user-item relationships effectively. In
this work, we establish that distances in the latent space can be
systematically approximated using row-wise and column-wise distances in the
observed matrix, providing a novel perspective on distance estimation. To
refine the distance estimation, we introduce the correction based on empirical
variance estimator to account for noise-induced non-centrality. The novel
distance estimation enables a more structured approach to constructing
neighborhoods, leading to the Radial Neighborhood Estimator (RNE), which
constructs neighborhoods by including both overlapped and partially overlapped
user-item pairs and employs neighborhood smoothing via localized kernel
regression to improve imputation accuracy. We provide the theoretical
asymptotic analysis for the proposed estimator. We perform evaluations on both
simulated and real-world datasets, demonstrating that RNE achieves superior
performance compared to existing collaborative filtering and matrix
factorization methods. While our primary focus is on distance estimation in
latent space, we find that RNE also mitigates the ``cold-start'' problem.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09952v1,,False
Memorization Sinks: Isolating Memorization during LLM Training,14/07/2025,"Gaurav R. Ghosal, Pratyush Maini, Aditi Raghunathan","Large language models are susceptible to memorizing repeated sequences,
posing privacy and copyright concerns. A popular mitigation strategy is to
remove memorized information from specific neurons post-hoc. However, such
approaches have shown limited success so far. In a controlled setting, we show
that the memorization of natural sequences (those that resemble linguistically
plausible text) become mechanistically entangled with general language
abilities, thereby becoming challenging to remove post-hoc. In this work, we
put forward a new paradigm of MemSinks that promotes isolation of memorization
by design. We leverage a sequence identifier that activates a unique set of
memorization neurons for each sequence across repetitions. By analyzing the
dynamics of learning and forgetting, we argue that MemSinks facilitates
isolation of memorized content, making it easier to remove without compromising
general language capabilities. We implement MemSinks at the billion-parameter
and billion-token scale, and observe both effective isolation and strong
generalization. To our knowledge, this is the first proof-of-concept on real
data demonstrating that simultaneous generalization and isolation is
achievable. We open-source our code at http://github.com/grghosal/MemSinks.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09937v1,,False
Solving dynamic portfolio selection problems via score-based diffusion models,14/07/2025,"Ahmad Aghapour, Erhan Bayraktar, Fengyi Yuan","In this paper, we tackle the dynamic mean-variance portfolio selection
problem in a {\it model-free} manner, based on (generative) diffusion models.
We propose using data sampled from the real model $\mathcal P$ (which is
unknown) with limited size to train a generative model $\mathcal Q$ (from which
we can easily and adequately sample). With adaptive training and sampling
methods that are tailor-made for time series data, we obtain quantification
bounds between $\mathcal P$ and $\mathcal Q$ in terms of the adapted
Wasserstein metric $\mathcal A W_2$. Importantly, the proposed adapted sampling
method also facilitates {\it conditional sampling}. In the second part of this
paper, we provide the stability of the mean-variance portfolio optimization
problems in $\mathcal A W _2$. Then, combined with the error bounds and the
stability result, we propose a policy gradient algorithm based on the
generative environment, in which our innovative adapted sampling method
provides approximate scenario generators. We illustrate the performance of our
algorithm on both simulated and real data. For real data, the algorithm based
on the generative environment produces portfolios that beat several important

Algorithm Development in Neural Networks: Insights from the Streaming Parity Task,14/07/2025,"Loek van Rossem, Andrew M. Saxe","Even when massively overparameterized, deep neural networks show a remarkable
ability to generalize. Research on this phenomenon has focused on
generalization within distribution, via smooth interpolation. Yet in some
settings neural networks also learn to extrapolate to data far beyond the
bounds of the original training set, sometimes even allowing for infinite
generalization, implying that an algorithm capable of solving the task has been
learned. Here we undertake a case study of the learning dynamics of recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) trained on the streaming parity task in order to develop
an effective theory of algorithm development. The streaming parity task is a
simple but nonlinear task defined on sequences up to arbitrary length. We show
that, with sufficient finite training experience, RNNs exhibit a phase
transition to perfect infinite generalization. Using an effective theory for
the representational dynamics, we find an implicit representational merger
effect which can be interpreted as the construction of a finite automaton that
reproduces the task. Overall, our results disclose one mechanism by which
neural networks can generalize infinitely from finite training experience.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09897v1,,False
Sequence-Model-Guided Measurement Selection for Quantum State Learning,14/07/2025,"Jiaxin Huang, Yan Zhu, Giulio Chiribella, Ya-Dong Wu","Characterization of quantum systems from experimental data is a central
problem in quantum science and technology. But which measurements should be
used to gather data in the first place? While optimal measurement choices can
be worked out for small quantum systems, the optimization becomes intractable
as the system size grows large. To address this problem, we introduce a deep
neural network with a sequence model architecture that searches for efficient
measurement choices in a data-driven, adaptive manner. The model can be applied
to a variety of tasks, including the prediction of linear and nonlinear
properties of quantum states, as well as state clustering and state tomography
tasks. In all these tasks, we find that the measurement choices identified by
our neural network consistently outperform the uniformly random choice.
Intriguingly, for topological quantum systems, our model tends to recommend
measurements at the system's boundaries, even when the task is to predict bulk
properties. This behavior suggests that the neural network may have
independently discovered a connection between boundaries and bulk, without
having been provided any built-in knowledge of quantum physics.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.09891v1,,False
