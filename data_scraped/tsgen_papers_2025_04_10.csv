Neural Motion Simulator: Pushing the Limit of World Models in Reinforcement Learning,09/04/2025,"Chenjie Hao, Weyl Lu, Yifan Xu, Yubei Chen","An embodied system must not only model the patterns of the external world but
also understand its own motion dynamics. A motion dynamic model is essential
for efficient skill acquisition and effective planning. In this work, we
introduce the neural motion simulator (MoSim), a world model that predicts the
future physical state of an embodied system based on current observations and
actions. MoSim achieves state-of-the-art performance in physical state
prediction and provides competitive performance across a range of downstream
tasks. This works shows that when a world model is accurate enough and performs
precise long-horizon predictions, it can facilitate efficient skill acquisition
in imagined worlds and even enable zero-shot reinforcement learning.
Furthermore, MoSim can transform any model-free reinforcement learning (RL)
algorithm into a model-based approach, effectively decoupling physical
environment modeling from RL algorithm development. This separation allows for
independent advancements in RL algorithms and world modeling, significantly
improving sample efficiency and enhancing generalization capabilities. Our
findings highlight that world models for motion dynamics is a promising
direction for developing more versatile and capable embodied systems.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.07095v1,,False
MedSegFactory: Text-Guided Generation of Medical Image-Mask Pairs,09/04/2025,"Jiawei Mao, Yuhan Wang, Yucheng Tang, Daguang Xu, Kang Wang, Yang Yang, Zongwei Zhou, Yuyin Zhou","This paper presents MedSegFactory, a versatile medical synthesis framework
that generates high-quality paired medical images and segmentation masks across
modalities and tasks. It aims to serve as an unlimited data repository,
supplying image-mask pairs to enhance existing segmentation tools. The core of
MedSegFactory is a dual-stream diffusion model, where one stream synthesizes
medical images and the other generates corresponding segmentation masks. To
ensure precise alignment between image-mask pairs, we introduce Joint
Cross-Attention (JCA), enabling a collaborative denoising paradigm by dynamic
cross-conditioning between streams. This bidirectional interaction allows both
representations to guide each other's generation, enhancing consistency between
generated pairs. MedSegFactory unlocks on-demand generation of paired medical
images and segmentation masks through user-defined prompts that specify the
target labels, imaging modalities, anatomical regions, and pathological
conditions, facilitating scalable and high-quality data generation. This new
paradigm of medical image synthesis enables seamless integration into diverse
medical imaging workflows, enhancing both efficiency and accuracy. Extensive
experiments show that MedSegFactory generates data of superior quality and
usability, achieving competitive or state-of-the-art performance in 2D and 3D
segmentation tasks while addressing data scarcity and regulatory constraints.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06897v1,,False
FamilyTool: A Multi-hop Personalized Tool Use Benchmark,09/04/2025,"Yuxin Wang, Yiran Guo, Yining Zheng, Zhangyue Yin, Shuo Chen, Jie Yang, Jiajun Chen, Xuanjing Huang, Xipeng Qiu","The integration of tool learning with Large Language Models (LLMs) has
expanded their capabilities in handling complex tasks by leveraging external
tools. However, existing benchmarks for tool learning inadequately address
critical real-world personalized scenarios, particularly those requiring
multi-hop reasoning and inductive knowledge adaptation in dynamic environments.
To bridge this gap, we introduce FamilyTool, a novel benchmark grounded in a
family-based knowledge graph (KG) that simulates personalized, multi-hop tool
use scenarios. FamilyTool challenges LLMs with queries spanning 1 to 3
relational hops (e.g., inferring familial connections and preferences) and
incorporates an inductive KG setting where models must adapt to unseen user
preferences and relationships without re-training, a common limitation in prior
approaches that compromises generalization. We further propose KGETool: a
simple KG-augmented evaluation pipeline to systematically assess LLMs' tool use
ability in these settings. Experiments reveal significant performance gaps in
state-of-the-art LLMs, with accuracy dropping sharply as hop complexity
increases and inductive scenarios exposing severe generalization deficits.
These findings underscore the limitations of current LLMs in handling
personalized, evolving real-world contexts and highlight the urgent need for
advancements in tool-learning frameworks. FamilyTool serves as a critical
resource for evaluating and advancing LLM agents' reasoning, adaptability, and
scalability in complex, dynamic environments. Code and dataset are available at
Github.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06766v1,,False
Plastic tensor networks for interpretable generative modeling,09/04/2025,"Katsuya O. Akamatsu, Kenji Harada, Tsuyoshi Okubo, Naoki Kawashima","A structural optimization scheme for a single-layer nonnegative adaptive
tensor tree (NATT) that models a target probability distribution is proposed.
The NATT scheme, by construction, has the advantage that it is interpretable as
a probabilistic graphical model. We consider the NATT scheme and a recently
proposed Born machine adaptive tensor tree (BMATT) optimization scheme and
demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of generative modeling tasks where
the objective is to infer the hidden structure of a provided dataset. Our
results show that in terms of minimizing the negative log-likelihood, the
single-layer scheme has model performance comparable to the Born machine
scheme, though not better. The tasks include deducing the structure of binary
bitwise operations, learning the internal structure of random Bayesian networks
given only visible sites, and a real-world example related to hierarchical
clustering where a cladogram is constructed from mitochondrial DNA sequences.
In doing so, we also show the importance of the choice of network topology and
the versatility of a least-mutual information criterion in selecting a
candidate structure for a tensor tree, as well as discuss aspects of these
tensor tree generative models including their information content and
interpretability.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06722v1,,False
CAT: Circular-Convolutional Attention for Sub-Quadratic Transformers,09/04/2025,Yoshihiro Yamada,"Transformers have driven remarkable breakthroughs in natural language
processing and computer vision, yet their standard attention mechanism still
imposes O(N^2) complexity, hindering scalability to longer sequences. We
introduce Circular-convolutional ATtention (CAT), a Fourier-based approach that
efficiently applies circular convolutions to reduce complexity without
sacrificing representational power. CAT achieves O(NlogN) computations,
requires fewer learnable parameters by streamlining fully-connected layers, and
introduces no heavier operations, resulting in consistent accuracy improvements
and about a 10% speedup in naive PyTorch implementations on large-scale
benchmarks such as ImageNet-1k and WikiText-103. Grounded in an
engineering-isomorphism framework, CAT's design not only offers practical
efficiency and ease of implementation but also provides insights to guide the
development of next-generation, high-performance Transformer architectures.
Finally, our ablation studies highlight the key conditions underlying CAT's
success, shedding light on broader principles for scalable attention
mechanisms.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06704v1,,False
Benchmarking Convolutional Neural Network and Graph Neural Network based Surrogate Models on a Real-World Car External Aerodynamics Dataset,09/04/2025,"Sam Jacob Jacob, Markus Mrosek, Carsten Othmer, Harald KÃ¶stler","Aerodynamic optimization is crucial for developing eco-friendly, aerodynamic,
and stylish cars, which requires close collaboration between aerodynamicists
and stylists, a collaboration impaired by the time-consuming nature of
aerodynamic simulations. Surrogate models offer a viable solution to reduce
this overhead, but they are untested in real-world aerodynamic datasets. We
present a comparative evaluation of two surrogate modeling approaches for
predicting drag on a real-world dataset: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
model that uses a signed distance field as input and a commercial tool based on
Graph Neural Networks (GNN) that directly processes a surface mesh. In contrast
to previous studies based on datasets created from parameterized geometries,
our dataset comprises 343 geometries derived from 32 baseline vehicle
geometries across five distinct car projects, reflecting the diverse, free-form
modifications encountered in the typical vehicle development process. Our
results show that the CNN-based method achieves a mean absolute error of 2.3
drag counts, while the GNN-based method achieves 3.8. Both methods achieve
approximately 77% accuracy in predicting the direction of drag change relative
to the baseline geometry. While both methods effectively capture the broader
trends between baseline groups (set of samples derived from a single baseline
geometry), they struggle to varying extents in capturing the finer
intra-baseline group variations. In summary, our findings suggest that
aerodynamicists can effectively use both methods to predict drag in under two
minutes, which is at least 600 times faster than performing a simulation.
However, there remains room for improvement in capturing the finer details of
the geometry.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06699v1,,False
AMAD: AutoMasked Attention for Unsupervised Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detection,09/04/2025,"Tiange Huang, Yongjun Li","Unsupervised multivariate time series anomaly detection (UMTSAD) plays a
critical role in various domains, including finance, networks, and sensor
systems. In recent years, due to the outstanding performance of deep learning
in general sequential tasks, many models have been specialized for deep UMTSAD
tasks and have achieved impressive results, particularly those based on the
Transformer and self-attention mechanisms. However, the sequence anomaly
association assumptions underlying these models are often limited to specific
predefined patterns and scenarios, such as concentrated or peak anomaly
patterns. These limitations hinder their ability to generalize to diverse
anomaly situations, especially where the lack of labels poses significant
challenges. To address these issues, we propose AMAD, which integrates
\textbf{A}uto\textbf{M}asked Attention for UMTS\textbf{AD} scenarios. AMAD
introduces a novel structure based on the AutoMask mechanism and an attention
mixup module, forming a simple yet generalized anomaly association
representation framework. This framework is further enhanced by a Max-Min
training strategy and a Local-Global contrastive learning approach. By
combining multi-scale feature extraction with automatic relative association
modeling, AMAD provides a robust and adaptable solution to UMTSAD challenges.
Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model achieving
competitive performance results compared to SOTA benchmarks across a variety of
datasets.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06643v1,,False
InteractRank: Personalized Web-Scale Search Pre-Ranking with Cross Interaction Features,09/04/2025,"Sujay Khandagale, Bhawna Juneja, Prabhat Agarwal, Aditya Subramanian, Jaewon Yang, Yuting Wang","Modern search systems use a multi-stage architecture to deliver personalized
results efficiently. Key stages include retrieval, pre-ranking, full ranking,
and blending, which refine billions of items to top selections. The pre-ranking
stage, vital for scoring and filtering hundreds of thousands of items down to a
few thousand, typically relies on two tower models due to their computational
efficiency, despite often lacking in capturing complex interactions. While
query-item cross interaction features are paramount for full ranking,
integrating them into pre-ranking models presents efficiency-related
challenges. In this paper, we introduce InteractRank, a novel two tower
pre-ranking model with robust cross interaction features used at Pinterest. By
incorporating historical user engagement-based query-item interactions in the
scoring function along with the two tower dot product, InteractRank
significantly boosts pre-ranking performance with minimal latency and
computation costs. In real-world A/B experiments at Pinterest, InteractRank
improves the online engagement metric by 6.5% over a BM25 baseline and by 3.7%
over a vanilla two tower baseline. We also highlight other components of
InteractRank, like real-time user-sequence modeling, and analyze their
contributions through offline ablation studies. The code for InteractRank is
available at https://github.com/pinterest/atg-research/tree/main/InteractRank.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06609v1,10.1145/3701716.3715239,False
CAFE-AD: Cross-Scenario Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving,09/04/2025,"Junrui Zhang, Chenjie Wang, Jie Peng, Haoyu Li, Jianmin Ji, Yu Zhang, Yanyong Zhang","Imitation learning based planning tasks on the nuPlan dataset have gained
great interest due to their potential to generate human-like driving behaviors.
However, open-loop training on the nuPlan dataset tends to cause causal
confusion during closed-loop testing, and the dataset also presents a long-tail
distribution of scenarios. These issues introduce challenges for imitation
learning. To tackle these problems, we introduce CAFE-AD, a Cross-Scenario
Adaptive Feature Enhancement for Trajectory Planning in Autonomous Driving
method, designed to enhance feature representation across various scenario
types. We develop an adaptive feature pruning module that ranks feature
importance to capture the most relevant information while reducing the
interference of noisy information during training. Moreover, we propose a
cross-scenario feature interpolation module that enhances scenario information
to introduce diversity, enabling the network to alleviate over-fitting in
dominant scenarios. We evaluate our method CAFE-AD on the challenging public
nuPlan Test14-Hard closed-loop simulation benchmark. The results demonstrate
that CAFE-AD outperforms state-of-the-art methods including rule-based and
hybrid planners, and exhibits the potential in mitigating the impact of
long-tail distribution within the dataset. Additionally, we further validate
its effectiveness in real-world environments. The code and models will be made
available at https://github.com/AlniyatRui/CAFE-AD.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06584v1,,False
Exploring Ordinal Bias in Action Recognition for Instructional Videos,09/04/2025,"Joochan Kim, Minjoon Jung, Byoung-Tak Zhang","Action recognition models have achieved promising results in understanding
instructional videos. However, they often rely on dominant, dataset-specific
action sequences rather than true video comprehension, a problem that we define
as ordinal bias. To address this issue, we propose two effective video
manipulation methods: Action Masking, which masks frames of frequently
co-occurring actions, and Sequence Shuffling, which randomizes the order of
action segments. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that current
models exhibit significant performance drops when confronted with nonstandard
action sequences, underscoring their vulnerability to ordinal bias. Our
findings emphasize the importance of rethinking evaluation strategies and
developing models capable of generalizing beyond fixed action patterns in
diverse instructional videos.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06580v1,,False
Diffusion Factor Models: Generating High-Dimensional Returns with Factor Structure,09/04/2025,"Minshuo Chen, Renyuan Xu, Yumin Xu, Ruixun Zhang","Financial scenario simulation is essential for risk management and portfolio
optimization, yet it remains challenging especially in high-dimensional and
small data settings common in finance. We propose a diffusion factor model that
integrates latent factor structure into generative diffusion processes,
bridging econometrics with modern generative AI to address the challenges of
the curse of dimensionality and data scarcity in financial simulation. By
exploiting the low-dimensional factor structure inherent in asset returns, we
decompose the score function--a key component in diffusion models--using
time-varying orthogonal projections, and this decomposition is incorporated
into the design of neural network architectures. We derive rigorous statistical
guarantees, establishing nonasymptotic error bounds for both score estimation
at O(d^{5/2} n^{-2/(k+5)}) and generated distribution at O(d^{5/4}
n^{-1/2(k+5)}), primarily driven by the intrinsic factor dimension k rather
than the number of assets d, surpassing the dimension-dependent limits in the
classical nonparametric statistics literature and making the framework viable
for markets with thousands of assets. Numerical studies confirm superior
performance in latent subspace recovery under small data regimes. Empirical
analysis demonstrates the economic significance of our framework in
constructing mean-variance optimal portfolios and factor portfolios. This work
presents the first theoretical integration of factor structure with diffusion
models, offering a principled approach for high-dimensional financial
simulation with limited data.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06566v1,,False
GTS-LUM: Reshaping User Behavior Modeling with LLMs in Telecommunications Industry,09/04/2025,"Liu Shi, Tianwu Zhou, Wei Xu, Li Liu, Zhexin Cui, Shaoyi Liang, Haoxing Niu, Yichong Tian, Jianwei Guo","As telecommunication service providers shifting their focus to analyzing user
behavior for package design and marketing interventions, a critical challenge
lies in developing a unified, end-to-end framework capable of modeling
long-term and periodic user behavior sequences with diverse time granularities,
multi-modal data inputs, and heterogeneous labels. This paper introduces
GTS-LUM, a novel user behavior model that redefines modeling paradigms in
telecommunication settings. GTS-LUM adopts a (multi-modal) encoder-adapter-LLM
decoder architecture, enhanced with several telecom-specific innovations.
Specifically, the model incorporates an advanced timestamp processing method to
handle varying time granularities. It also supports multi-modal data inputs --
including structured tables and behavior co-occurrence graphs -- and aligns
these with semantic information extracted by a tokenizer using a Q-former
structure. Additionally, GTS-LUM integrates a front-placed target-aware
mechanism to highlight historical behaviors most relevant to the target.
Extensive experiments on industrial dataset validate the effectiveness of this
end-to-end framework and also demonstrate that GTS-LUM outperforms LLM4Rec
approaches which are popular in recommendation systems, offering an effective
and generalizing solution for user behavior modeling in telecommunications.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06511v1,,False
Data-driven Fuzzy Control for Time-Optimal Aggressive Trajectory Following,09/04/2025,"August Phelps, Juan Augusto Paredes Salazar, Ankit Goel","Optimal trajectories that minimize a user-defined cost function in dynamic
systems require the solution of a two-point boundary value problem. The
optimization process yields an optimal control sequence that depends on the
initial conditions and system parameters. However, the optimal sequence may
result in undesirable behavior if the system's initial conditions and
parameters are erroneous. This work presents a data-driven fuzzy controller
synthesis framework that is guided by a time-optimal trajectory for multicopter
tracking problems. In particular, we consider an aggressive maneuver consisting
of a mid-air flip and generate a time-optimal trajectory by numerically solving
the two-point boundary value problem. A fuzzy controller consisting of a
stabilizing controller near hover conditions and an autoregressive moving
average (ARMA) controller, trained to mimic the time-optimal aggressive
trajectory, is constructed using the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy framework.",http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.06500v1,,False
